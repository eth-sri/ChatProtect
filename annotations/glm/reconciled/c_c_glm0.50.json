The Bailey-Thompson House is an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, featuring a steeply-pitched roof, asymmetrical façade, and ornate detailing. The home has a wrap-around porch, a turret, and a large bay window, all of which add to its distinctive appearance. Over the years, the Bailey-Thompson House has been used for a variety of purposes, including as a private residence, a boarding house, and a law office. In 1973, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places, recognizing its significance as an important example of late 19th-century architecture in Florida.",

Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a lack of iron in their diets and developed a treatment that involved giving them iron supplements. He also studied sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated physician who worked tirelessly to improve the care of sick children. He was a founding member of the Boston Children's Hospital and served as its chief of pediatrics from 1924 to 1949. He was also a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.",
