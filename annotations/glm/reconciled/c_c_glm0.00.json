Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia in infants, which was a common and often fatal condition at the time. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron in their diet, and he developed a treatment that involved feeding infants liver, which is rich in iron. Blackfan also made significant contributions to the understanding of erythroblastosis fetalis, a condition in which a mother's antibodies attack her fetus's red blood cells. He discovered that the condition was caused by a mismatch between the mother's and the fetus's blood types, and he developed a treatment that involved exchanging the baby's blood with blood from a compatible donor.",

He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University, where he became a member of the Holy Club, a group of devout students led by John Wesley. Whitefield became known for his powerful preaching style, which emphasized the need for personal conversion and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Wales, preaching to large crowds in open fields and marketplaces. He also made several trips to America, where he preached in cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Whitefield's preaching had a profound impact on the American colonies, helping to spark a wave of religious enthusiasm and social reform.",
