This suggests that Persipura Jayapura often plays matches at Pattimura Stadium.

Statement 2 also mentions Persipura Jayapura, but in a more general sense, by saying that the club has played several matches at Pattimura Stadium. This does not contradict the first statement, as it simply confirms that Persipura Jayapura is a tenant team at Pattimura Stadium and has played matches there.

Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about Pattimura Stadium and Persipura Jayapura's relationship to the stadium.

Description:
Pattimura Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Ambon, the capital city of Maluku Province, Indonesia. It was built in 2006 and has a seating capacity of 20,000 people. The stadium is named after Thomas Matulessy, also known as Pattimura, who was a national hero from Maluku and led a rebellion against the Dutch colonizers during the 19th century. Pattimura Stadium is primarily used for football matches, as it is the home stadium of Persiram Raja Ampat, a professional football club that competes in the Indonesian Liga 2.

Statement 1:
The stadium has also hosted other sporting events such as boxing, martial arts, and volleyball.

Statement 2:
The stadium has also hosted various cultural events and concerts.

Please explain whether the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory.

This implies that the stadium has a diverse range of facilities and is capable of hosting multiple types of events.

On the other hand, Statement 2 mentions that the stadium has hosted various cultural events and concerts, indicating that it is not solely dedicated to sports events. This does not contradict the first statement as it simply means that the stadium has additional capabilities beyond sporting events.

Description:
Pattimura Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Ambon, the capital city of Maluku province in Indonesia.

The stadium was built in 1980 and underwent major renovations in 1997 and 2014 to increase its seating capacity and upgrade its facilities. It can now accommodate up to 20,000 spectators and has modern amenities such as a VIP and media section, floodlights, and a scoreboard. Pattimura Stadium is primarily used for football matches and is the home ground of Persipura Jayapura, a professional Indonesian football club.

Description:
Pattimura Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Ambon, the capital city of Maluku Province, Indonesia. It was built in 2006 and has a seating capacity of 20,000 people. The stadium is named after Thomas Matulessy, also known as Pattimura, who was a national hero from Maluku and led a rebellion against the Dutch colonizers during the 19th century.

Statement 1:
Pattimura Stadium is primarily used for football matches, as it is the home stadium of Persiram Raja Ampat, a professional football club that competes in the Indonesian Liga 2.

It is the home stadium of Persiram Raja Ampat, a professional football club based in West Papua, Indonesia.
