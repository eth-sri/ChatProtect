Description:
Joe Ledley is a retired Welsh professional footballer. He was born on January 23, 1987, in Cardiff, Wales. He began his career at Cardiff City in 2004 and played for them until 2010, making over 200 appearances during his time there. In 2010, Ledley moved to Scottish giants Celtic on a free transfer. During his time at Celtic, he won four Scottish Premiership titles and played in the UEFA Champions League. In 2014, he left Celtic to join Crystal Palace in the English Premier League. Ledley became a key player for Crystal Palace under manager Alan Pardew and helped the club reach the FA Cup final in 2016. He left Crystal Palace in 2018 and went on to play for Derby County in the English Championship for two seasons before retiring in 2020. On the international stage, Ledley represented Wales at the senior level from 2005 to 2018, earning 77 caps and scoring four goals.

Statement 1:
He was part of the Welsh squad that reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016, which was a historic achievement for Welsh football.

In the semi-finals of Euro 2016, Joe Ledley was a key player for the Welsh national team.

Please explain whether the statements about joe ledley are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Joe Ledley are not contradictory.

The first statement mentions that Ledley was part of the Welsh squad that reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016, indicating that he was a member of the team but not necessarily a key player.

The second statement, however, specifically mentions that Ledley was a key player for the Welsh national team in the semi-finals of Euro 2016. While it does not contradict the first statement, it provides additional information about Ledley's role in the team's success.

Therefore, the two statements can be considered complementary, rather than contradictory, as they offer different perspectives on Ledley's contributions to the Welsh national team during Euro 2016.
