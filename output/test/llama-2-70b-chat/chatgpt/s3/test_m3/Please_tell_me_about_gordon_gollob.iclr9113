He quickly rose through the ranks and became a squadron leader in 1939. Gollob was a skilled fighter pilot and was credited with 150 aerial victories during his career. He was known for his aggressive tactics and was often sent on missions to take out enemy aircraft before they could attack German bombers. In 1942, Gollob was promoted to the rank of Major and was given command of JG 77, a fighter wing. He led his wing in many successful missions, including the defense of Sicily and the Battle of Kursk.

He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military honor in Germany at the time.

This could refer to the end of World War II, which occurred in September 1945, or it could refer to another event that happened in that year that caused Gollob's retirement or discharge from the military.\n\nTherefore, the two statements do not contradict each other, as they refer to different aspects of Gollob's life and career."]}
