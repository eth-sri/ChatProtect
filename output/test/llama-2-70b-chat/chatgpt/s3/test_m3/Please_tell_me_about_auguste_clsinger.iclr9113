This style is characterized by a return to the artistic principles of ancient Greece and Rome, and often features idealized figures and mythological subjects.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, describes Cl\u00e9singer's work as realistic and detailed, which suggests a focus on accuracy and attention to detail in his sculptures. This style is characterized by a commitment to representing the world as it truly is, rather than idealizing or romanticizing it.\n\nWhile these two descriptions may seem at odds with each other, it's important to note that artists often work in different styles and modes throughout their careers, and Cl\u00e9singer's work may have evolved over time. Additionally, it's possible that Cl\u00e9singer's work blended elements of both neoclassicism and realism, creating a unique style that combined the best of both worlds.\n\nTherefore, while the two statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer may seem contradictory at first glance, they actually highlight the complexity and diversity of his artistic style."]}
