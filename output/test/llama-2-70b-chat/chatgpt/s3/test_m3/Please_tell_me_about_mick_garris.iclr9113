A publicist is a professional who helps to promote and manage the public image of a person, organization, or product. This statement suggests that Garris started his career in the entertainment industry in a different role, focused on public relations and promotion, rather than creative production.\n\nWhile the two statements describe different aspects of Garris's career, they do not contradict each other. It is possible for someone to start their career in one field and later transition to another, related field. In this case, Garris appears to have started in television production and later shifted to public relations and promotion for the film industry."]}
