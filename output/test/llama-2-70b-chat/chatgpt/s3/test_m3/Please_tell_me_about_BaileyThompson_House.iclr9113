The first modification, mentioned in Statement 1, was the addition of rear wings and the enclosure of the front porch, which took place in 1907. The second modification, mentioned in Statement 2, was the addition of a two-story rear wing, which took place in the late 19th century, possibly during the time when George L. Thompson first purchased the house.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they provide a coherent account of the modifications made to the Bailey-Thompson House by George L. Thompson."]}
