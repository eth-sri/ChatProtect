Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was a prominent American pediatric hematologist who made significant contributions to the field of blood transfusion and the treatment of anemia in children. Blackfan spent most of his career at the Children's Hospital in Boston, where he worked as a physician and researcher. He specialized in the study of blood disorders in children, particularly anemia, and developed new techniques for blood transfusion and the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia. One of Blackfan's most notable discoveries was the identification of a new type of anemia that he named \"hypoplastic anemia.\" He determined that this type of anemia was caused by a failure of the bone marrow to produce enough red blood cells, and he developed new treatments using blood transfusions and steroids to stimulate the bone marrow and increase the production of red blood cells. Blackfan was also a pioneer in the field of blood transfusion, developing new methods for preserving and storing blood and developing a technique for cross-matching blood types to prevent transfusion reactions. Throughout his career, Blackfan received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to the field of pediatric hematology.\n\nStatement 1:\nHe died in Boston.\n\nStatement 2:\nHe died in 1941 at the age of 60.\n\nPlease explain whether the statements about c. t. blackfan are contradictory.\nProvide your explanation only.\n", "A": [" The two statements about C.T.
