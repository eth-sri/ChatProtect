He was born on May 26, 1922, in Montreal, Quebec, and died on October 14, 1988, in Sainte-Ad\u00e8le, Quebec. He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of environmental education and his efforts to promote environmental conservation in Canada. Seguin earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Montreal in 1948. He then went on to work as a researcher at the National Research Council of Canada, where he conducted groundbreaking research on the effects of radiation on living organisms. He was also a professor of biochemistry at the University of Montreal and the director of the Institute of Environmental Sciences at the University of Quebec. In addition to his scientific work, Seguin was a prolific filmmaker and produced numerous documentaries on environmental issues. He was one of the founders of the National Film Board of Canada's Studio D, which focused on producing films by and about women. He also served as the president of the Canadian Environmental Foundation and was a member of the Canadian Council of Resource and Environment Ministers. Throughout his career, Seguin was a passionate advocate for environmental conservation and sustainability. He believed that education was the key to promoting environmental awareness and worked tirelessly to promote environmental education in Canada.

{"Q": "I give you the beginning of a description about fernand seguin.\nThen follow two statements.\n\nDescription:\nFernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian biochemist, broadcaster, and science communicator. He was born in Montreal and studied biochemistry at McGill University. After completing his PhD in 1947, he worked as a researcher at the National Research Council of Canada. Seguin was passionate about science communication and believed that scientific knowledge should be accessible to everyone. He hosted a popular science radio program called \"Quelle est cette science?\" (\"What is this science?\") on Radio-Canada from 1960 to 1985. He also wrote several books and articles on science and technology. Seguin was a pioneer in the field of environmental toxicology, studying the effects of pollutants on living organisms. He was particularly concerned about the impact of pesticides on the environment and human health. He was a vocal advocate for environmental protection and played a key role in the establishment of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in 1971.\n\nStatement 1:\nSeguin received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to science and science communication, including the Order of Canada.\n\nStatement 2:\nSeguin received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including the Order of Canada in 1975.\n\nPlease explain whether the statements about fernand seguin are contradictory.\nProvide your explanation only.\n", "A": [" The two statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory.
