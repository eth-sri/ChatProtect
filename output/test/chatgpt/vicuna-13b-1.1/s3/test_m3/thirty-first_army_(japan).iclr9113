It was formed in mid-1944 and stationed in Rangoon, Burma, under the control of the Southern Army (南軍, Nangun). Its main role was to defend against potential Allied amphibious landings along the southern coast of Burma. The Thirty-First Army was primarily composed of troops from Korea, China and Indochina, who were recruited and trained locally. The formation was encircled and eventually destroyed by Allied forces during the Battle of Rangoon in early 1945, with the surviving troops being evacuated to Malaya by sea. The commanders of the Thirty-First Army included General Suzuki Tei (鈴木哲重), who later served as the last Prime Minister of Japan during the final stages of the war.

Statement 1:
After the war, the Thirty-First Army was disbanded, and its former personnel were integrated into the post-war Japan Self-Defense Forces.

Statement 2:
the Thirty-First Army was disbanded after its defeat in the Battle of Rangoon.
