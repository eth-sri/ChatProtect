However, the party won a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament of Burkina Faso, with Philomène Sawadogo being elected as Senator for the Daspiga Chiefdom constituency. Sawadogo had previously served as Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development in the government of Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba, and had resigned from that position in March 2019 in protest against the government's handling of a border dispute with Mali.

Statement 1:
She later founded the PEDB and ran for President in the 2021 Burkinabé presidential election, but did not garner enough votes to advance to the second round of voting.

Statement 2:
She later founded and ran the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina.

Please explain whether the statements about Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Philomène Sawadogo founded the party and ran for President in the 2021 election, while Statement 2 suggests that she only founded the party. Since Statement 1 implies that Sawadogo ran for President, it contradicts the information in the description that none of the party's candidates were elected to the National Assembly in the 2020 election. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true.

The party was founded in 2005 by a group of ecologists, activists, and intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the political status quo and wanted to promote a more ecologically sustainable and socially just development model in the country. The PEDB is committed to promoting ecological practices and protecting the environment, and it seeks to build a more equitable and democratic society that prioritizes the needs of marginalized communities. The party also emphasizes the importance of education, culture, and participatory democracy, and it seeks to create a more inclusive political system that allows for the full expression of citizens' needs and aspirations. In the 2012 and 2019 legislative elections, the PEDB won a total of three seats in the National Assembly, making it one of the smaller parties in the Burkinabe political landscape.
