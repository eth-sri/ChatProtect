He became an Anglican priest and developed a reputation as a powerful preacher, known for his enthusiastic and emotional style.

Description:
George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English-born Anglican clergyman who played a significant role in the religious and intellectual history of the British Empire. He was one of the leaders of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, and was a prominent figure in the Great Awakening, a wave of religious enthusiasm that swept through the British colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at the University of Oxford. After serving as a curate in several parishes in England, he was invited to the American colonies in 1738 by John Wesley, with whom he had formed a close relationship. In the colonies, Whitefield became one of the most influential figures in the Great Awakening. He traveled extensively throughout the colonies, preaching to large crowds of people, often outside of traditional church buildings. His fiery sermons and emotional appeals had a powerful impact on his listeners, and he became known as the "Grand Itinerant" of the American colonies. Whitefield's influence extended beyond the religious sphere. He was a vocal advocate for the rights of the American colonists, and played a significant role in the revolutionary movement that led to the Declaration of Independence. He also played a key role in the founding of the University of Pennsylvania, which was established with the express purpose of providing a education for future leaders of the colonies. Whitefield remained a prominent figure in religious and intellectual circles until his death in 1770.

Description:
George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican cleric who played a significant role in the spiritual and social development of early America. He was one of the leaders of the Great Awakening, a period of religious revival in the 18th century that swept through the British colonies in America. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford. He became an Anglican priest and developed a reputation as a powerful preacher, known for his enthusiastic and emotional style. He gained a large following in England and became a popular figure in the religious and social life of London. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America to serve as a missionary to the British colonists. He was initially met with skepticism and even hostility from many of the established clergymen in the colonies, who saw him as a threat to their authority. However, Whitefield's powerful preaching and personal charisma soon won over many audiences, and he became a major figure in the Great Awakening. During his time in America, Whitefield traveled extensively, preaching to large crowds in cities and towns throughout the colonies. He established a network of supporters and built a number of churches, including one in Philadelphia that became known as Whitefield's Tabernacle.

Description:
George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an Anglican clergyman who played a significant role in the early days of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the American colonies. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. Whitefield was a proponent of the evangelical movement, which emphasized the need for a personal relationship with God and the importance of living a life of holiness. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America as a missionary, and he quickly gained a large following due to his powerful preaching style and his passion for spreading the Gospel. He was particularly effective in reaching out to the colonists who were not affiliated with the established churches, and his itinerant preaching style helped to establish the concept of an "evangelical circuit" in the colonies. Whitefield was a friend and colleague of Jonathan Edwards and other prominent evangelical leaders of his time, and he played a key role in the growth and development of the Episcopal Church in America. He established the first Episcopal ministers' conference in 1743, and he was a strong advocate for the establishment of new churches and the training of new clergy. Whitefield was also a strong opponent of the slave trade and worked to educate the colonists on the immorality of owning slaves. He used his platform as a preacher to speak out against slavery and urged his congregants to treat their slave populations with compassion and kindness.

Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at the University of Oxford.

Statement 1:
After serving as a curate in several parishes in England, he was invited to the American colonies in 1738 by John Wesley, with whom he had formed a close relationship.

Description:
George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an Anglican clergyman who played a significant role in the early days of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the American colonies. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. Whitefield was a proponent of the evangelical movement, which emphasized the need for a personal relationship with God and the importance of living a life of holiness. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America as a missionary, and he quickly gained a large following due to his powerful preaching style and his passion for spreading the Gospel. He was particularly effective in reaching out to the colonists who were not affiliated with the established churches, and his itinerant preaching style helped to establish the concept of an "evangelical circuit" in the colonies. Whitefield was a friend and colleague of Jonathan Edwards and other prominent evangelical leaders of his time, and he played a key role in the growth and development of the Episcopal Church in America. He established the first Episcopal ministers' conference in 1743, and he was a strong advocate for the establishment of new churches and the training of new clergy.

Statement 1:
Whitefield was also a strong opponent of the slave trade and worked to educate the colonists on the immorality of owning slaves.

as a strong opponent of the slave trade during his time as a missionary in America.
