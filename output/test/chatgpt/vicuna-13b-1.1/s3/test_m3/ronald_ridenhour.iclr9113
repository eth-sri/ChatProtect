Ronald Ridenhour was a former U.S. Army soldier who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the Vietnam War. He was born on August 16, 1948, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and enlisted in the Army in 1968. During the early morning hours of March 26, 1969, Ridenhour was serving as a radio operator with the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam when he witnessed a massive explosion which destroyed his company's command post and severely damaged his own bunker. Despite the danger, Ridenhour immediately moved from his cover to assist in rescuing those trapped in the rubble. Incredibly brave and selfless, Ridenhour systematically searched the destroyed area, pulling out soldiers who had been buried and administering medical aid to the wounded. Despite the continuous danger from enemy sniper fire and explosions, he continued to work tirelessly for over three hours, until he had helped to rescue more than 20 soldiers. For his extraordinary heroism and selflessness, Ridenhour was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson on June 27, 1969. He was the first African American to receive the medal for heroism in Vietnam. After being discharged from the Army, Ridenhour returned to civilian life and settled in California.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about ronald ridenhour.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Ronald Ridenhour was an American investigative journalist and activist who is best known for his work exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. In 1969, Ridenhour received a letter from a former US soldier who had witnessed the massacre and was deeply troubled by what he had seen. Inspired by this letter, Ridenhour began his own investigation into the incident, which led to the uncovering of evidence of widespread human rights abuses by US troops in Vietnam. Ridenhour's work was instrumental in bringing the My Lai Massacre to public attention and led to a Congressional inquiry into the conduct of US forces in Vietnam. As a result of his efforts, several US soldiers were charged with war crimes and eventually convicted. In recognition of his work, Ridenhour was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970.

Statement 1:
In addition to his work as a journalist, Ridenhour was also an advocate for human rights and social justice.

Statement 2:
