It is one of the 12 constellations that were listed by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his 150-year series of astronomical works, the Almagest. Perseus is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is best known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing Andromeda from a sea monster. In the sky, Perseus is represented by a constellation that bears his name and consists of several stars and galaxy clusters.

Statement 1:
One of the stars in the constellation of Perseus is Mirfak, which is the second brightest star in the constellation and can be found near the middle of the constellation.

Statement 2:
The second brightest star in the constellation Perseus can be found near the bottom of the constellation, to the east of the famous "Double Cluster" (NGC 869 and NGC 884).

Please explain whether the statements about Perseus (constellation) are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: Yes, the statements about Perseus (constellation) are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the second brightest star in the constellation is Mirfak, which is located near the middle of the constellation. However, statement 2 says that the second brightest star can be found near the bottom of the constellation, to the east of the "Double Cluster". These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, so they are contradictory.

Description:
Perseus is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac and is located between Cassiopeia and Cepheus. It is named for the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is said to have killed the Gorgon Medusa and rescued Andromeda from a sea monster. Perseus is bordered by the constellations of Andromeda, Triangulum, and Camelopardalis. It contains several bright stars, including the bright orange star Algol, which is the medieval$), the second-brightest star in the constellation, and the naked eyeåned star, which is the 59th brightest star in the sky. The constellation is also home to several deep sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, which is a group of two open clusters containing hundreds of stars, and the Perseus Faint Cluster, which is a group of stars that is more difficult to observe. There are several different myths about the origin of the constellation of Perseus. One story says that he was placed in the heavens by Zeus as a reward for his bravery in defeating the Gorgon Medusa and freeing Andromeda from the sea monster.

Statement 1:
Another story says that he was placed in the heavens by Poseidon as a punishment for his arrogance in boasting about his conquests.

Statement 2:
Perseus was placed in the constellation by Zeus.

Please explain whether the statements about Perseus (constellation) are contradictory.

Description:
Perseus is a constellation in the northern sky, located between the constellations of Auriga and Taurus. It is one of the 88 modern constellations and was first defined by the Italian astronomer, Gian stuilio Casseopia in the 16th century. The constellation is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is known for killing the Medusa and rescuing Andromeda. Perseus is a large constellation that covers an area of about 1094 square degrees and it is located within the bounds of the milky way, making it a great place to observe galaxies and other deep sky objects. Perseus is home to several notable astronomical objects, including the Perseus cluster, the Caldwell 65 star cluster, and the famous spiral galaxy, M31, also known as the Andromeda galaxy. Perseus is easy to spot in the sky, as it contains several easily recognizable asterisms, or patterns of stars, such as the "Double Perseus" which is composed of two stars that are relatively close to each other.

Statement 1:
Perseus is also home of the Perseid meteor shower which occurs every year between July 17 and August 24.

The Perseid meteor shower occurs in the constellation Perseus.
