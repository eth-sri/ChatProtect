Kelley (played by Autumn Reeser) - a free-spirited artist who's always up for a new adventure. She's a bit of a wild card, but she has a good heart. 4. Lily (played by Nikki Cox) - a former model who's now a struggling actress. She's a bit shallow, but she's also very caring and loyal to her friends. 5.
