Born on April 21, 1946, in Oakland, California, Ridenhour grew up in a military family and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1967. He served as a door gunner on a helicopter in Vietnam and was decorated for his service, receiving the Bronze Star and the Army Commendation Medal. In March 1968, Ridenhour's unit, the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Infantry Brigade, was involved in a operation in the village of My Lai in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province, South Vietnam. During the operation, Ridenhour witnessed the mass killing of hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and the elderly, by U.S. soldiers. Appalled by what he had seen, Ridenhour felt compelled to speak out against the atrocities that had been committed. After speaking to his superiors and receiving no response, Ridenhour wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, and the Pentagon's Inspector General, detailing the events he had witnessed and calling for an investigation. The letter was circulated among several members of Congress and eventually became public, sparking widespread outrage and investigations into the massacre. The Army launched an investigation into the My Lai Massacre in April 1969, and Ridenhour testified before the Peers Commission, which was established to investigate the incident. His testimony, along with that of other witnesses, revealed the brutal truth about the massacre, and several soldiers were eventually charged and convicted of war crimes.
