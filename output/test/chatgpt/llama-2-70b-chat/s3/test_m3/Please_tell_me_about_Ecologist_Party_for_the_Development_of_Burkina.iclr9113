The PEDB's main goals include promoting sustainable agriculture, protecting natural resources, and addressing climate change. The party also focuses on issues such as education, health, and gender equality, recognizing the interconnectedness of these issues with environmental sustainability. The party has contested several elections, including the 2012 general elections, in which it fielded candidates for the presidency, national assembly, and local government positions. While it has not yet won a significant number of seats, the party has been vocal in advocating for policies that prioritize environmental protection and sustainable development. In addition to its political activities, the PEDB also engages in social and environmental activism, organizing campaigns to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainable practices in communities across the country.
