Please explain whether the statements about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. The description states that EC Graz finished on top of the table with 75 points, but there is no mention of Markus Peintner being the league's leading scorer or scoring the most goals in the regular season. Statement 1 contradicts this by stating that Markus Peintner was the league's leading scorer with 111 points in 37 games, while Statement 2 contradicts it by stating that Markus Peintner scored the most goals in the regular season with 47 goals in 42 games. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time.
