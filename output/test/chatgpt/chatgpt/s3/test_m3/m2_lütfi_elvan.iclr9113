Please explain whether the statements about lütfi elvan are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory, but they are slightly different. Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015, which is true. However, statement 2 says that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election, which is also true but more specific. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the parliament of Turkey, so both statements refer to Elvan's election to a parliamentary position in 2015.
