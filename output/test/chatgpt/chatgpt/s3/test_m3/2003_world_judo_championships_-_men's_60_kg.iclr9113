Nomura was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a seven-time world champion. Choi Min-Ho won the silver medal, making it his second consecutive world championships final appearance. The bronze medals were secured by Brazil's João Derly and Russia's Yuri Alvear. Derly defeated France's David Larose, while Alvear overcame Venezuelan Javier Guedez in their respective bronze medal matches.

Statement 1:
The new rules included reducing the duration of the matches, making them more fast-paced, and introducing a sudden-death golden score rule in case of a tie.
