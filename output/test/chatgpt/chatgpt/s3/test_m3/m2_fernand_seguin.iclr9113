Description:
Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian biochemist, broadcaster, and science communicator. He was born in Montreal and studied biochemistry at McGill University. After completing his PhD in 1947, he worked as a researcher at the National Research Council of Canada. Seguin was passionate about science communication and believed that scientific knowledge should be accessible to everyone. He hosted a popular science radio program called "Quelle est cette science?" ("What is this science?") on Radio-Canada from 1960 to 1985. He also wrote several books and articles on science and technology. Seguin was a pioneer in the field of environmental toxicology, studying the effects of pollutants on living organisms. He was particularly concerned about the impact of pesticides on the environment and human health. He was a vocal advocate for environmental protection and played a key role in the establishment of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in 1971.

Statement 1:
Seguin received the Order of Canada in 1973 for his contributions to science and science communication.

Statement 2:
Seguin received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including the Order of Canada in 1975.
