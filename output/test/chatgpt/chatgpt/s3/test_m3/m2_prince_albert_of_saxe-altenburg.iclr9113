Then follow two statements.

Description:
Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1819-1902) was a member of the German aristocracy and the younger brother of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was educated at the University of Bonn. In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Karl of Prussia and a niece of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. The couple had three children: Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg, Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg, and Prince Ernst II of Saxe-Altenburg.

Statement 2:
Prince Albert served as a general in the Prussian army.

Please explain whether the statements about prince albert of saxe-altenburg are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he served as a captain in the Saxon Army, while statement 2 says that he served as a general in the Prussian army. These two armies belonged to different states and were often in conflict with each other, so it is unlikely that Prince Albert could have served in both at the same time. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true.
