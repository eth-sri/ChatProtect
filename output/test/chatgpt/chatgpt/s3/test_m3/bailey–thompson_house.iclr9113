Q: I give you the beginning of a description about Bailey–Thompson House.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1847 by William G. Ponder, a prominent contractor in the area, for his family. The home is a two-story, Greek Revival-style building with a large central hall and six rooms on each floor.

Statement 1:
In 1891, the home was purchased by the Bailey family, who lived there for many years.

Statement 2:
The Bailey family lived in the house for over 50 years, from 1865 to 1917.

Please explain whether the statements about Bailey–Thompson House are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the Bailey family purchased the home in 1891 and lived there for many years, while statement 2 says that the Bailey family lived in the house from 1865 to 1917. Since the home was built in 1847, it is not possible for the Bailey family to have lived there before they purchased it in 1891. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true.
