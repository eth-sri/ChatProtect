Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that he fought in the wars of Schleswig and Holstein in 1848-1851, while Statement 2 suggests that he fought in the wars of 1866 and 1870-71 as a general in the Prussian army.

Description:
Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1819-1902) was a member of the German aristocracy and the younger brother of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was born in Altenburg, Germany, and was educated at the University of Bonn. In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Karl of Prussia and a niece of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. The couple had three children: Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg, Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg, and Prince Ernst II of Saxe-Altenburg. Prince Albert served as a lieutenant in the Prussian Army and later became a captain in the Saxon Army. He was also a member of the German Confederation's federal assembly and served as an advisor to his brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1866, Prince Albert's brother helped to lead the pro-Austrian forces in the Austro-Prussian War, and Prince Albert himself was briefly exiled from Saxe-Altenburg as a result. However, he was able to return to his homeland after the war ended. Prince Albert died in 1902 at the age of 82 and was buried in the royal mausoleum in Altenburg.

Statement 1:

Statement 2:
His son, Prince Ernst II, succeeded him as the last reigning Duke of Saxe-Altenburg.

A: The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that his son, Prince Ernst II, succeeded him, but the second statement adds the detail that Prince Ernst II was the last reigning Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. This does not contradict the first statement, as it is still true that Prince Ernst II succeeded his father as ruler of Saxe-Altenburg.
