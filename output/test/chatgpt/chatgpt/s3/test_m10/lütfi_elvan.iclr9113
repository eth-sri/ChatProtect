Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, without specifying how long he served in that position.

Step 3: Since Statement 2 does not contradict Statement 1, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.

Step 2: The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.

Step 3: As both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, there is no direct contradiction between them.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1: "He was then appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, a position he held until 2015."
- Statement 2: "He was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013."
- Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.
- Statement 1 adds that he held the position until 2015.
- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.

Step 2: The second statement says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 but does not mention when he left the position.

Step 3: Since the second statement does not provide any information about Elvan's tenure as the Minister of Development, it is not contradictory to the first statement.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 and Statement 2 both mention that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.

Step 2: In Statement 1, it is mentioned that he held the position until 2015. However, in Statement 2, there is no mention of how long he held the position.

Step 3: It is possible that he was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 but resigned or was dismissed before 2015, which would make both statements true and not contradictory. However, if he held the position until 2015 as mentioned in Statement 1, then Statement 2 would be incomplete and would not give the full picture.

Step 4: Therefore, depending on whether or not Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015, the two statements could be contradictory or non-contradictory.

Conclusion: The answer cannot be determined without additional information about how long Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1: He was then appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, a position he held until 2015.
- Statement 2: He was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.

The two statements seem to present a contradiction because statement 1 implies that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 but left the position in 2015, while statement 2 only mentions the appointment without specifying any end date. 

However, the contradiction may be resolved if we consider that statement 1 provides additional information about Elvan's career but does not necessarily contradict statement 2. For example, Elvan may have been appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and then later promoted to the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance, which he currently holds.

Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.
Step 3: Both statements agree that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.
Step 4: Statement 1 adds that Lütfi Elvan held the position until 2015, but statement 2 does not specify a time frame.

Conclusion: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory, but statement 1 provides additional information that is not present in statement 2. Therefore, the answer is no.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as Minister of Development in 2013.

Step 3: There is no contradiction between the two statements, as Statement 2 simply provides additional information about Lütfi Elvan's appointment as Minister of Development without specifying the length of his tenure in the position. Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, without stating when he left the position.
- These statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as Statement 1 includes the information in Statement 2 and adds that he left the position in 2015.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes the information in Statement 2 but provides additional details about the time period Elvan held the position.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.

- Statement 2 mentions that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Istanbul in the 2015 general election.
- There is no information in the description to suggest that Elvan stopped being a Member of Parliament during any period between 2002 and 2015.
- Therefore, it is possible for both statements to be true if Elvan served as a Member of Parliament from the Aydin constituency until the 2015 general election, after which he switched his constituency and ran from Istanbul.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan began his political career in 2002, while Statement 2 mentions his election as a Member of Parliament in the 2015 general election.

Step 2: Both statements are referring to different points in Elvan's political career - Statement 1 is talking about the beginning of his career, while Statement 2 is talking about a later point.

3. Both statements mention Lütfi Elvan's role as a Member of Parliament.
4. However, statement 1 does not mention the specific province from which Elvan was elected, while statement 2 does.
5. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information that complements each other.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
Step 3: The two statements are not contradictory because Statement 1 does not specify the province for which Lütfi Elvan was elected, while Statement 2 provides that information. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time.
Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: 1. Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role.
2. Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Both statements mention Lütfi Elvan being elected as a member of parliament.
- However, statement 1 does not specify which province or district he was elected from.
- Statement 2 specifies that he was elected from the province of Karaman, but only mentions the 2015 election.
- Therefore, the two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as they could both be true depending on the context. For example, Lütfi Elvan could have been elected in 2011 and continued to serve as a member of parliament, but then later been re-elected in 2015 specifically from the province of Karaman.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role. 

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election. 

Step 3: Since both the statements mention Lütfi Elvan as a Member of Parliament, they are not necessarily contradictory. 

Step 4: However, Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan has been serving as an MP continuously since 2011, while Statement 2 mentions his election in the 2015 general election. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory, but they provide different information about Lütfi Elvan's electoral history as a Member of Parliament.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan has been a Member of Parliament for the AKP since 2011.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
Step 3: Since both statements mention Lütfi Elvan serving as a Member of Parliament, they are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 indicates that Lütfi Elvan has been a member of parliament for the AKP since 2011.

Step 2: Statement 2 indicates that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other. It is possible that Lütfi Elvan was a member of parliament for the AKP before being elected to represent Karaman in the 2015 election.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: These statements do not necessarily contradict each other. Statement 1 does not specify which province or district Elvan was elected from, while Statement 2 only identifies the province from which he was elected in 2015.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991, which suggests that he went to a different university for his doctorate.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Ladik, a district in Samsun province, Turkey. Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984. He then earned a master's degree in Finance from the same university in 1986. In 1991, he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, in the United Kingdom. Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked in various positions until 2002. Between 2011 and 2013, he served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications. He was then appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, a position he held until 2015. In November 2015, Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Statement 1:
He was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.

Statement 2:
He was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1: He was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
- Statement 2: He was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.

The two statements seem to contradict each other because statement 1 suggests that Elvan only became a minister in May 2016, while statement 2 suggests that he became a minister in 2013. However, upon closer inspection, statement 1 refers to a specific ministerial position (Minister of Development) that Elvan held for a specific period (May 2016 to July 2018), while statement 2 refers to a different ministerial position (Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications) that Elvan held earlier in his career (between 2011 and 2013). Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, and Elvan could have held both positions at different times.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Compare Statement 1 and Statement 2. 
Statement 1: He was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
Statement 2: He was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.

Step 2: Identify the positions stated in each statement.
Statement 1: Minister of Development
Statement 2: Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications

Step 3: Compare the dates mentioned in each statement.
Statement 1: May 2016 - July 2018
Statement 2: 2013

Step 4: Determine if the two statements are contradictory.
Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development from May 2016 until July 2018. 
Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013. 
Since there is no mention of Lütfi Elvan holding both positions simultaneously, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.
Step 3: The two statements refer to different positions held by Lütfi Elvan at different times. 
Step 4: There is no explicit or implicit indication that the two positions were held simultaneously or that they were held consecutively in order.
Step 5: Therefore, the statements are not contradictory. 
Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
2. Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.
3. It is not explicitly stated in the description whether Lütfi Elvan held both positions simultaneously or if he was appointed as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications before being appointed as Minister of Development.
4. However, based on the chronological order of events stated in the description, it is more likely that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications first, and then was appointed as Minister of Development.
5. Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.
- These two statements seem to refer to different positions held by Elvan at different times.
- However, statement 2 does not mention that Elvan also served as the Minister of Development, which would indicate a discrepancy between the two statements regarding Elvan's career trajectory.
- Therefore, the two statements are potentially contradictory, but not necessarily so.

Step 2: The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991. 

Step 3: These two statements are contradictory as they cannot both be true. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.
2. Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.
3. Both statements cannot be true, as they refer to different universities from which Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. degree.
4. Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree in Finance from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.

Step 3: Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1 by saying that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 4: Both cannot be true simultaneously since one mentions the University of Exeter and the other mentions Ankara University.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.

Step 2: The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 3: These two statements seem to be contradictory as they state that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. from two different universities.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 4: Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.

Step 2: The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The initial description states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree in Finance from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2a: Statement 1 states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.

Step 2b: Statement 2 states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 3: Since Step 1 indicates that Lütfi Elvan obtained his master's degree from Ankara University and not from the University of Exeter, Statement 1 and the initial description appear to be contradictory. Statement 2, on the other hand, does not conflict with the initial description.

Conclusion: Yes, Statement 1 contradicts the initial description, while Statement 2 does not.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The description states that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree in Finance from Ankara University in 1986.
2. Statement 1 claims that he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter in 1991, without mentioning his Ph.D. from Ankara University.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: The two statements suggest that Elvan has graduated from two different faculties, one in Political Science and the other in Civil Engineering.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: According to the beginning of the description, Lütfi Elvan is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.
Step 3: Statement 2 says that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.
Step 4: Based on the information given, there is no mention of which degree Elvan obtained - a degree in political science or civil engineering.
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, as they are both true but apply to different areas of Elvan's education.
Conclusion: No
A: Reasoning:
The description only provides information about Lütfi Elvan's position and birthplace, but not his educational background. The two statements, however, provide different information about his academic degree, one saying that he graduated from the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University, and the other saying that he graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. These two statements cannot both be true since he cannot have graduated from two different universities at the same time and in two different fields of study.

Conclusion:
Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan is a politician who serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: The description states that Elvan was born in Ladik, Turkey.

Step 3: Statement 1 claims that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.

Step 4: Statement 2 claims that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey and was born on March 12, 1962, in Ladik, a district in Samsun province, Turkey.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: Since the two statements do not address the same aspect of Elvan's life, they are not contradictory. It is possible for Elvan to have graduated from both Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science and the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan is a politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.
Step 2: If statement 1 is true, it means that Elvan also has a degree in Political Science.
Step 3: If statement 2 is true, it means that Elvan has a degree in Civil Engineering, which is unrelated to Political Science.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements appear to be contradictory as they suggest different areas of study for Elvan.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: According to the description, it only mentions Lütfi Elvan's birthplace and his current role as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: The description does not mention Elvan's educational background.

Step 3: Statement 1 and Statement 2 provide conflicting information about Elvan's educational background. Statement 1 asserts that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science, while Statement 2 claims that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: Given that the statements are contradictory, it is not possible for both of them to be true.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: According to the description, Lütfi Elvan is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory as it is possible for Elvan to have obtained degrees from both Ankara University and Istanbul Technical University.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan is a politician who serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: The description also mentions that Elvan was born in Ladik, Samsun province, Turkey on March 12, 1962.

Step 3: Statement 1 implies that Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science, while Statement 2 implies that he graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: Since the statements refer to different fields of study, they are not necessarily contradictory. However, since the description only mentions Elvan's current position and place of birth, it is not clear which statement (if either) is true.

Conclusion: The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not necessarily contradictory, but based on the information provided in the description, it is not possible to determine which, if either, is true.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Ladik, a district in Samsun province, Turkey. Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984. He then earned a master's degree in Finance from the same university in 1986. In 1991, he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, in the United Kingdom. Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked in various positions until 2002.

Statement 1:
Between 2011 and 2013, he served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.
Step 3: The two statements cannot be contradictory because they are referring to different positions that Lütfi Elvan held at different times. Statement 1 refers to his position in a specific ministry, while statement 2 refers to his general position as an Undersecretary.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary in the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 3: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Undersecretary in some ministry, but they differ in which ministry and the time period.

Step 4: Therefore, the statements are not contradictory as they do not present conflicting information about Lütfi Elvan's role as Undersecretary. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan served as Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.
- The two statements seem to refer to the same position but with different time frames.
- If Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013 as mentioned in Statement 2, then he must have also served as Undersecretary between 2011 and 2013 as mentioned in Statement 1.
- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion:
No. The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 3: Both statements refer to Lütfi Elvan serving as Undersecretary at some point, but Statement 1 specifies the ministry he served in, while Statement 2 does not.

Step 4: Since both statements refer to different time periods and different ministries, they are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.
Step 3: Thus, statement 2 includes the time frame mentioned in statement 1, which means that Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary during the time period mentioned in statement 1.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 3: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan served as an Undersecretary, which seems to be the same position in the government.

Step 4: However, there is a discrepancy in the time period mentioned in the statements. Statement 1 says that he served as the Undersecretary between 2011 and 2013, while Statement 2 says that he worked in this position between 2006 and 2013.

Step 5: These two statements are contradictory because they cannot both be true. If Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary between 2011 and 2013 (per statement 1), he could not have held the same position between 2006 and 2013 (per statement 2).

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Analyze Statement 1 - It states that Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2 - It states that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 3: Compare the two statements - We can see that Statement 1 specifies that Lütfi Elvan was serving as the Undersecretary of a particular ministry between 2011 and 2013, whereas Statement 2 only mentions that he served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013, without specifying which ministry.

Step 4: Determine if the statements are contradictory - The two statements are not contradictory since they mention different time periods and different positions (one specifies a particular ministry, and the other does not).

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.
Step 3: When we combine the two statements, we can see that they are not contradictory. It means that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013 and also served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.
Step 4: Therefore, the answer is NO, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications between 2011 and 2013.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 3: Both statements make a different claim about Lütfi Elvan's past, but they do not necessarily contradict each other. Statement 1 specifies the period when Elvan served as an undersecretary, while statement 2 gives a broader timeframe from 2006 to 2013.

Step 4: Thus, the two statements are not contradictory and can both be true at the same time.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Read the two statements carefully.
Statement 1: Between 2011 and 2013, he served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications.
Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 2: Analyze the timeframes in the two statements.
Statement 1 states that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2011 and 2013. 
Statement 2 states that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary between 2006 and 2013.

Step 3: Compare the timeframes.
The two statements indicate that Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary for different periods of time. Statement 1 specifies that he served as Undersecretary between 2011 and 2013, while statement 2 indicates that he served in the same position from 2006 to 2013.

Step 4: Evaluate the compatibility of the two statements.
Since the two statements seem to provide different information regarding the period when Lütfi Elvan served as Undersecretary, they are incompatible.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party). 

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election. 

Step 3: Both statements mention that Elvan was elected to a political position in 2015. 

Step 4: However, statement 1 specifies that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the AK Party, while statement 2 specifies that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya. 

Step 5: These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as it is possible that Elvan was both elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly as a member of the AK Party and as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements appear to be contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 3: The 2015 general election took place on November 1, 2015, which means that Statement 1 and Statement 2 are referring to the same event.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, but they are giving slightly different details about the same event.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election.
- At first glance, these statements seem to be conflicting, because they suggest that Elvan was elected to two different positions in the same year from different constituencies or parties.
- However, it is possible that both statements are true if we consider that the Turkish Grand National Assembly is composed of Members of Parliament and that Elvan was elected from Antalya as a candidate of the AK Party.
- Therefore, both statements can be true without being contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election.

Step 5: The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the legislative body of Turkey, while the term "Member of Parliament" can refer to a member of any legislative body, including the Grand National Assembly.

Step 6: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, as they could both be true depending on the context in which "Member of Parliament" is being used.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election. 

Step 3: The statements are not necessarily contradictory as being a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and a Member of Parliament can refer to the same position in Turkey's political system. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: Based on the timeline, it is possible for both statements to be true. Elvan could have been elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Antalya in the general election and then later elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in the same year.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory as they provide different information about Lütfi Elvan's political career.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in 2015.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2011 and has continued to serve in this role.
Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in 2015.
Step 3: Both statements refer to Lütfi Elvan's position as a member of parliament, but statement 1 does not specify which province he represents.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for AKP in 2011 and continues to serve in this role.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in 2015.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962 in Ladik, Turkey. Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.

Statement 1:
He earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Statement 2:
He earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
- Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
- These two pieces of information are not contradictory because it is possible for someone to earn a higher degree from the same institution where they completed their undergraduate studies.
- Statement 2, on the other hand, says that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
- This information does not necessarily contradict the fact that he earned a master's degree from Ankara University, but it adds a new detail that suggests he may have also pursued higher education abroad.
- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, as they provide different but complementary information about Lütfi Elvan's academic background.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 claims that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986. This is possible since he could have pursued a master's degree after completing his undergraduate studies at the same university.
Step 3: Statement 2 claims that he earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States. This does not necessarily contradict the previous statement as he could have pursued a second master's degree at a different university after completing the first one.
Conclusion: The two statements are not contradictory as both could be true. So, the answer is no.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 claims that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
Step 3: Both statements mention Lütfi Elvan earning a master's degree, but Statement 1 specifically says it was from the same university as his undergraduate degree, whereas Statement 2 mentions a different university - the University of Delaware.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.

Step 2: Statement 1 states that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Step 3: There is no contradiction between the description and statement 1, as Ankara University offers master's degree programs in various fields, including political science.

Step 4: Statement 2 states that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Step 5: The description does not mention Lütfi Elvan obtaining a master's degree from the University of Delaware, and there is no indication that he obtained two master's degrees.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: According to the description, Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
Step 3: The same university referred to in Statement 1 is Ankara University, which is where Lütfi Elvan graduated from in 1984.
Step 4: Therefore, Statement 1 is consistent with the information provided in the description.
Step 5: Statement 2 says that he earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
Step 6: The description does not mention Lütfi Elvan earning a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware.
Step 7: Therefore, Statement 2 contradicts the information provided in the description.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
Step 3: If statement 1 is true, then Lütfi Elvan must have continued his education at Ankara University after graduating in 1984.
Step 4: However, if statement 2 is true, then Lütfi Elvan would have earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States, not from Ankara University.
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true as they present conflicting information about Lütfi Elvan's education.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986, which is plausible.
Step 3: Statement 2 says that he earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States, which is not mentioned in the description.
Step 4: Therefore, statement 2 contradicts the description.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
- Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
- These two pieces of information are consistent and compatible. It is common for graduates to pursue further education at the same university.
- Statement 2 says that he earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
- This information seems to contradict the first statement, as it suggests that Lütfi Elvan studied abroad for his master's degree instead of attending Ankara University.
- However, the description only mentions Lütfi Elvan's undergraduate degree from Ankara University, and does not rule out the possibility of him earning another degree from a different institution before or after his postgraduate studies at Ankara University.
- Therefore, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory. It is possible for both to be true, depending on the timeline of Lütfi Elvan's academic career.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not necessarily contradictory.
A: 1. According to the description, Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
2. The second statement claims that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
3. These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other as Lütfi Elvan could have earned two different master's degrees from two different universities.
4. Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The initial description mentions that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.

Step 2: Statement 1 adds that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Step 3: Therefore, both Step 1 and Step 2 confirm that Lütfi Elvan earned a degree from Ankara University, but the latter specifies that it was a master's degree.

Step 4: Statement 2 contradicts the initial description because it claims that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States, which is different from the university mentioned in the initial description.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The first statement establishes that Lütfi Elvan is both an economist and a politician.
- The second statement adds more specific information, stating that he is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.
- Statement 2 says Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
- These two statements are not necessarily contradictory because the Turkish Grand National Assembly is also known as the Turkish Parliament, which consists of 600 members elected by popular vote for a term of five years.
- Therefore, both statements could be referring to the same election and the same position, just using different names.
- It's also possible that Elvan was elected to both positions, but the statements don't explicitly state this.
- Based on this reasoning, the answer is NO, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
Step 3: The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the parliament of Turkey, and its members are also referred to as Members of Parliament.
Step 4: Therefore, both statements essentially say the same thing, just using different language.
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Determine if being a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly is the same as being a Member of Parliament.

Step 2: Research if the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey allows for holding a seat in the Turkish Grand National Assembly.

Step 3: Check if Karaman is the province that Elvan represents in the Turkish Grand National Assembly.

Step 4: Analyze both statements and see if they exclude each other or if they can both be true.

Step 1: According to Turkey's political system, the Turkish Grand National Assembly is the unicameral parliament of Turkey. Therefore, being a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly is the same as being a Member of Parliament.

Step 2: The Constitution of Turkey allows ministers to be members of parliament, but they cannot vote or participate in parliamentary activities when they are in charge of a ministry. Therefore, it is possible for Elvan to be a minister and a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly at the same time, but he would be unable to participate in parliamentary activities while serving as Minister of Treasury and Finance.

Step 3: There is no mention of the province of Karaman in the description of Elvan's background or positions held. Therefore, it cannot be determined if Elvan represents Karaman in the Turkish Grand National Assembly or not.

Step 4: The two statements do not exclude each other. Elvan could have been elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015, and he could have been elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the same election. Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: The Turkish Grand National Assembly refers to the unicameral parliament of Turkey. Hence, Statement 1 also implies that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament in 2015.

Step 4: Both statements indicate that Elvan was elected to the Turkish parliament in 2015, but they mention different titles for the position he held. While Statement 1 says he was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Statement 2 specifies that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory. They are both true and complement each other, providing different details about the same event.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.
- Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
- The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the parliament of Turkey, consisting of 600 members.
- Therefore, if Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, he would automatically be a Member of Parliament.
- However, Statement 2 only mentions Elvan's election for the specific province of Karaman, which could imply that he was not elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
- Therefore, the two statements could be contradictory.

Conclusion:
Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan could be contradictory as Statement 1 implies that he was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while Statement 2 suggests that he was only elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015. 
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election. 
Step 3: Both statements indicate that Elvan had some form of political role in 2015. 
Step 4: However, it is important to note that the Turkish Grand National Assembly consists of both the Senate (upper house) and the National Assembly (lower house), while the title "Member of Parliament" typically refers to the National Assembly. 
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory, but they do use different terminology to refer to Elvan's political position. 
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
Step 3: Both statements are referring to the same event - Elvan's election in 2015.
Step 4: The difference between the two statements is in the specific position that Elvan was elected to - the Turkish Grand National Assembly in Statement 1, and the role of Member of Parliament for Karaman in Statement 2.
Step 5: However, these positions are not contradictory, as the Turkish Grand National Assembly is made up of Members of Parliament from various provinces and parties.
Step 6: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.
2. Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
3. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the parliament of Turkey, consisting of 600 members elected by the people for a term of five years.
4. Therefore, it is possible that Elvan was elected both as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election, as these are not necessarily contradictory.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory as it is possible for Elvan to be elected both as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.

Step 2:
Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3:
The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the unicameral parliament of Turkey, which means that being a member of it means being a member of parliament.

Step 4:
Therefore, the two statements are saying essentially the same thing, just using slightly different language.

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
Step 3: The Turkish Grand National Assembly and the Turkish Parliament are the same thing. 
Step 4: Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 are saying the same thing. 
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.

Step 3: From the two statements, it can be concluded that both statements are not contradictory. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Identify the two statements about Lütfi Elvan.
Statement 1: During his tenure as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Marmaray tunnel, the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, and the Istanbul Airport.
Statement 2: As the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, Lütfi Elvan oversaw the construction of the Marmaray tunnel, which connects the European and Asian sides of Istanbul via a railway tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait.

Step 2: Compare the two statements.
Statement 1 mentions that Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects during his tenure as Minister of Transport, whereas Statement 2 specifically mentions his oversight of the construction of the Marmaray tunnel.

Step 3: Determine if the statements are contradictory.
No, the two statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 is more general and highlights Elvan's involvement in multiple infrastructure projects, while Statement 2 is a specific example of one of those projects that Elvan oversaw.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan oversaw the construction of several major infrastructure projects during his tenure as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, including the Marmaray tunnel.

Step 2: Statement 2 specifically mentions that Elvan oversaw the construction of the Marmaray tunnel during his tenure as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications.

Step 3: Since both statements mention Elvan's oversight of the construction of the Marmaray tunnel during his tenure as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, they are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
Statement 1 mentions that Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Marmaray tunnel, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, and Istanbul Airport.
Statement 2 specifically highlights the Marmaray tunnel project, which Elvan oversaw as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications.
Both statements mention Elvan's role as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and both mention the Marmaray tunnel project.
Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Reading both statements
Statement 1: During his tenure as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Marmaray tunnel, the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, and the Istanbul Airport.
Statement 2: As the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, Lütfi Elvan oversaw the construction of the Marmaray tunnel, which connects the European and Asian sides of Istanbul via a railway tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait.

Step 2: Analyzing the statements
Statement 1 mentions that Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects while he was the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications, including the Marmaray tunnel. 
Statement 2 specifies that Elvan oversaw the construction of the Marmaray tunnel as a part of his duties as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications.

Step 3: Drawing a conclusion
Both statements are consistent with each other. 

Conclusion: No
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

Statement 1 mentions that Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects including the Marmaray tunnel, while Statement 2 specifically mentions that Elvan oversaw the construction of the Marmaray tunnel. However, these statements are not necessarily contradictory because Statement 2 could be seen as providing more detail about one of the projects mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan oversaw several major infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Marmaray tunnel, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, and Istanbul Airport.

Step 2: Statement 2 specifically mentions that as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, Elvan oversaw the construction of the Marmaray tunnel.

Step 3: While there is some overlap between the two statements, they are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions several infrastructure projects overseen by Elvan, while Statement 2 specifically highlights one of those projects (the Marmaray tunnel).

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.

Step 2: The second statement mentions that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Conclusion: No
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The description says that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.
- Statement 1 adds that he then earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
- Statement 2, however, shifts the focus to a different university, the University of Delaware in the United States and claims that he earned a master's degree in economics from there.

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for Lütfi Elvan to graduate from Ankara University and also earn a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware.
A: Reasoning:
- The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.
- Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
- Statement 2 says that he earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory. The description and Statement 1 both mention that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree, but Statement 1 provides additional details on when and where he obtained it. Statement 2, on the other hand, refers to a different degree he earned in a different university and subject area.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.
Step 2: Statement 1 indicates that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.
Step 3: The two statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other.

A: Step 1: The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Elvan earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Step 3: Therefore, Statement 1 is consistent with the information provided in the description.

Step 4: However, Statement 2 says that Elvan earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Step 5: This information is not provided in the description, and therefore, there is a possibility that it may be contradictory.

Step 6: However, it is also possible that Elvan earned a master's degree in both Ankara University and the University of Delaware.

Conclusion: Based on the above reasoning, we cannot definitely conclude whether the two statements are contradictory or not. It is possible that Statement 2 is consistent with the information that is not provided in the description.
A: Step 1: The first statement mentions that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University.

Step 2: The second statement mentions that he earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware.

Step 3: The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other because it is possible for Lütfi Elvan to have earned multiple master's degrees from different universities.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that he earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Step 4: Since Statement 1 and the description both mention Ankara University, they are consistent.

Step 5: Statement 2, however, mentions a completely different institution (University of Delaware) than the one mentioned in the description, and therefore contradicts the description.

Conclusion: The two statements are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science. 
Step 2: Statement 1 says that he then earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Conclusion: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory because it is possible for Lütfi Elvan to have earned two master's degrees from different universities at different times. Therefore, the answer is no.
A: Step 1: The initial description mentions that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science.
Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that he earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986. 
Step 3: This indicates that the master's degree mentioned in statement 1 is in addition to his undergraduate degree from Ankara University. 
Step 4: Statement 2, on the other hand, mentions that he earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States. 
Step 5: There is no contradiction between the two statements. Statement 1 refers to a master's degree earned from Ankara University, while statement 2 refers to a different master's degree earned from the University of Delaware. 
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 2: The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan is a skilled economist and a key figure in Turkey's economic development.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 suggests that Elvan is a potential contender for the AKP's leadership, which implies that he has a strong political influence within the party.

Step 3: Both statements acknowledge Elvan's key role in Turkey's politics and economic development, but they emphasize different aspects of his career. Statement 1 is more focused on his political influence, while Statement 2 is more focused on his expertise in economics and policy-making. 

Conclusion: Based on the above analysis, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 highlights Elvan's potential leadership role in the AKP, while Statement 2 emphasizes his expertise in economics and contribution to Turkey's economic development.

Step 2: The two statements do not directly contradict each other, as they focus on different aspects of Elvan's career and abilities.

Step 3: Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 describes Elvan as a potential contender for the AKP party leadership, which suggests that he holds significant political influence within the party.

Step 2: Statement 2 describes Elvan as a skilled economist and a key figure in Turkey's economic development, which suggests that he holds significant expertise in economic matters.

Step 3: There is nothing in either statement that contradicts the other. In fact, they complement each other, as Elvan's position as a skilled economist and key figure in economic development would likely contribute to his reputation as a potential party leader.

Step 2: Statement 2 describes Elvan as a skilled economist and a key figure in Turkey's economic development.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan is seen as a potential contender for the AKP's leadership, while Statement 2 highlights his expertise in economics and role in Turkey's economic development.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Ladik, a district in Samsun province, Turkey. Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984. He then earned a master's degree in Finance from the same university in 1986. In 1991, he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, in the United Kingdom. Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked in various positions until 2002. Between 2011 and 2013, he served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications. He was then appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, a position he held until 2015.

Statement 1:
In November 2015, Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2015 general elections.
Step 3: Both statements talk about Elvan's election but in different contexts (assembly versus general elections).
Step 4: The statements do not say anything contradictory about Elvan.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
Step 2: Both statements mention that he was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
Step 3: There is no conflicting information between the two statements.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015. 
Step 2: Statement 2 also mentions that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP), but it doesn't specify the exact time.
Step 3: Since both statements mention that Elvan was elected from the AKP, they are not contradictory. 
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the AK Party in November 2015.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected from the AKP in the 2015 general elections. However, it doesn't specify when in 2015 he was elected, so it could be interpreted as either before or after November.
- If Statement 2 means that Elvan was elected before November 2015, then it doesn't contradict Statement 1.
- If Statement 2 means that Elvan was elected in November 2015 or later, then it would contradict Statement 1, since Elvan couldn't have been both in the government as Minister of Treasury and Finance and in the parliament as an AKP MP at the same time.

Conclusion: Without further clarification about the timing of Elvan's election in Statement 2, we cannot definitively say whether the two statements about him are contradictory or not. However, if we assume that Statement 2 refers to Elvan's election before November 2015, then the statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Statement 2 also mentions that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP), but it does not give a specific date or election.

Since both statements mention that Elvan was elected from the AK/AKP, they do not contradict each other.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: Both statements mention that Elvan was elected to a political position in 2015 from the same political party (AK Party/AKP).

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
Step 2: Both statements mention that the election took place in 2015.
Step 3: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015. 

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: Both statements mention Elvan's election in 2015, but statement 1 specifies the position he was elected to (member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly) while statement 2 specifies the party he was elected from (AKP). 

Step 4: Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, as both provide different but complementary information about Elvan's election in 2015. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The first statement mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: The second statement also mentions that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: Both statements mention that Elvan was elected in 2015 and belong to the same political party (AK Party/AKP).

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory but reinforce each other.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: Both statements mention that Elvan was elected in 2015, but statement 1 specifies the month of the election and the position he was elected to, while statement 2 only mentions the year and the political party.

Step 4: The use of "AK Party" in statement 1 and "AKP" in statement 2 may give the impression that they are referring to different political entities, but they are actually different spellings of the same Turkish political party: the Justice and Development Party.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who has been serving as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020. He previously held various positions in the government, including Minister of Development, Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission. Elvan was born in Nazilli, Aydın in 1962 and studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara. He later obtained his Master's degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. Elvan began his political career in 2002 when he was elected as a Member of Parliament from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in the Aydin constituency.

Statement 1:
He served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

Step 3: The two statements do not seem to directly contradict each other, as they refer to different periods in Lütfi Elvan's career. Statement 1 refers to a period before 2011, while Statement 2 refers to a period after 2013.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.
- These two statements do not seem to contradict each other on their own, as they refer to different periods of Elvan's career: Statement 1 covers the years 2004 to 2011, while Statement 2 starts from 2013.
- However, there is a missing piece of information about what Elvan did between 2011 and 2013, which could potentially reveal a contradiction. It is possible that Elvan held another position during those years that conflicts with either Statement 1 or Statement 2.
- Without knowing what happened during that two-year period, we cannot determine if the two statements are contradictory or not.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.
- These two statements are not contradictory, as they refer to different periods of Elvan's political career. Statement 1 covers the period from 2004 to 2011, while Statement 2 covers the period from 2013 onwards.
- Therefore, it is possible for both statements to be true without contradicting each other.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

Step 3: Both statements mention different positions that Lütfi Elvan held at different times in his political career.

Step 4: There is no direct contradiction between the two statements as they do not mention the same position and time period for Lütfi Elvan.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement mentions that Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.

Step 2: The second statement mentions that Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

Step 3: There is nothing in either of the statements that suggests a contradiction between them. They both provide information about Lütfi Elvan's political career, but they focus on different roles he held at different times.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 indicates that from 2004 to 2011, Lütfi Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch. 

Step 2: 
Statement 2 indicates that Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013. 

Step 3: 
There is no direct contradiction between the two statements. Statement 1 refers to an earlier period in Lütfi Elvan's political career (2004-2011), while Statement 2 refers to a later period (until 2013). 

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

Statement 1: He served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.
Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

From the description, it is clear that Lütfi Elvan held different positions in the government, including Minister of Development, Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission. However, there is no mention of him serving as Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch in the description.

Therefore, statement 1 is not supported by the description and may not be accurate.

On the other hand, statement 2 is accurate based on the description. Lütfi Elvan did serve as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission before being appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

Conclusion:

No, the two statements are not contradictory, but statement 1 is not supported by the information provided in the description.
A: Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.
- Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.
- Since Statement 1 and Statement 2 refer to different periods of time, they do not directly contradict each other.
- However, if we consider the timeline of Elvan's career as mentioned in the initial description, Statement 1 overlaps with his early career as a Member of Parliament from 2002 and Statement 2 overlaps with his later career as a Minister starting from 2013.
- Therefore, there might be some confusion or discrepancy regarding the timeline of Elvan's roles, but the two statements themselves are not contradictory.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011.

Step 3: There is no direct contradiction between the two statements. Statement 1 mentions a previous position held by Lütfi Elvan, while Statement 2 mentions a subsequent position held by him. There is no conflicting information between the two statements.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1:
Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as the Chairman of the AK Party's Aydin Provincial Branch from 2004 to 2011. 

Step 2:
Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission until he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications in 2013.

1. Statement 1 says that Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for AKP, while Statement 2 says he began as a member of AKP in 2011.

- Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan is seen as a potential contender for the AKP's leadership.

The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other. While Elvan may have the potential to become a leader within the AKP, he can still maintain a close relationship with Erdogan. Therefore, the answer is no.

A: Step 1: 

Statement 1 says Lütfi Elvan is the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.

Step 2: 

Statement 2 says Lütfi Elvan is the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey since November 2020.

Step 3:

A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan is serving as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.

Step 2: 
Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan is serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey since November 2020.

Both statements refer to Lütfi Elvan being a minister in the Turkish government since November 2020, but they are referring to different ministerial positions - Minister of Trade in Statement 1 and Minister of Treasury and Finance in Statement 2.

Conclusion: 
Therefore, the two statements are contradictory because they refer to different ministerial positions held by Lütfi Elvan.
A: 1. The first statement describes Lütfi Elvan as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.
2. The second statement describes Lütfi Elvan as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey since November 2020.
3. The titles of the two ministerial positions are different.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 describes Lütfi Elvan as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.

Step 2:
Statement 2, on the other hand, describes Lütfi Elvan as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey since November 2020.

Step 3:
Since both statements mention Lütfi Elvan as a minister in Turkey, it is possible that they are talking about the same person.

Step 4:
However, since they describe Lütfi Elvan's ministerial role differently, the two statements appear to be contradictory.

Conclusion: 
Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The beginning of the description states that Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who has been serving as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.

Step 4: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan has been serving as a minister in the Turkish government since November 2020, but they differ in the specific ministry he is serving in.

Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are contradictory in terms of the specific ministry that Lütfi Elvan is serving in, but they both agree that he is a minister in the Turkish government.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: 1. The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan is serving as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.
2. The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan has been serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey since November 2020.
3. These are two different ministerial positions.
4. Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

The two statements give different positions held by Lütfi Elvan.

Step 2: 
However, both statements indicate that Lütfi Elvan has been serving as a minister in Turkey since November 2020.

Since there are multiple ministerial positions in the Turkish government, there is a possibility that Lütfi Elvan could have held different positions at different times.

A: Reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan is the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan is the Minister of Treasury and Finance of Turkey since November 2020.

Step 3: Compare the main ideas in the two statements.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish economist and politician. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Nazilli, Turkey. He studied at Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science before receiving a master's degree in economic planning from the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and later served as the deputy chairman of the party's Ankara branch. In 2011, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and has continued to serve in this role. Elvan has held several prominent positions in the Turkish government, including serving as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Statement 1:
He was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.

Statement 2:
He was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: Look at the description to see if it mentions whether Lütfi Elvan has been appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure or the Minister of Finance and Treasury.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that he was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020. The description only mentions that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015, but it does not mention anything about him being appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.

Step 3: Statement 2 claims that he was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020. Again, the description does not mention anything about him being appointed to this position.

Conclusion: The two statements are contradictory, as they make different claims about Lütfi Elvan's recent appointments within the Turkish government.
A: Step 1: Summarize the timeline of Lütfi Elvan's career based on the description.
- He began his political career as an economic expert for the AKP.
- In 2011, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP.
- From 2013 to 2015, he served as the Minister of Development.
- In 2020, he was appointed as a minister.

Step 2: Examine statement 1.
- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
- The description does not mention Elvan's appointment as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure.
- However, the timeline in the description does suggest that Elvan may have been appointed to another ministerial position after serving as the Minister of Development.

Step 3: Examine statement 2.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.
- This contradicts statement 1 that says Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
- The description also does not mention Elvan's appointment as the Minister of Finance and Treasury.

Conclusion: The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
- Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.
- The statements seem to suggest that Lütfi Elvan held two different ministerial positions in 2020, which could indicate a contradiction.
- However, it is possible that Lütfi Elvan first served as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure before being transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury later in the same year.
- Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine whether the two statements are contradictory without additional information.

Conclusion: No
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.
Step 3: Both statements indicate that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as a minister in 2020.
Step 4: However, the ministries stated in the two statements are different.
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The two statements seem contradictory as they suggest that Lütfi Elvan was appointed to two different ministerial positions in the same year.
Step 2: On closer inspection, however, statement 1 does not mention the year in which Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure. It is possible that this appointment was made in a year other than 2020.
Step 3: Statement 2, on the other hand, explicitly mentions that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.
Conclusion: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory. Statement 2 is true and refers to Elvan's current position, while statement 1 is uncertain as it does not provide a specific year for Elvan's supposed appointment.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020. 
Step 3: Statement 2 includes a more specific time frame (November 2020) than Statement 1. 
Step 4: It is possible that Statement 1 refers to an earlier time in 2020 before Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November.
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.
- Both statements refer to appointments of Lütfi Elvan to ministerial positions in the Turkish government.
- However, the positions mentioned in the two statements are different: the first statement refers to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, while the second statement refers to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury.
- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, but complementary.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.

Step 3: Both statements indicate that Lütfi Elvan was appointed to a ministerial position in the Turkish government in 2020.

Step 4: However, the statements differ about which specific ministerial position he was appointed to. Statement 1 says he was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, while Statement 2 says he was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory as they provide different information about his ministerial appointment in 2020.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.
- Since both statements refer to appointments in 2020 and mention different ministerial positions, it is possible that they are not contradictory if Lütfi Elvan was appointed to one position first and then to the other later in the year.
- However, the information in the description only mentions Lütfi Elvan's previous position as the Minister of Development until 2015 and does not provide any indication of subsequent ministerial appointments until 2020.
- It is unclear from the given information whether Lütfi Elvan was appointed to both ministerial positions in 2020 or if one of the statements is incorrect.

Conclusion: Based on the given information, it is inconclusive whether the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory or not.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure in 2020.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Treasury in November 2020.

Step 3: The two statements seem to be contradictory because they suggest that Lütfi Elvan was appointed to two different ministerial positions in the same year - one as the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure and the other as the Minister of Finance and Treasury.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962 in Ladik, Turkey. Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984. He earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Statement 1:
Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan obtained his PhD in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: The description only mentions Lütfi Elvan's educational background up until his master's degree from Ankara University.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter.
Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.
Step 4: Since the description only mentions Lütfi Elvan's educational background up until his master's degree from Ankara University, and the two statements provide conflicting information about Lütfi Elvan's Ph.D., it is not clear which statement is true, or if both are false.
Conclusion: The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are potentially contradictory, as they provide conflicting information about his Ph.D. in economics.
A: Step 1: According to the description, Lütfi Elvan earned a Master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, but it does not mention when he obtained it.

Step 3: Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991, but it does not specify whether it was after he earned his Master's degree from the same university.

Step 4: Putting the information from the description and the two statements together, we know that Lütfi Elvan earned a Master's degree from Ankara University in 1986, but there is no mention of when or where he obtained his Ph.D. in economics.

Conclusion: The two statements are not contradictory as they do not provide enough information to confirm or deny whether Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter or Ankara University.
A: Step 1: According to the description, it is mentioned that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter. There is no mention of any prior Ph.D. obtained by Lütfi Elvan.

Step 3: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991. This contradicts statement 1 as it mentions a different university and a different year for the Ph.D. obtained.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 2: Statement 1 states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter. There is no information in the description about him obtaining a Ph.D. from the University of Exeter.
Step 3: Statement 2 states that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991. This statement mentions him obtaining a Ph.D. but contradicts statement 1 about the location of his Ph.D. program.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
- Statement 1 implies that he continued his studies and obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, which is a different institution from Ankara University.
- Statement 2 implies that he obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991, which is consistent with the fact that he already had a master's degree from that university.

Conclusion: 

The two statements are contradictory. Statement 1 implies that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Exeter, while Statement 2 implies that he obtained it from Ankara University. Therefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time.
A: Step 1: The original description states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter.
Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his PhD in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, which is different from the information provided in the description.

Step 3: Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991, which is also different from the information provided in the description.

Step 4: Since the two statements have conflicting information about where Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from, they are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his PhD in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 4: Since Statement 1 says that he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Exeter, and the description and Statement 2 say that he obtained it from Ankara University, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The original description states that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter. 
Step 3: Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.
Step 4: Since both statements claim that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics, the only way they can both be true is if he obtained two separate Ph.D.s. Therefore, they are not contradictory.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Ladik, a district in Samsun province, Turkey. Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984. He then earned a master's degree in Finance from the same university in 1986. In 1991, he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, in the United Kingdom.

Statement 1:
Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked in various positions until 2002.

Statement 2:
Before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance, Lütfi Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance from 1986 to 2002.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.

Step 3: By comparing the two statements, we can conclude that they are not contradictory, as both statements establish that Elvan has extensive experience working in the Ministry of Finance.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: 1. Statement 1 says "Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked in various positions until 2002." 
2. Statement 2 says "Before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance, Lütfi Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years."

Step 1: Both statements mention that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
Step 2: Statement 1 specifies that Elvan worked in various positions until 2002.
Step 3: Statement 2 only mentions that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years but does not specify the duration or the positions he held.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides more specific information about the duration and variety of Elvan's work experience in the Ministry of Finance, while Statement 2 simply acknowledges that he had prior experience in the ministry.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance until 2002.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
- These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other. It is possible for someone to work in an organization for many years and then leave, only to join back later in a different position.
- Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance until 2002.
- Statement 2 says Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
- Therefore, Statement 2 implies that Elvan also worked in the Ministry of Finance after 2002.

Conclusion:
The two statements are not contradictory, as Statement 1 only gives a specific timeframe for Elvan's work in the Ministry of Finance, while Statement 2 provides a more general statement about his overall career path.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance until 2002.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
Step 3: Combining both statements, it can be concluded that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years, including until 2002.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance until 2002.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years.
Step 3: We can infer from the two statements that Elvan did work in the Ministry of Finance for many years, including up until 2002.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance until 2002.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
- From the description, we know that Elvan earned a Ph.D. in economics in 1991, which implies that he continued his education beyond 1986.
- Therefore, it is possible for Elvan to have worked in the Ministry of Finance before and after 2002, while also continuing his education in between.
- The statements do not explicitly contradict each other, as they both mention Elvan's work experience in the Ministry of Finance.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan worked for the Ministry of Finance from 1986 to 2002.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan worked for the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming Minister of Treasury and Finance.
- These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as "many years" can include the period from 1986 to 2002 mentioned in Statement 1.
- However, without further information, we cannot know for sure if Statement 2 refers to the same time period as Statement 1 or a longer period that includes Statement 1.
- Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but they may not be completely consistent in their scope.

Conclusion:
No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance from 1986 until 2002.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
Step 3: These statements are not contradictory because both statements acknowledge that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for a significant amount of time. Statement 1 gives a specific time frame, while Statement 2 is more general. 
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance from 1986 to 2002.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years before becoming the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
Step 3: Both statements agree that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance.
Step 4: The only difference is the duration mentioned in the two statements. 
Step 5: Statement 1 is more specific about the years, mentioning 1986 to 2002. 
Step 6: Statement 2 is more vague, only stating that Elvan worked in the Ministry of Finance for many years, before his current position.
Step 7: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, but rather provide different levels of detail about Elvan's previous work experience. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the AK Party.
2. Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in March 2021 from the AKP in Istanbul.
3. The two statements refer to different elections (2015 vs. 2021) and different positions (National Assembly vs. parliament).

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 2: Statement 2 states that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the month of March 2021 from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the province of Istanbul.

Step 3: Both statements mention that Elvan is a member of the ruling AK Party.

Step 4: However, Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while Statement 2 mentions that he was elected to the parliament in the province of Istanbul.

Conclusion: The two statements are not contradictory as they refer to different positions that Elvan was elected to. Therefore, the answer is no.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament from the ruling Justice and Development Party in the province of Istanbul in March 2021.
Step 3: The two statements are not contradictory as they both mention Elvan being elected as a member of parliament from the Justice and Development Party.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in March 2021 from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the province of Istanbul.

Conclusion: The two statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 refers to Elvan's election to the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015, while Statement 2 refers to his election as a member of parliament in 2021 from the province of Istanbul. They are both consistent with his political career, and therefore, the answer is no.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the province of Istanbul in March 2021.

The statements do not explicitly contradict each other as they both refer to Elvan being elected to political positions in Turkey. However, they do appear to describe different events as they mention different elected positions and years. 

Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 indicates that Elvan was already a member of the AK Party in November 2015, which means he had been a member before this time.
- Statement 2 states that Elvan was elected as an MP in March 2021, which means he was not an MP before this time.
- However, being a member of a party does not necessarily mean holding a specific position, such as being an MP or a minister. Therefore, there could be a logical sequence where Elvan was a party member, then became a minister, then was not an MP, and then became an MP again in a different election. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory because they refer to different periods and roles of Elvan's political career.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the AK Party in November 2015.

Step 2: 
Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament from the ruling AKP in Istanbul in March 2021.

Step 3: 
There is no mention of Elvan losing his previous position as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in Statement 2. Therefore, it is possible that he held both positions at different times.

Step 4:
Based on the information provided, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: 
No, the statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015.
- Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in March 2021, representing the Justice and Development Party in Istanbul.
- The two statements refer to different elections in different years for different positions.
- Therefore, the statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the AKP in November 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 also mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament from the AKP, but in March 2021 and in the province of Istanbul.
Step 3: The two statements are not contradictory as they describe different elections in different years and in different locations.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: 
Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the province of Istanbul in March 2021.

Step 3: 
Both statements mention that Elvan is a member of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party/AKP) and that he was elected to a political position in Turkey. 

Step 4: 
However, Statement 1 refers to Elvan's 2015 election to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, whereas Statement 2 refers to his 2021 election to parliament in Istanbul. 

Step 5: 
Therefore, the two statements do not appear to be contradictory as they refer to two different elections and political positions held by Elvan at different times.

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: 

Compare the two statements for any differences.

Step 2:

The two statements are identical in meaning but differ only in the choice of words.

Step 3:

Both statements convey the same information on Lütfi Elvan and his current position in Turkey's Ministry of Treasury and Finance.

Step 4:

Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, affirming that Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician and currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Conclusion: 

No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory, as both affirm his political status and position in Turkey's government.
A: Step 1: Compare the two statements.
Step 2: Notice that the only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the phrase "who" in the first statement.
Step 3: Consider the meaning of the phrase "who" in the first statement. It is used as a relative pronoun to introduce a dependent clause that provides additional information about Lütfi Elvan.
Step 4: Evaluate whether the difference in wording has any effect on the overall meaning of the statements. 
Step 5: Determine that the two statements are equivalent in meaning and do not contradict each other.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Both statements provide the same information about Lütfi Elvan being a Turkish politician and currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: 
The wording of the two statements is slightly different. Statement 1 starts with "Lütfi Elvan is" while Statement 2 starts with "Lütfi Elvan, a Turkish politician, currently serves as." 

Step 3: 
There is no contradiction between the two statements as they both convey the same information about Lütfi Elvan's current political position.

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician.
Step 2: Both statements mention that he is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

A: Step 1: 
Compare the two statements word by word.

Step 2:
Identify any differences in wording.

Step 3:
Analyze if the differences change the meaning or contradict each other.

Step 1: 
The two statements are almost identical, with the only difference being the order of the words in the sentence.

Step 2:
The only difference between the two statements is the placement of the comma and the phrase "a Turkish politician."

Step 3:
The difference in the wording does not change the meaning or contradict one another. Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Both statements start by introducing Lütfi Elvan as a Turkish politician who serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. 

Step 2: 
Statement 1 adds the word "who" before "currently", suggesting that his position as Minister of Treasury and Finance is the defining feature of his current political role.

Step 3: 
Statement 2 uses a comma to separate the identifying information from Elvan's current role, suggesting that his current position as Minister of Treasury and Finance is just one of several things that could be said about him.

Step 4: 
There is a difference in emphasis between the two statements, but they are not contradictory. Statement 1 simply emphasizes Elvan's current role as Minister of Treasury and Finance, while Statement 2 leaves open the possibility of discussing other aspects of his political career or personal life. 

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Analyze the two statements.

Statement 1:
"Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey."

Statement 2:
"Lütfi Elvan, a Turkish politician, currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey."

Step 2: Compare the two statements.

The only difference between the two statements is the addition of the phrase "who" in Statement 1. The rest of the statements are identical.

Step 3: Determine if the difference changes the meaning.

Adding the phrase "who" in Statement 1 does not change the meaning of the sentence in any significant way. Both statements still convey the same information.

Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

The two statements are not contradictory. They are essentially identical copies of each other with a minor difference in wording that does not change the meaning at all. Therefore, the answer is no.
A: 1. Both statements begin with "Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician."
2. Both statements state that he is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Both statements introduce Lütfi Elvan as a Turkish politician who serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

No, the statements are not contradictory. They both convey the same information about Lütfi Elvan's occupation and position in the government.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Step 3: Determine if the statements are contradictory.
Since the two statements have no significant differences and describe the same person and position, they are not contradictory.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in the year 2015.

Step 4: Both statements affirm that Elvan was elected to a parliamentary position in 2015.

Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in the year 2015.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015 from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 5: Therefore, statement 1 is consistent with the information in the description as it states that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in 2015, which is before he became the Minister of Treasury and Finance.
Step 6: In contrast, statement 2 is incorrect as it overlaps with statement 1 and repeats the same information with additional details about the constituency Elvan was elected from.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the AK Party in November 2015.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for Ankara in the year 2015.

- It's possible that these titles refer to the same position, but using different names or translations. However, it's also possible that they refer to different positions within the Turkish parliamentary system.

Conclusion: It's unclear whether the two statements are contradictory since they use different titles for the same or different positions. Therefore, the answer is neither yes nor no.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in 2015.
Step 3: Both statements mention that Elvan was elected to a political position in 2015.
Step 4: However, there is a difference in the positions mentioned in the two statements. Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while Statement 2 mentions that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Ankara.
Step 5: The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the unicameral legislative body of Turkey, while the Ankara parliament is the local legislative body for the province of Ankara.
Step 6: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, but rather refer to different political positions held by Elvan in 2015. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in 2015.

Step 4: There is no direct contradiction between the two statements, as they both mention different aspects of Elvan's legislative career in Turkey.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in the year 2015.

Step 4: However, statement 1 specifies that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while statement 2 specifies that he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara.

Step 5: The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the unicameral parliament of Turkey, so being elected to it would mean being a member of parliament. However, it is possible that statement 2 could be referring to a different type of parliamentary position such as a local or regional parliament.

Conclusion: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory, as they can both be true depending on the interpretation of statement 2.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 4: Since Lütfi Elvan held a ministerial position until 2015, it is unlikely that he would have been elected as a Member of Parliament or the Turkish Grand National Assembly before completing his term as minister.

Step 5: Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 cannot both be true.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory. Specifically, statement 2 is false as Lütfi Elvan was not elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in 2015.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1: In November 2015, Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
- Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Ankara in the year 2015.
- Both statements mention Elvan being elected to a political position in 2015.
- However, statement 1 specifies that he was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while statement 2 does not specify the authority where he was elected.
- There is a possibility that the two statements are referring to the same political entity, but it is not explicitly stated.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory, but they refer to different political entities without specifying if they are the same or not.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish economist and politician. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Nazilli, Turkey. He studied at Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science before receiving a master's degree in economic planning from the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and later served as the deputy chairman of the party's Ankara branch. In 2011, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and has continued to serve in this role.

Statement 1:
Elvan has held several prominent positions in the Turkish government, including serving as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.
Step 3: Neither statement directly contradicts the other, as they refer to different time periods and positions held by Elvan in the Turkish government.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.
Step 3: There is no mention in either statement about Elvan holding these positions at the same time or during overlapping periods.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory. They simply give different information about the various positions that Elvan has held in the Turkish government.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.
Step 3: There is no mention in either statement about these positions being held during the same time period or if they were held at different times in Elvan's career.
Step 4: Therefore, it is possible that Elvan held the position of Minister of Development in addition to the positions mentioned in statement 2, OR he held only one of those positions during a specific time period.
Step 5: Since the statements do not provide conflicting information, they are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

Statement 1: Elvan has held several prominent positions in the Turkish government, including serving as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.

From the given information, it is clear that Statement 1 refers to Elvan's position as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015. However, Statement 2 mentions two different positions - the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury. 

Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory as Statement 1 does not mention the other positions Elvan held in the government. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.
Step 3: The two statements do not directly contradict each other. It is possible for Elvan to have served as the Minister of Development during 2013-2015, and then held other ministerial positions at a later time.
Step 4: Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 mentions that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
- Statement 2 mentions that Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.
- There is no mention in statement 1 about Elvan holding any other ministerial positions in the government.
- Therefore, statement 2 provides additional information about Elvan's ministerial experience beyond what is stated in statement 1.
- The two statements do not contradict each other.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan served as Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan held positions as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and Minister of Finance and Treasury in Turkish government.

Conclusion: The two statements are not contradictory. Statement 2 provides additional information about other positions that Elvan held in Turkish government, while statement 1 focuses on his role as Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.

Step 3: The two statements do not explicitly contradict each other, but they also do not necessarily confirm each other either. It is possible that Elvan served as the Minister of Development and also held other ministerial positions at different times. However, without more information, we cannot definitively say whether or not the two statements contradict each other.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not necessarily contradictory, but we cannot confirm their accuracy without further information.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan held positions as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and the Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government.
- If Elvan was the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015, then he could not have held the two other ministerial positions mentioned in Statement 2 during that same time period.
- However, it is possible that Elvan held those two other ministerial positions at a different time, either before or after his term as Minister of Development.
- Therefore, the two statements are not inherently contradictory, but they may be incomplete or require further context to fully understand Elvan's career trajectory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory, but they may be incomplete or require further context to fully understand Elvan's career trajectory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 mentions that Elvan served as Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
- Statement 2 mentions that Elvan held positions as Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and Minister of Finance and Treasury in the Turkish government, but it does not specify the timeframe of these positions.
- It is possible that Elvan held these various positions at different times, including before or after his tenure as Minister of Development.
- Therefore, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about lütfi elvan.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. Lütfi Elvan was born on March 12, 1962 in Ladik, Turkey. Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.

Statement 1:
Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 3: The statement is consistent with the description, as Ankara University is the same university that Lütfi Elvan graduated from in 1984.
Step 4: Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
Step 5: This statement does not contradict the description or the first statement, as it refers to a separate degree that Lütfi Elvan earned from a different institution.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
- Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986, which is two years after his graduation.
- Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States. There is no mention of when he earned this degree.

Conclusion:
The two statements are not necessarily contradictory, but they are incomplete and do not provide enough information to make a clear assessment. Statement 1 implies that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree at Ankara University after his graduation, but it doesn't specify in which field or whether he pursued further education abroad. Statement 2 provides a specific degree and university, but it doesn't indicate when or if Lütfi Elvan obtained this degree alongside his prior education. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the two statements contradict each other or not.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
2. Statement 1 adds that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
3. It is possible for someone to earn a master's degree from the same university they graduated from in a different program or field.
4. Statement 2, however, claims that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
5. It is unlikely for someone to earn a master's degree from two different universities at the same time period.

Conclusion: The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
- Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
- Therefore, statement 1 is consistent with the description as it follows the natural progression of education after graduation.
- Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
- The description does not mention any degree obtained by Lütfi Elvan from the United States or any other foreign country.
- Therefore, statement 2 is not consistent with the description as it introduces new information that is not included in the initial description.

Conclusion:
Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 3: It is possible that Lütfi Elvan completed his master's degree at Ankara University after his graduation in 1984. Therefore, statement 1 is not contradictory to the description.
Step 4: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States. There is no mention of this in the description.
Step 5: The two statements are not contradictory to each other, but statement 2 is not supported by the information provided in the description.
Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory, but statement 2 is not supported by the information provided in the description.
A: Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The description of Lütfi Elvan only mentions him graduating from Ankara University
- Statement 1 says he earned a master's degree from Ankara University, which is consistent with the description
- Statement 2 says he earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware
- There is no mention of Lütfi Elvan studying abroad in the description
- Therefore, statement 2 contradicts the description

Conclusion: 
Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
- It is possible for someone to earn a master's degree after graduating with a bachelor's degree, so Statement 1 does not necessarily contradict the description.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States.
- However, the description only mentions Lütfi Elvan graduating from Ankara University and does not mention any education from an institution outside of Turkey, thus Statement 2 contradicts the description.

Conclusion:
The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory because Statement 2 contradicts the description.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 3: These statements are not necessarily contradictory since Lütfi Elvan could have earned a master's degree from Ankara University after graduating from its Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 4: However, Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States. This contradicts Statement 1 since he cannot earn a master's degree from two different institutions at the same time.
Step 5: Therefore, the answer is NO, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984.
Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.
Step 3: Since Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University in 1984, it is possible that he earned a master's degree from there in 1986. Therefore, statement 1 is not necessarily contradictory to the description.
Step 4: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan earned his master's degree in economics from the University of Delaware in the United States, but the description does not mention anything about him earning a degree from that university.
Conclusion: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory, but statement 2 is not supported by the given description.
A: Step 1: The description only mentions Lütfi Elvan graduating from Ankara University in 1984. 

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986, which is after his graduation. 

Step 3: Statement 2 mentions Lütfi Elvan earning his master's degree from the University of Delaware in the United States. 

Step 4: The two statements do not contradict each other as they refer to different degrees earned by Lütfi Elvan from different universities.

Statement 2:
Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: According to the given description, there is no information about Elvan running for the parliament in the 2015 general election.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election. This contradicts the information in the given description.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election. However, since there is no information in the description about Elvan running for the parliament in 2015, this statement cannot be verified.

Conclusion: The two statements are not contradictory, but Statement 2 cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the answer is no.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
Step 3: Statement 2 provides additional information on where Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in 2015, while statement 1 only indicates that he was elected in general.
Step 4: The two statements are not contradictory, as statement 2 does not contradict statement 1 but rather adds more detailed information to it.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 does not give any information about which constituency Elvan was elected from.

Step 2: 
Statement 2 specifies that Elvan was elected from the province of Karaman.

Step 3: 
Since both statements do not provide contrary information, they are not contradictory.

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The passage does not provide information about Elvan's candidacy or election in the 2015 general election.

Step 2: Statement 1 simply states that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election, without specifying the province.

Step 3: Statement 2 adds the detail that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 4: The two statements do not contradict each other. While Statement 1 is more general and does not specify the province, Statement 2 provides a specific detail about which constituency Elvan won in the 2015 general election. Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: 1. The first statement does not mention which election Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in.
2. The second statement specifies that Elvan was elected for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
3. Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Answer: Yes.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election.

Step 2:
Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: 
Since statement 2 provides additional information about Elvan's election as an MP, which is not included in statement 1, the two statements cannot be contradictory.

Conclusion: 
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The description mentions Lütfi Elvan's previous positions as the Minister of Development and the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications.
- Both of these positions are appointed positions within the government, rather than elected positions.
- The description does not mention any previous experience or campaign efforts by Elvan as a candidate for parliamentary elections.
- Statement 1 suggests that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election, which would be a new piece of information not mentioned in the description.
- Statement 2 clarifies that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman, which would also be a new piece of information not mentioned in the description.

Conclusion: The two statements are contradictory because they suggest new information that contradicts the information given in the description. Specifically, they suggest that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election, which is not mentioned in the description at all. Additionally, statement 2 goes further and specifies that Elvan was elected for a particular province, which the description does not specify. Therefore, there is no indication in the description that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in 2015 or for the province of Karaman.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The description does not provide any information about Elvan being elected as a member of parliament.
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election. This is possible, as there is no contradiction with the information given in the description.
- Statement 2 specifies that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election. This is not mentioned in the description, but it does not necessarily contradict it.
- However, the lack of mention of Karaman in the description raises the possibility that Elvan may not have been elected from that province. It is also possible that he was elected from Karaman but this detail was not included in the description.
- Overall, the two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, but more information is needed to confirm the validity of statement 2.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory, but statement 2 requires further verification.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The description tells us that Lütfi Elvan currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election, but it does not specify whether he still holds that position or if he resigned after being appointed minister.
- Statement 2 clarifies that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election, which suggests that he may not be serving as minister anymore (since holding both positions at the same time would be unusual in Turkey).
- However, the description only provides information until 2015, so we cannot be sure if Elvan continued to serve as minister or became a member of parliament afterwards.

Conclusion: The two statements are not necessarily contradictory, as they provide different pieces of information about Lütfi Elvan's career path without directly contradicting each other. Whether or not Elvan currently serves as a member of parliament or exclusively as minister would require further research beyond the given information.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The description does not mention whether Elvan has ever been a member of parliament or if he ran for parliament in the 2015 general election.
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in the 2015 general election, but it does not specify which province he represented.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
- The two statements do not contradict each other. It is possible that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament in 2015 and that he represented the province of Karaman.

Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

- Statement 1: He was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
- Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.
- The dates in the two statements contradict each other. Statement 1 says he held the position of Minister of Development from 2016 to 2018, while Statement 2 implies he left that position before 2015.
- Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion:
Yes, the two statements about lütfi elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was the Minister of Development from May 2016 to July 2018.

Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.
Step 3: These statements are contradictory because they are providing two different timeframes for Elvan's tenure as Minister of Development. Statement 1 states that Elvan was appointed to the position in 2016 and served until 2018, while Statement 2 suggests that Elvan was no longer in that position as of 2015.

- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from May 2016 until July 2018.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015, which implies that he left the position before May 2016.
- Therefore, the two statements cannot be true at the same time. If statement 1 is true, then statement 2 must be false, and vice versa.

Conclusion:

Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from May 2016 until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.

Step 3: Since statement 1 mentions a specific time period (May 2016 to July 2018), it contradicts statement 2 which implies that Lütfi Elvan left the position of Minister of Development before 2016.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.
Step 3: The two statements provide conflicting information about when Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development.

A: 1. Statement 1 says Elvan was appointed as Minister of Development in May 2016 and served until July 2018.
2. Statement 2 says Elvan held the position of Minister of Development until 2015.

Step 1: There is a discrepancy between the dates in the two statements. Statement 1 says Elvan was appointed in 2016, while Statement 2 suggests he held the position until 2015.
Step 2: Statement 1 is incorrect as Elvan could not have held the position until 2018 and then be elected to the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey, as described in the introductory description.

Step 4: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.

Step 3: The description only provides Lütfi Elvan's birthplace and current position, without mentioning where he studied. However, statement 1 claims that he graduated from Ankara University, while statement 2 claims that he graduated from Istanbul Technical University's Department of Civil Engineering. This is a potential contradiction, as it cannot be the case that he graduated from both universities.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician, currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: The description further states that he was born on March 12, 1962, in Turkey.

Step 3: To answer the question, we need to examine the two statements provided:

 - Statement 1: Elvan graduated from Ankara University.
 
 - Statement 2: Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: The two statements appear to be contradictory, as they mention different universities from where Lütfi Elvan might have graduated.

Step 5: However, it is also possible that Lütfi Elvan graduated from both universities, which would not make the statements contradictory.

Conclusion: Based on the given information, we cannot say for sure if the two statements are contradictory. We need more information to determine if Lütfi Elvan graduated from both universities or just one of them.
A: Step 1: The given description mentions only the birthplace and current position of Lütfi Elvan.

Step 2: Statement 1 provides additional information about his education, stating that he graduated from Ankara University.

Step 3: Statement 2 also provides information about his education, but it contradicts Statement 1 by stating that he graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University instead of Ankara University.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description mentions Elvan's current position as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey, but nothing about his educational background.
Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan graduated from Ankara University, but does not specify his degree or field of study.
Step 3: Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1 by stating that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University, implying that he did not attend Ankara University.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The beginning of the description states that Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician, who serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.
Step 2: The description also mentions his birth date and the fact that he was born in Turkey.

Statement 1: Elvan graduated from Ankara University. 
Step 3: The statement does not contradict any of the information given in the description. It simply adds new information about Elvan's educational background.

Statement 2: Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. 
Step 4: The statement contradicts the information given in the description. The description does not mention Istanbul Technical University as Elvan's alma mater, but rather, states that he graduated from Ankara University.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description mentions Elvan's position as Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey and his birthplace on March 12, 1962, in Turkey.

Step 2: Statement 1 indicates that Elvan graduated from Ankara University.

Step 3: Statement 2 indicates that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 4: The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as Elvan could have attended and graduated from both universities.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description only mentions Elvan's birthplace and current position, but does not provide information about his education.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Elvan graduated from Ankara University, while Statement 2 claims that he graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

Step 3: The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other, as Elvan could have potentially attended both universities and obtained degrees from each.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description mentions Lütfi Elvan's current position as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. 

Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan graduated from Ankara University. 

Step 3: The description does not provide any information about where Lütfi Elvan received his education. 

Step 4: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. 

Step 5: The two statements are contradictory as they provide different information about where Lütfi Elvan graduated from.

In 1991, he obtained a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Exeter, in the United Kingdom. Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked in various positions until 2002. Between 2011 and 2013, he served as the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications. He was then appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, a position he held until 2015. In November 2015, Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Statement 1:
He was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: According to the description, Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 4: The two statements contradict each other regarding the duration of Lütfi Elvan's tenure as the Minister of Development. Statement 1 suggests he held the position from May 2016 to July 2018, while Statement 2 suggests he held the position from 2013 to 2015.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Review the description and identify the dates mentioned for Lütfi Elvan's tenure as Minister of Development.
- The description notes that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013 and held the position until 2015.

Step 2: Compare the dates in the statement 1 and statement 2 with the information in the description.
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018. These dates are not mentioned in the description.
- Statement 2 correctly states that Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 3: Compare the information in the two statements with each other.
- Statement 1 claims that Elvan held the position of Minister of Development in a later time period than the one stated in the description and in statement 2.
- Statement 2 and the description both indicate that Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015, which contradicts the time period stated in statement 1.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 3: Comparing the two statements, we can see that they contradict each other. Statement 1 states that Elvan held the position after 2015, while statement 2 states that he held the position until 2015.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1: He was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.
- Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

These two statements appear to contradict each other, as they provide different time frames for Lütfi Elvan's tenure as Minister of Development. Statement 1 says he held the position from May 2016 to July 2018, while Statement 2 says he held the position from 2013 to 2015, which is before and after Statement 1's time frame. Therefore, both statements cannot be true at the same time.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held this position until July 2018.

Step 2: The second statement says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 3: The two statements appear to be contradictory because the first statement refers to a different time period than the second statement.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Review the description and find the relevant information about Lütfi Elvan's tenure as Minister of Development.
Step 2: Compare the dates mentioned in the two statements with the dates mentioned in the description. 
Step 3: Determine if there is a discrepancy in the dates, and if so, evaluate whether the statements are contradictory.

Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan served as the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 2: Statement 1 indicates that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018. Statement 2, on the other hand, says that Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 3: There is a clear discrepancy between the dates mentioned in the two statements. Statement 1 suggests that Elvan held the position of Minister of Development for two years after the description indicates he had already left the position. Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.
- These two statements appear to contradict each other because they refer to different time periods for the same position. 

Conclusion: 

Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 3: Since both statements mention Lütfi Elvan holding the position of Minister of Development, they could potentially be contradictory.

Step 4: However, Statement 2 specifies that Lütfi Elvan held the position from 2013 to 2015, while Statement 1 mentions a different timeframe (May 2016 to July 2018). Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory but rather describe different periods of time.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015.

Step 3: Statement 1 and 2 contradict each other as they provide different time periods for Lütfi Elvan's tenure as Minister of Development.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018. 

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan held the position of Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015. 

Step 3: Since Statement 1 states that Lütfi Elvan was the Minister of Development from May 2016 to July 2018, and Statement 2 states that he was the Minister of Development from 2013 to 2015, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 states that Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for the AKP and later served as the deputy chairman of the party's Ankara branch.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan started his political career as an economic expert for the AKP, while Statement 2 says he began his political career as an MP in 2015.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Statement 1 says Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for the AKP.
2. Statement 2 says Elvan started his political career as a member of parliament for the AKP in 2015.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for the AKP and later served as the party's deputy chairman in Ankara.

A: Step 1: Compare the two statements.

Statement 1: Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician and the current Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the two statements.

- Statement 1 includes the phrase "who currently serves," implying that Lütfi Elvan's role as Minister of Treasury and Finance may change in the future.
- Statement 2 uses the present tense verb form "is" to describe Lütfi Elvan's Ministerial position, suggesting that his current role is more permanent.

Step 3: Determine whether the statements are contradictory.

The two statements provide different information about Lütfi Elvan's birthplace. Statement 1 says he was born in Ladik, Turkey, while Statement 2 says he was born in the province of Karaman, Turkey.

Step 2: 

The province of Karaman is in Central Anatolia, while Ladik is in the Samsun Province, which is in the Black Sea region of Turkey.

Conclusion: 

Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement says Lütfi Elvan was born in Ladik, Turkey.

Step 3: According to a quick Google search, Ladik is not in Karaman Province but is actually located in the province of Samsun.

Step 4: Since the two statements provide different birthplaces for Lütfi Elvan and one of them is incorrect, we can conclude that they are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says Lütfi Elvan was born in Ladik, Turkey.

Step 3: Therefore, since Ladik and Karaman are two distinct geographical locations, the two statements contradict each other.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The two statements provide different places of birth for Lütfi Elvan - Ladik and Karaman.
- It is possible that Ladik is a district or town within the province of Karaman, which would make the statements consistent.
- However, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that this is the case.
- Therefore, the two statements could be contradictory.

Conclusion: 
Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are potentially contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
The two statements provide different information on where Lütfi Elvan was born.

Step 2: 
Statement 1 claims that he was born in Ladik, while statement 2 claims that he was born in the province of Karaman.

Step 3: 
According to sources, Ladik is a district in the province of Samsun, which is located in northern Turkey, while Karaman is a province in central Turkey.

Statement 2:
Berat Albayrak resigned from the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey, which Lütfi Elvan currently holds.

Step 2: Statement 2 confirms that Berat Albayrak resigned from the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance, but does not mention anything about Elvan taking his place.

Step 3: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory as they both confirm Berat Albayrak's resignation from the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance but statement 1 provides additional information about Elvan's appointment as his successor.

A: Step-by-step reasoning: 
- Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the new Minister of Treasury and Finance after the resignation of Berat Albayrak. 
- Statement 2 says that Berat Albayrak resigned from the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance, which Lütfi Elvan currently holds.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 

Statement 1: After the resignation of Berat Albayrak, Elvan was appointed as the new Minister of Treasury and Finance by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on November 10, 2020.

Step 4: Statement 1 indicates that Elvan is currently holding the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance, while Statement 2 confirms that there was a resignation from the same position. 

Step 5: The two statements are not contradictory but complement each other. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was appointed as the new Minister of Treasury and Finance by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on November 10, 2020. 

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Berat Albayrak resigned from the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey, which Lütfi Elvan currently holds.

Statement 1 provides information about how he got appointed to the position, while Statement 2 provides information about the circumstances that led to his appointment. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in November 2020 after the resignation of Berat Albayrak.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 states that "After the resignation of Berat Albayrak, Elvan was appointed as the new Minister of Treasury and Finance by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on November 10, 2020." This implies that Lütfi Elvan is currently the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

Step 2: Statement 2 states that "Berat Albayrak resigned from the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey, which Lütfi Elvan currently holds." This implies that Lütfi Elvan is currently the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.

A: Step 1: 
The description states that Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.

Step 2: 
Statement 1 claims that he obtained his Master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley.

Step 3:
Since the description does not mention Lütfi Elvan obtaining a Master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, Statement 1 contradicts the description.

Step 4:
Statement 2 claims that he obtained his master's degree in civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the UK.

Step 5:
Since the description does not mention where Lütfi Elvan obtained his Master's degree, Statement 2 does not necessarily contradict the description.

No, only Statement 1 contradicts the description.
A: Step 1: The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, but it doesn't mention anything about where he obtained his Master's degree.

A: Step 1: According to the description, Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.

Step 2: Statement 1 contradicts the description because it says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, without mentioning where he completed his undergraduate studies. Therefore, it is unclear whether he attended both Middle East Technical University and UC Berkeley or if he transferred from one to the other.

Step 3: Statement 2 does not contradict the description but adds new information to it. It says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his master's degree in civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the UK, but it does not mention his undergraduate studies or any positions he held in the government.

Step 2: The second statement says that Elvan was born on March 12, 1962, in the province of Karaman, Turkey.
Step 3: These two statements contradict each other in terms of where Elvan was born.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan was born in Nazilli, Aydın in 1962.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was born in the province of Karaman, Turkey on March 12, 1962.
- These two statements offer different birthplaces for Elvan, which could be seen as contradictory, unless there is an explanation for the discrepancy (e.g., Elvan was born in Karaman but grew up in Nazilli).
- However, given that the description in the prompt doesn't mention Elvan's birthplace, we don't have enough context to determine which statement is correct (if either).
- Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: 
We cannot determine if the two statements are contradictory without further information. Answer: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 claims that Elvan was born in Nazilli, Aydın in 1962. 
Step 2: Statement 2 claims that Elvan was born on March 12, 1962, in the province of Karaman, Turkey. 

Step 3: Both statements cannot be true as they describe Elvan's place of birth differently. 

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The first statement states that Elvan was born in Nazilli, Aydın in 1962.
Step 2: The second statement states that Elvan was born on March 12, 1962, in the province of Karaman, Turkey.
Step 3: These two statements do not agree on the birthplace of Elvan.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
Conclusion: Yes
A: Step 1: The first statement mentions that Lütfi Elvan was born in Nazilli, Aydın in 1962.
Step 2: The second statement mentions that Lütfi Elvan was born on March 12, 1962, in the province of Karaman, Turkey.
Step 3: These two statements seem to present conflicting information about Lütfi Elvan's place of birth.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory as they present different information about his place of birth.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Elvan was born in Nazilli, Aydın in 1962, while the second statement says he was born in the province of Karaman, Turkey.

Step 2: Nazilli is a town in the Aydın province, which is located in western Turkey. Karaman, on the other hand, is a province in central Turkey.

Step 3: Therefore, the two statements cannot refer to the same place of birth.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.
Step 3: These two statements are not contradictory because Statement 2 is true, as it aligns with the information in the provided description. However, Statement 1 is not accurate as the description clearly states that he was the Minister of Development from 2013 until 2015, two years earlier than the date mentioned in the statement.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory, but Statement 1 is false.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.

Statement 1: Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.
Statement 2: Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.

It is also mentioned that he was appointed as the Minister of Development in 2013, which supports Statement 2.

Step 4: However, Statement 1 contradicts the given description as it says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, whereas the description states that he held the position from 2013-2015.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016 and held the position until July 2018.

A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Development in May 2016, a position he held until July 2018.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013.

Step 3: There is no contradiction between the two statements since they refer to different positions held by Lütfi Elvan at different points in time. Statement 2 talks about his appointment as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in 2013, which is before the period of Statement 1 (which is from May 2016 to July 2018) when he was the Minister of Development.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that he was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: The two statements are not contradictory as they are both stating that Elvan was elected to a political position in 2015. Statement 1 provides further details about his political party affiliation and the specific assembly he was elected to, while statement 2 specifies the province he was elected to represent.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
2. Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.
3. Both statements talk about Elvan being elected, but the positions mentioned are different - one mentions the Grand National Assembly and the other mentions the provincial parliament.
4. However, both statements can be true at the same time because being a member of the Grand National Assembly also means being a member of parliament for a particular province.
5. Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: 1. Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).
2. Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.
3. Both statements indicate that Elvan was elected to a political office in 2015.
4. However, statement 1 specifies that Elvan was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while statement 2 specifies that he was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara.
5. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the country's legislative body, while parliament refers to the Grand National Assembly and the president of the Republic of Turkey.
6. Therefore, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory as Elvan could have been elected to both the Grand National Assembly and as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara.
7. Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: The two statements both mention Elvan being elected to a political position but refer to different levels of government - Statement 1 refers to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while Statement 2 refers to parliament for the province of Ankara.

Step 4: The two statements do not contradict each other as they refer to different levels of government, and it is possible for someone to hold positions in both the national assembly and provincial parliament.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the parliament of Turkey, and members are elected by the people in general elections. Therefore, Elvan could have been elected as a member of both the Grand National Assembly and parliament for the province of Ankara in the same elections.

Step 4: Conclusion - No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: Both statements agree that Elvan was elected to a political office in 2015.

Step 4: However, statement 1 refers to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while statement 2 refers to a specific province (Ankara).

Step 5: Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but provide different information about Elvan's election in 2015.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: Both statements talk about Elvan being elected to a position in 2015, but they mention different positions. Statement 1 says he was elected to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while statement 2 says he was elected as a member of parliament for Ankara.

Step 4: The Turkish Grand National Assembly (TGNA) is the unicameral parliament of Turkey, so both statements refer to Elvan being elected to a parliamentary position. However, the first statement specifies that he was elected to the TGNA as a member of the AK Party, while the second statement only mentions that he was elected as a member of parliament for Ankara without mentioning his party affiliation.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory as they refer to different positions Elvan was elected to, but they both mention his election to a parliamentary role in 2015.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: It is possible for both statements to be true if the Turkish Grand National Assembly and the parliament for the province of Ankara refer to the same governing body.

Step 4: According to Turkey's governmental structure, the Turkish Grand National Assembly is the unicameral legislative body of Turkey, which means that it is the highest level of the legislative branch of Turkey. Therefore, if Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, it means that he was elected as a member of parliament in Ankara as well.

Step 5: Hence, the two statements are not contradictory, and they could both be true based on Turkey's governmental structure.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.
Step 3: The 2015 general elections in Turkey included elections for the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which is the Turkish parliament, among other elections.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory as they both refer to Elvan being elected as a member of parliament in Turkey in the 2015 general elections, just with different levels of detail.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in November 2015.

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Ankara in the 2015 general elections.

Step 3: The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other because it is possible for Elvan to be both a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and a member of parliament for the province of Ankara at the same time.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.

After the resignation of Berat Albayrak, Elvan was appointed as the new Minister of Treasury and Finance by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on November 10, 2020.

Step 5: Now let's analyze the two statements:

- Statement 1: Elvan is married and has two children.
- Statement 2: Lütfi Elvan has two children.

Step 6: Both statements refer to the same information about Elvan having two children. 

Step 7: Thus, the two statements are not contradictory. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The first statement says "Elvan is married and has two children."
Step 2: The second statement says "Lütfi Elvan has two children."
Step 3: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan has two children.
Step 4: The first statement adds that he is married, while the second statement does not provide information on his marital status.
Step 5: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, and both can be true at the same time.
Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1: "Elvan is married and has two children."
- Statement 2: "Lütfi Elvan has two children."
- Both statements seem to refer to the same fact, which is Elvan being a parent of two children.
- The only difference is that statement 1 also includes information about Elvan's marital status.
- However, statement 2 also implies that Elvan must be married or have been married at some point in order to have children.
- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan has two children.
Step 2: Statement 1 adds that Elvan is married.
Step 3: The information in Statement 1 does not contradict any of the information in the description of Elvan.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.
Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: The first statement says that Elvan is married and has two children.

Step 2: The second statement says that Elvan has two children.

Step 3: Both statements mention Elvan having two children.

Step 4: The first statement provides additional information about Elvan being married, which is not mentioned in the second statement.

Step 5: The two statements do not contradict each other, as they are both true and do not make conflicting claims.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 refers to Elvan's marital status and number of children.
- Statement 2 refers to Elvan's number of children only.
- It is possible for someone to have children without being married, so statement 2 does not necessarily contradict statement 1.
- However, if Elvan is married, statement 2 would be incomplete as it does not mention his marital status.
- Therefore, the statements are not necessarily contradictory but statement 2 may be incomplete.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: From the given description, we know that Lütfi Elvan's personal life is not discussed. 

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Elvan is married and has two children. 

Step 3: Statement 2 only discusses the number of children Elvan has. 

Step 4: The two statements do not directly contradict each other. However, Statement 1 provides additional information about Elvan's personal life that is not mentioned in the given description. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1: "Elvan is married and has two children."
- Statement 2: "Lütfi Elvan has two children."
- Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan has two children.
- Statement 1 adds the information that he is also married, but this does not contradict statement 2 in any way.
- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: In the given description, there is no information provided about whether or not Lütfi Elvan is married.

Step 2: Both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan has two children, which is consistent with the information provided in the description.

Step 3: The two statements do not provide conflicting information about Lütfi Elvan, but only one of them mentions his marital status.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- The first statement explicitly mentions that Elvan is married, while the second statement provides no information about his marital status.
- However, both statements state that Elvan has two children.
- Therefore, the first statement may include additional information about Elvan's personal life, but it does not contradict the second statement, which focuses solely on the number of his children.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who currently serves as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. He was born on March 12, 1962 in Turkey. Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984. Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Statement 1:
Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics.

Statement 2:
Lütfi Elvan obtained his PhD in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step 1: The description only mentions that Lütfi Elvan earned a master's degree from Ankara University, but it doesn't mention anything about him obtaining a Ph.D. in economics.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics, but it doesn't specify from which university.

Step 3: Statement 2 contradicts statement 1 by specifying that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991, but the original description only mentions him earning a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Looking at the given description, there is no mention of Lütfi Elvan obtaining a Ph.D. in economics.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics but does not specify when or from which institution.

Step 3: Statement 2 specifies that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 4: Since Statement 1 does not provide any details about when or where Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics, it is not necessarily contradictory to Statement 2.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The original description mentions Lütfi Elvan obtaining a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 mentions Lütfi Elvan obtaining a Ph.D. in economics, but it does not specify where or when.

Step 3: Statement 2 mentions Lütfi Elvan obtaining his PhD in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 4: Since Statement 2 specifies that Lütfi Elvan received his PhD from the same university he received his master's degree from, it supports the information in the original description. Therefore, Statement 1 is not contradictory but it is incomplete as it does not provide details on where or when Lütfi Elvan obtained his PhD.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The initial description does not mention whether Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. degree or not.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. degree in economics. This statement does not mention when or from where he obtained the degree.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. degree in economics from Ankara University in 1991. This statement provides a specific time and place for the degree.

Step 4: Since statement 2 is more specific and provides more information, it is not contradictory to the initial description, even though it slightly contradicts statement 1.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory, but statement 2 provides more specific information than statement 1.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- The initial description does not mention whether Lütfi Elvan has a Ph.D. or not.
- Statement 1 asserts that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics, but does not specify where or when.
- Statement 2 asserts that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991, which matches his educational background mentioned in the initial description.
- Therefore, statement 2 provides more specific information about Lütfi Elvan's Ph.D. than statement 1, and confirms that he indeed has a Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description mentions Lütfi Elvan obtaining a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics.

Step 3: The description does not mention Lütfi Elvan obtaining a Ph.D. degree.

Step 4: Statement 2 specifies that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991.

Step 5: The information provided in Statement 2 does not contradict the information provided in the description. It simply provides more detail about Lütfi Elvan's education.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Reasoning:
The description of Lütfi Elvan provided only mentions his undergraduate and master's degree from Ankara University. However, Statement 1 claims that he obtained a Ph.D. in economics without specifying any details about where or when he earned it. On the other hand, Statement 2 gives specific information about Lütfi Elvan's Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991, which aligns with his earlier academic history at the same university.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not contradictory. Statement 2 provides additional details that support the accuracy of Statement 1.
A: Step 1: The description mentions that Lütfi Elvan graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984 and earned a master's degree from the same university in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics. However, there is no mention of a Ph.D. degree in the description.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991. This statement contradicts the absence of any mention of a Ph.D. degree in the earlier description.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics.
Step 2: Statement 2 claims that Lütfi Elvan obtained his PhD in economics from Ankara University in 1991.
Step 3: However, the initial description of Lütfi Elvan does not mention him obtaining a Ph.D. degree.
Step 4: Therefore, Statement 1 and Statement 2 are contradictory.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: According to the given description, it is mentioned that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 2: Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained a Ph.D. in economics, but there is no mention of Lütfi Elvan obtaining a Ph.D. in the given description.

Step 3: Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in economics from Ankara University in 1991. Although there is no mention of Lütfi Elvan obtaining a Ph.D. in the given description, it is mentioned that he graduated from Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science in 1984 and earned a master's degree from Ankara University in 1986.

Step 4: Therefore, Statement 2 is more specific and consistent with the information provided in the given description.

Description:
Lütfi Elvan is a Turkish economist and politician. He was born on March 12, 1962, in Nazilli, Turkey. He studied at Ankara University's Faculty of Political Science before receiving a master's degree in economic planning from the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. Elvan began his political career as an economic expert for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and later served as the deputy chairman of the party's Ankara branch.

Statement 1:
In 2011, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and has continued to serve in this role.

Statement 2:
He was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Are the two statements about lütfi elvan contradictory? First, show your reasoning in a step-by-step fashion. Then conclude with yes or no.

A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan has been a Member of Parliament for the AKP since 2011.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
- These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other because a person can be elected as a member of parliament for a specific province in a certain election while also being a member of parliament for a political party before and after that election.
- Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: In Statement 1, it is mentioned that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and has continued to serve in this role. However, it does not mention when he was elected.

Step 2: In Statement 2, it is mentioned that he was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: By comparing the two statements, we can infer that Lütfi Elvan was not a member of parliament before the 2015 general election.

Step 4: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and continues to serve in this role. 

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election. 

Step 3: These statements do not contradict each other as they refer to different periods of time. Statement 1 is a general statement about his political career and does not specify any particular election. Statement 2, on the other hand, refers to his election in 2015. 

Conclusion: No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.
A: Step 1. Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and has continued to serve in this role.

Step 2. Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3. Both statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 talks about Elvan's general election as a Member of Parliament, while Statement 2 specifies that he was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 indicates that Lütfi Elvan has been a Member of Parliament for the AKP since 2011.
Step 2: Statement 2 indicates that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for Karaman in 2015.
Step 3: These two statements are not necessarily contradictory as it is possible for someone to be elected as an MP for a specific province while also serving as an MP for a political party.
Step 4: Therefore, the answer is no, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan has been serving as a Member of Parliament for the AKP since 2011.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the province of Karaman in 2015.
- These two statements do not necessarily contradict each other because it is possible that Elvan was already a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2015 and was re-elected to represent Karaman province in the same election.
- However, if Elvan was not a Member of Parliament for the AKP in 2015 and was only elected to represent Karaman province in that year, then the two statements would be contradictory because they present different information about when and how Elvan became a Member of Parliament.

Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine if the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step 1: In statement 1, it is mentioned that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament for the AKP and has continued to serve in this role.

Step 2: In statement 2, it is mentioned that he was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: Both statements talk about Lütfi Elvan being a Member of Parliament, but statement 1 does not mention the year of his election, while statement 2 specifically mentions that he was elected in the 2015 general election and for the province of Karaman.

Step 4: As the statements do not contradict each other and both mention Lütfi Elvan being a Member of Parliament, the answer is no, they are not contradictory.
A: Step 1: 
Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a Member of Parliament in 2011 for AKP and has continued to serve in this role.

Step 2: 
Statement 2 says that he was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.

Step 3: 
Since Lütfi Elvan served as a Member of Parliament prior to the 2015 general election and Statement 2 states that he was elected as a member of parliament in 2015, it is possible that he was re-elected for a different province. Therefore, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements are not necessarily contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:

- Statement 1 says that Elvan was elected as an MP for the AKP and has continued in this role.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan was elected as an MP for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
- These two statements do not appear to be contradictory, as Statement 2 could be seen as providing more specific information about Elvan's election to parliament than Statement 1.
- It is possible that Elvan was elected as an MP for the AKP in an earlier election (before 2015) and then was re-elected specifically to represent the province of Karaman in 2015.

Conclusion: No, the two statements are not contradictory.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Lütfi Elvan has been serving as a Member of Parliament for the AKP since 2011.
- Statement 2 says that Lütfi Elvan was elected as a member of parliament for the province of Karaman in the 2015 general election.
- Therefore, both statements seem to suggest that Lütfi Elvan served as a member of parliament for AKP in both 2011 and 2015.

Conclusion:
No, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are not contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.

Step 2: Statement 1 asserts that he later obtained his Master's degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.

Step 3: Statement 2 asserts that he obtained his Master's degree in the field of civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom.

- The description states that Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.
- Statement 1 claims that he later obtained his Master's degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.
- Statement 2 claims that he obtained his master's degree in the field of civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom.

- Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory.

Conclusion: No
A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.

Step 2: Statement 1 mentions that he later obtained his Master's degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.

Step 3: Statement 2 mentions that he obtained his master's degree in the field of civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom.

A: Step 1: The description states that Lütfi Elvan studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara. 

Step 2: Statement 1 says that he later obtained his Master's degree in Transportation Planning and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. 

Step 3: Statement 2 says that he obtained his master's degree in the field of civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. 

Step 4: Since both statements mention that Lütfi Elvan obtained a master's degree, they could potentially be contradictory if they are referring to different fields of study. 

Step 5: However, Statement 1 explicitly mentions that the master's degree is in Transportation Planning and Engineering, while Statement 2 only mentions that it is in the field of civil engineering. 

Step 6: Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory as they could be referring to different specializations within the broader field of civil engineering.

- If statement 2 is true, statement 1 cannot be true, as it states that Elvan started working at the Ministry of Finance six years earlier.
- If statement 1 is true, statement 2 could still be true, as it only specifies the year Elvan joined the Ministry, not the exact date or month.
- Therefore, the statements are contradictory if we assume that both of them are meant to be precise descriptions of Elvan's career history.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 mentions that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked there until 2002. 

Step 2: Statement 2 mentions that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1992. 

Step 3: Since statement 1 explicitly says that Elvan worked in various positions in the Ministry of Finance from 1986 to 2002, and statement 2 suggests that he joined the Ministry in 1992, one could argue that these statements are contradictory. 

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked there until 2002.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1992.
Step 3: These two statements cannot both be true because Statement 1 implies that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance before 1992, while Statement 2 says he joined in 1992.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked there until 2002. 

Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1992. 

Step 3: These two statements seem to contradict each other, as they give different years for when Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance. 

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: According to the description, Elvan obtained his Ph.D. in 1991 and became the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey at an unknown date.

Step 2: Statement 1 claims that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked there until 2002.

Step 3: Statement 2 claims that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1992.

Step 4: Since the description does not mention the exact date of Elvan's appointment as Minister of Treasury and Finance, it is not possible to determine whether Statement 1 is contradictory or not. 

Conclusion: No.
A: Step-by-step reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked there until 2002.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in the year 1992.
- These two statements cannot both be true at the same time.
- If Statement 1 is true, then Statement 2 is false, because it gives a later year for Elvan's start at the Ministry.
- If Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 is false, because it implies that Elvan joined the Ministry earlier than 1992.
- Therefore, the two statements are contradictory.

Conclusion: Yes, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
A: Step 1: Statement 1 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked until 2002.
Step 2: Statement 2 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1992.
Step 3: Both statements cannot be true at the same time, as they have different years for when Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance.
Step 4: Therefore, the two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory.
Conclusion: Yes, the two statements are contradictory.
A: Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- Statement 1 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1986 and worked there until 2002.
- Statement 2 says that Elvan joined the Ministry of Finance in 1992.
- These two statements cannot be both true, as they provide different years of Elvan's joining the Ministry of Finance.
- Since the information provided in the description states that Elvan obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1991, it is more likely that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, as Elvan might have started working for the Ministry of Finance after completing his Ph.D. degree.

Conclusion:
The two statements about Lütfi Elvan are contradictory, and Statement 2 is likely false.
