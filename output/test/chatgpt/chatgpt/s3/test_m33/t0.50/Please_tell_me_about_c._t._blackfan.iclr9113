One of Blackfan's most notable discoveries was the identification of a new type of anemia that he named \"hypoplastic anemia.\" He determined that this type of anemia was caused by a failure of the bone marrow to produce enough red blood cells, and he developed new treatments using blood transfusions and steroids to stimulate the bone marrow and increase the production of red blood cells.
