It was established on May 17, 1945, in the city of Nagoya and was responsible for the defense of the central region of Honshu Island, the largest island in Japan. The Thirty-First Army was commanded by General Shizuichi Tanaka, who was also the commanding officer of the 16th Area Army. The main objective of the Thirty-First Army was to defend the central region of Honshu Island against the expected Allied invasion. However, due to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent surrender of Japan, the Thirty-First Army did not see any combat action. After the surrender of Japan, the Thirty-First Army was dissolved, and its soldiers were demobilized. Many of the soldiers returned to their hometowns, while others were captured and detained by allied forces. Some of the officers were later tried for war crimes.

The army was also responsible for maintaining communication lines to the Japanese fleet and providing support to the naval forces in the area. The Thirty-First Army was under the command of Lt. General Suzuki S\u014dsaku and was composed of several divisions, including the 102nd Infantry Division, 103rd Infantry Division, and the 68th Independent Mixed Brigade.

Despite this, the army was able to mount a strong defense of the Visayas region, using a combination of fortifications, guerrilla tactics, and amphibious assaults.\n\nStatement 1:\nThe Thirty-First Army was dissolved in August 1945.\n\nStatement 2:\nThe Thirty-First Army was dissolved in August 1945, following Japan's surrender to the Allied forces.\n\nPlease explain whether the statements about Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory.\nProvide your explanation only.\n", "A": ["The statements about Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory.
