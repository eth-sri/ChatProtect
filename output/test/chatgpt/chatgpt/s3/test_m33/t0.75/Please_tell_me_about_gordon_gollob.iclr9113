{"Q": "I give you the beginning of a description about gordon gollob.\nThen follow two statements.\n\nDescription:\n Gordon Gollob was a fighter pilot during World War II. Gordon Gollob was born on January 16, 1912. Gollob quickly became known for his flying skills. He flew in the Spanish Civil War, where he shot down 14 enemy planes. During World War II, Gollob became one of the most successful fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe. He was credited with shooting down 150 enemy planes, making him the third-highest scoring German ace of the war. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military honor in Germany at the time. Gollob was known for his aggressive flying style and his willingness to take risks. He often flew alone, seeking out enemy planes to engage in dogfights. He was also known for his leadership skills and was promoted to the rank of Major in 1943. After the war, he was held as a prisoner of war by the Allies for several years before being released.\n\nStatement 1:\nHe went on to work as a commercial pilot after his release from captivity.\n\nStatement 2:\nHe went on to become a successful businessman after the war.\n\nPlease explain whether the statements about gordon gollob are contradictory.\nProvide your explanation only.\n", "A": ["The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory, but they present two different possibilities for his post-war career.
