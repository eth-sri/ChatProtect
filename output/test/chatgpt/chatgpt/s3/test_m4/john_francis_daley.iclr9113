Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory. Statement 1 implies that he has won awards, whereas Statement 2 implies that he has only received nominations. Winning an award is different from being nominated for one, so there is no contradiction. Both statements can be true at the same time.
A: The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory, but rather complimentary. Statement 1 indicates that he has received awards for his work in the industry, while Statement 2 specifies that he has received award nominations specifically for his work as a screenwriter. Together, these statements showcase Daley's versatility and success in multiple aspects of the entertainment industry.
A: The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that he has received several awards for his work in the industry, which could potentially include his work as an actor, screenwriter, or director. The second statement specifically mentions his award nominations as a screenwriter, which does not contradict the first statement.

The first statement indicates that Daley has received several awards for his work in the industry, which could refer to any of the three areas he works in (acting, screenwriting, directing).

A: No, the statements are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that Daley has received several awards for his work in the industry, while the second statement mentions that he has received award nominations for his work as a screenwriter.
