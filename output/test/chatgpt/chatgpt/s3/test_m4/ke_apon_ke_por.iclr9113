Description:
Ke Apon Ke Por is a popular Bengali television serial that airs on the Zee Bangla channel. The show premiered on October 25, 2016, and has been running successfully ever since.

Statement 1:
The series is produced by Boyhood Productions and is directed by Sushanta Das.

Statement 2:
Ke Apon Ke Por is directed by Boyei Gelo's director, Amit Sengupta.

Please explain whether the statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory because statement 1 says that the series is directed by Sushanta Das while statement 2 says that it is directed by Amit Sengupta. However, both statements agree that the series is produced by Boyhood Productions and has been airing on Zee Bangla since October 25, 2016.
A: The statements are contradictory because they attribute different directors to the show. Statement 1 says that the series is directed by Sushanta Das, while statement 2 credits Amit Sengupta with the direction. Therefore, it's unclear which director is actually responsible for Ke Apon Ke Por.
A: The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the show is produced by Boyhood Productions and directed by Sushanta Das, while in Statement 2, it is mentioned that the director is Amit Sengupta, who directed another show called Boyei Gelo. It is unclear whether Boyhood Productions is still involved in the production of the show or if there has been a change in the direction team. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the two statements.
A: The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the series is directed by Sushanta Das, while statement 2 suggests that the director is Amit Sengupta. As both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other.
A: The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the series is produced by Boyhood Productions and directed by Sushanta Das, while Statement 2 says that it is directed by Amit Sengupta, who directed Boyei Gelo.

Description:
Ke Apon Ke Por is a popular Bengali television drama series that airs on Star Jalsha. The show premiered on 25 July 2016 and has since become a huge hit among Bengali viewers. The show revolves around the character of Joba, a strong and independent woman who is the only breadwinner of her family.

Statement 1 mentions that Joba married a man named Surya who is from a wealthy family, while statement 2 mentions that she is married to a character named Param who is a supportive husband and helps her in her struggles. These two statements cannot be true at the same time, therefore they contradict each other.
