The Bailey-Thompson house is a two-story red brick building, featuring various decorative elements such as dentil moldings, cornices, and an elaborate entrance with a fanlight and sidelights.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, due to its significance as one of the few remaining examples of Queen Anne architecture in the area, as well as its connection to William Bailey, who played an important role in Delano's development. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House has been restored and is a beautiful representation of the Queen Anne style in a small-town context.

Description:
The Bailey-Thompson house is a historic residence located in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. It was built in 1922 and was designed by architect James Broadwell in the Colonial Revival style. The house is significant for its architectural design and for its association with two prominent Memphis families, the Baileys and the Thompsons. The Bailey family, led by Napoleon Hill Bailey, was a prominent banking family in Memphis, who was involved in several successful businesses such as Bailey, Inc. (a retail business), Tri-State Motors, Inc., and the Tennessee-Pueblo Development Company. The house was owned by the Bailey family until 1940 when it was purchased by the Thompson family. J. C. Thompson, the patriarch of the Thompson family, was the founder of the Thompson Realty Company and later served as president of the Memphis Real Estate Board. The house remained in the Thompson family until 1966 when it was sold to another local family. The Bailey-Thompson house is a two-story red brick building, featuring various decorative elements such as dentil moldings, cornices, and an elaborate entrance with a fanlight and sidelights. The structure is a fine example of the Colonial Revival style, which was popular in the United States in the first half of the 20th century.

Statement 1:
In 1975, it was sold to the McGahey family.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about Bailey–Thompson House.
Then follow two statements.

Description:


Statement 1:
This two-story wooden structure was designed in the Queen Anne architectural style and built in 1901.

Statement 2:
This two-story wooden structure was designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1902.

Please explain whether the statements about Bailey–Thompson House are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Bailey–Thompson House are contradictory. 

Statement 1 states that the house was designed in the Queen Anne architectural style and built in 1901, while Statement 2 claims that the house was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1902. Frank Lloyd Wright was not known for designing buildings in the Queen Anne style, so it is unlikely that both statements can be true. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other.
