Description:
Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 – May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin.

He was born on October 14, 1843, in Munich, Bavaria, as Friedrich August Albrecht Moritz Ernst Konstantin, to Prince Moritz of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Meiningen. His parents were of high status in Europe, with his father being a member of the German nobility and his mother hailing from one of the most respected royal families of the time. Prince Albert was raised in a noble family and received an education in line with his position. He went on to serve in the military and fought for Austria in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, during which the United German States and the Austrian Empire battled for supremacy. In 1868, Prince Albert’s father passed away, and his elder brother, Ernst I, succeeded the dukedom of Saxe-Altenburg. While Albert did not inherit the title, he remained active in the political and social life of the duchy. In terms of personal relationships, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 9, 1873, in Berlin. Marie was the daughter of Prince Carl of Prussia and Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. The couple had five children together:

1. Marie Auguste (1874-1955)
2. Elisabeth Henriette (1875-1945)
3. Albrecht Frederick (1877-1890)
4. Friedrich Ernst (1878-1900)
5. Charlotte Agnes (1899-1989)

Tragically, two of their sons, Albrecht Frederick and Friedrich Ernst, died at a young age. The family lived in a royal palace in Altenburg and continued to have an influential presence in the German Empire. Prince Albert was often involved in public affairs and even took on duties as the deputy of the duke on numerous occasions. Prince Albert passed away on June 22, 1902, at the age of 58, in Serrahn, Mecklenburg, Germany.

Description:
Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 – May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin. Albert was born in Munich as the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert was educated in Saxony and Vienna, focusing on military studies to prepare for a career in the Prussian army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert also studied in Leipzig and Geneva, broadening his horizons and focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. The couple had five children: Marie (1875-1938), Elisabeth (1865-1927), Margarete (1878-1962), Ernst (1871-1955), and Luise (1886-1979). Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family, and in 1882, Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Altenburg inherited the throne. Albert's relationship with his cousin, Ernst, was contentious due to disputes over the family estate and finances. As a result, Albert chose to live mainly outside of Saxe-Altenburg, residing in Switzerland, Munich, and eventually in Bamberg.

Despite his disagreements with his family, Prince Albert was known for his patronage of the arts and his interest in numismatics, or the study of coins, medals, and other forms of currency.

He was born on April 14, 1843 in Eisenberg, Saxe-Altenburg, and died on May 22, 1902 in Serrahn, Germany. Albert was the second son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Amalie of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. As a member of the ducal family, he held the style of Highness and the title of Prince of Saxe-Altenburg.

He later commanded the 2nd Regiment of Life Cuirassiers and saw active service during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871. On April 6, 1873, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia and Princess Maria Anne of Anhalt-Dessau. The couple had five children:

Description:
Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 – May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin. Albert was the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert was educated in Saxony and Vienna, focusing on military studies to prepare for a career in the army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert also studied in Leipzig and Geneva, focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. The couple had five children: Marie (1875-1938), Elisabeth (1865-1927), Margarete (1878-1962), Ernst (1871-1955), and Luise (1886-1979). Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family, and in 1882, Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Altenburg inherited the throne. Albert's relationship with his cousin, Ernst, was contentious due to disputes over the family estate and finances. As a result, Albert chose to live mainly outside of Saxe-Altenburg, residing in Switzerland, Munich, and eventually in Bamberg. Despite his disagreements with his family, Prince Albert was known for his patronage of the arts and his interest in numismatics, or the study of coins, medals, and other forms of currency. Additionally, he was considered a philanthropist, supporting various cultural and charitable causes.

Description:
Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 – May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin. Albert was the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert was educated in Saxony and Vienna, focusing on military studies to prepare for a career in the army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert also studied in Leipzig and Geneva, broadening his horizons and focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. The couple had five children: Marie (1875-1938), Elisabeth (1865-1927), Margarete (1878-1962), Ernst (1871-1955), and Luise (1886-1979). Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family, and in 1882, Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Altenburg inherited the throne.
