Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran, investigative journalist, and whistleblower. He is best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour served in the US Army from 1967 to 1968 as a helicopter gunner and door gunner. While in Vietnam, he heard about the atrocities committed by US soldiers at My Lai from fellow soldiers. He was deeply disturbed by these accounts and took it upon himself to investigate the matter further, gathering eyewitness accounts and evidence. In March 1969, after returning to the United States, Ridenhour wrote a detailed letter describing the massacre and sent copies of it to 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, urging them to conduct an investigation. His letter prompted an official inquiry which eventually led to the revelation of the massacre and its cover-up. The My Lai Massacre was a horrific event that took place on March 16, 1968, when US soldiers brutally killed between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and elderly people. The soldiers were part of a unit called the Charlie Company, led by Lieutenant William Calley. Following Ridenhour's effort to expose the massacre, Calley was court-martialed and convicted for his role in the event. The My Lai Massacre and its subsequent exposure fueled the growing anti-war sentiment in the United States and brought international attention to the atrocities committed by US forces in Vietnam. After leaving the Army, Ridenhour became an investigative journalist and an advocate in revealing and addressing other instances of wrongdoing by government and military officials. Over his career, he uncovered and reported stories related to political corruption, nuclear safety issues, and prison conditions. Ronald Ridenhour passed away on May 10, 1998, at the age of 52, due to a heart attack.

Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 12, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American investigative journalist, Vietnam War veteran, and whistleblower, best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its subsequent cover-up during the Vietnam War. He was serving as a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam when he first heard about the massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were brutally murdered by US soldiers on March 16, 1968. After returning from Vietnam, Ridenhour began an independent investigation into the event, interviewing soldiers who took part in or witnessed the massacre. In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai. His actions led to reports in the media and eventually to official investigations by the US military. The My Lai Massacre became a turning point in the Vietnam War, causing widespread outrage in the United States and internationally, and leading to a decline in support for the war among the American public. It also led to the prosecution of several high-ranking military officers, most notably, Lieutenant William Calley. Following his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, Ridenhour went on to become an investigative journalist, working for various news organizations and publications throughout his career. He also received the George Polk Award for his reporting on the My Lai Massacre. In 1989, the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Nation Institute established the annual Ridenhour Prizes in his honor. The prizes recognize acts of truth-telling, whistleblowing, and defending the public interest by journalists and other individuals who, like Ridenhour, display courage in their actions.

Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran, investigative journalist, and whistleblower. He is best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour served in the US Army from 1967 to 1968 as a helicopter gunner and door gunner. While in Vietnam, he heard about the atrocities committed by US soldiers at My Lai from fellow soldiers. He was deeply disturbed by these accounts and took it upon himself to investigate the matter further, gathering eyewitness accounts and evidence. In March 1969, after returning to the United States, Ridenhour wrote a detailed letter describing the massacre and sent copies of it to 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, urging them to conduct an investigation. His letter prompted an official inquiry which eventually led to the revelation of the massacre and its cover-up. The My Lai Massacre was a horrific event that took place on March 16, 1968, when US soldiers brutally killed between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and elderly people.

Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 12, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American investigative journalist, Vietnam War veteran, and whistleblower, best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its subsequent cover-up during the Vietnam War. He was serving as a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam when he first heard about the massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were brutally murdered by US soldiers on March 16, 1968. After returning from Vietnam, Ridenhour began an independent investigation into the event, interviewing soldiers who took part in or witnessed the massacre. In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai. His actions led to reports in the media and eventually to official investigations by the US military. The My Lai Massacre became a turning point in the Vietnam War, causing widespread outrage in the United States and internationally, and leading to a decline in support for the war among the American public. It also led to the prosecution of several high-ranking military officers, most notably, Lieutenant William Calley. Following his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, Ridenhour went on to become an investigative journalist, working for various news organizations and publications throughout his career.

Statement 1:
He also received the George Polk Award for his reporting on the My Lai Massacre.

Statement 2:
He received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in 1994 for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre.

Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran, investigative journalist, and whistleblower. He is best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour served in the US Army from 1967 to 1968 as a helicopter gunner and door gunner.

In March 1969, after returning to the United States, Ridenhour wrote a detailed letter describing the massacre and sent copies of it to 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, urging them to conduct an investigation. His letter prompted an official inquiry which eventually led to the revelation of the massacre and its cover-up. The My Lai Massacre was a horrific event that took place on March 16, 1968, when US soldiers brutally killed between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and elderly people.

After returning from Vietnam, Ridenhour began an independent investigation into the event, interviewing soldiers who took part in or witnessed the massacre. In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai.

The My Lai Massacre became a turning point in the Vietnam War, causing widespread outrage in the United States and internationally, and leading to a decline in support for the war among the American public. It also led to the prosecution of several high-ranking military officers, most notably, Lieutenant William Calley. Following his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, Ridenhour went on to become an investigative journalist, working for various news organizations and publications throughout his career. He also received the George Polk Award for his reporting on the My Lai Massacre. In 1989, the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Nation Institute established the annual Ridenhour Prizes in his honor. The prizes recognize acts of truth-telling, whistleblowing, and defending the public interest by journalists and other individuals who, like Ridenhour, display courage in their actions. Ronald Ridenhour died of a heart attack on May 10, 1998, at the age of 52.

In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai. His actions led to reports in the media and eventually to official investigations by the US military. The My Lai Massacre became a turning point in the Vietnam War, causing widespread outrage in the United States and internationally, and leading to a decline in support for the war among the American public. It also led to the prosecution of several high-ranking military officers, most notably, Lieutenant William Calley. Following his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, Ridenhour went on to become an investigative journalist, working for various news organizations and publications throughout his career. He also received the George Polk Award for his reporting on the My Lai Massacre. In 1989, the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Nation Institute established the annual Ridenhour Prizes in his honor.

Statement 1:
The prizes recognize acts of truth-telling, whistleblowing, and defending the public interest by journalists and other individuals who, like Ridenhour, display courage in their actions.

Statement 2:
The prizes recognize individuals or organizations that have demonstrated a commitment to advancing the truth and promoting social justice.

Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran and investigative journalist, best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. The massacre, which took place on March 16, 1968, involved US Army soldiers killing hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. Ridenhour served as a helicopter door gunner with the 11th Brigade, Americal Division, but he did not participate in the My Lai Massacre. He first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers while in Vietnam, and after returning to the United States, he began his own investigation. Ridenhour gathered testimonies from other soldiers who had either witnessed or participated in the events at My Lai. In March 1969, Ridenhour compiled his findings in a detailed letter and sent it to 30 government and military officials, including US President Richard Nixon, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and numerous congressmen. His letter prompted an official investigation, which eventually led to the court-martial and conviction of Army Lieutenant William L. Calley Jr. for his role in the massacre. Ridenhour's actions in uncovering the My Lai Massacre earned him praise for his commitment to the truth and for challenging the culture of secrecy within the military. He went on to have a successful career in journalism and investigative reporting.

Statement 1:
In 1991, Ridenhour co-founded The Fund for Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that supports investigative reporting.

Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran, investigative journalist, and whistleblower. He is best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour served in the US Army from 1967 to 1968 as a helicopter gunner and door gunner. While in Vietnam, he heard about the atrocities committed by US soldiers at My Lai from fellow soldiers. He was deeply disturbed by these accounts and took it upon himself to investigate the matter further, gathering eyewitness accounts and evidence. In March 1969, after returning to the United States, Ridenhour wrote a detailed letter describing the massacre and sent copies of it to 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, urging them to conduct an investigation. His letter prompted an official inquiry which eventually led to the revelation of the massacre and its cover-up. The My Lai Massacre was a horrific event that took place on March 16, 1968, when US soldiers brutally killed between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and elderly people. The soldiers were part of a unit called the Charlie Company, led by Lieutenant William Calley. Following Ridenhour's effort to expose the massacre, Calley was court-martialed and convicted for his role in the event. The My Lai Massacre and its subsequent exposure fueled the growing anti-war sentiment in the United States and brought international attention to the atrocities committed by US forces in Vietnam. After leaving the Army, Ridenhour became an investigative journalist and an advocate in revealing and addressing other instances of wrongdoing by government and military officials. Over his career, he uncovered and reported stories related to political corruption, nuclear safety issues, and prison conditions. Ronald Ridenhour passed away on May 10, 1998, at the age of 52, due to a heart attack. His legacy lives on through the annual Ridenhour Prizes, which are awarded to individuals who "demonstrate the courage to speak truth to power."

Statement 1:
These awards recognize whistleblowers, journalists, and activists who embody the same values and spirit that Ridenhour displayed throughout his life.

Ridenhour served as a helicopter door gunner with the 11th Brigade, Americal Division, but he did not participate in the My Lai Massacre. He first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers while in Vietnam, and after returning to the United States, he began his own investigation.

Description:
Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 12, 1946 – May 10, 1998) was an American investigative journalist, Vietnam War veteran, and whistleblower, best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its subsequent cover-up during the Vietnam War. He was serving as a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam when he first heard about the massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were brutally murdered by US soldiers on March 16, 1968. After returning from Vietnam, Ridenhour began an independent investigation into the event, interviewing soldiers who took part in or witnessed the massacre. In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai. His actions led to reports in the media and eventually to official investigations by the US military.

Statement 1:
The My Lai Massacre became a turning point in the Vietnam War, causing widespread outrage in the United States and internationally, and leading to a decline in support for the war among the American public.

Statement 2:
The Massacre became a turning point in the public's perception of the Vietnam War and led to increased opposition to the conflict.
