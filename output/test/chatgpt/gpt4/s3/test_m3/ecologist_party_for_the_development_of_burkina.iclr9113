The party is also concerned with issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. In general, the PEB adopts a pragmatic approach to politics, aiming to create a balance between the needs of the people and the long-term protection of the environment. The party's main goal is to achieve a harmonious relationship between the different components of the society (human beings, nature, and the economy) that allows for the sustainable development of Burkina Faso. Over the years, the party has participated in various national and regional elections. In the 2015 Burkina Faso general elections, the PEB fielded candidates for both the presidential and legislative races.
