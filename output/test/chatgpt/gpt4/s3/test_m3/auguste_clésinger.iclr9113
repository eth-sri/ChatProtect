Born in Besançon, France, to a Swiss sculptor named Jean-Baptiste Clésinger, Auguste went on to study under his father and fellow French sculptor David d'Angers. His works mainly feature subjects from ancient mythology, religious themes, and portrait sculptures. Auguste first gained recognition for his sculpture of a reclining Bacchante (1844) in the Louvre Museum. During his career, Clésinger created numerous bronze and marble sculptures which include busts, bas-reliefs, and decorative work. His most notable pieces include "Les Combat des Centares" ("The Fight of the Centaurs"), "Vénus Blessée" ("The Wounded Venus"), "Dalila," and "Le Faune"( "the Faun"). Apart from his career in sculpture, Auguste also painted several pictures in historical and modern subjects. As a sculptor, he was more successful and notable for his significant influence on the neoclassical movement. Personal life-wise, Clésinger married Romantic novelist George Sand's daughter, Solange Dudevant, in 1847, and through their marriage, Clésinger eventually developed a close relationship with Sand. Some controversies surround his work, particularly Clésinger's anatomical precision and realistic approach.

Due to the sensual nature of the work, it garnered much attention and incited intense debate on the appropriateness of such realism in art. Clésinger also dabbled in painting and created several notable pieces throughout his career, but he remained more renowned for his sculptural works. Some of his other famous works include the 'Bacchante' (1848) and the 'Femme au bain' (1864).

The marriage was troubled and short-lived, ending in a separation in 1850.

During his career, Clésinger created numerous bronze and marble sculptures which include busts, bas-reliefs, and decorative work. His most notable pieces include "Les Combat des Centares" ("The Fight of the Centaurs"), "Vénus Blessée" ("The Wounded Venus"), "Dalila," and "Le Faune"( "the Faun").

Description:
Auguste Clésinger (23 October 1814 – 5 January 1883) was a French sculptor and painter known for his romantic, sensuous, and controversial style. Born in Paris, he was the son of French sculptor Georges-Philippe Clésinger and started off studying under his father until he later entered the studio of Félix-Alexandre Desruelles. In 1843, Clésinger debuted his works at the Salon de Paris, an annual national exhibition by living artists. His early works included busts and portrait sculptures, but he gained most renown for his sensual female figures. One such example is his 1847 creation, "Woman Bitten by a Serpent", which caused a scandal due to its provocative posture and lifelike quality. The piece showcased a reclining nude woman with the serpent biting her ankle, resulting in a mix of shock and admiration from the public and critics. Auguste Clésinger then turned to painting, focusing on portraits and scenes of rural life.

Statement 1:
Additionally, he produced several monuments and busts of famous personalities, such as Honoré de Balzac and Napoleon I.

Auguste Clésinger (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter, best known for his sculptures, particularly for his realist and sensual works. This early exposure to art influenced Auguste Clésinger's decision to pursue a career in art. Auguste Clésinger studied sculpture in Paris under the renowned sculptor James Pradier. He gained recognition for his early sculptural works that demonstrated his realist style and ability to depict human emotions. His big breakthrough came in 1847 with his controversial sculpture ‘Woman Bitten by a Serpent,’ which depicted a nude female figure in the throes of suffering from a snakebite. Due to the sensual nature of the work, it garnered much attention and incited intense debate on the appropriateness of such realism in art. Clésinger also dabbled in painting and created several notable pieces throughout his career, but he remained more renowned for his sculptural works. He also created funeral monuments and homages to various historical figures, such as those for Prosper Mérimée, Théophile Gautier, and Madame Récamier. Apart from his artworks, Clésinger made headlines through his personal life as well. He married the daughter of the famous French novelist George Sand, Solange Dudevant, in 1847. The marriage was troubled and short-lived, ending in a separation in 1850. Clésinger continued to work and exhibit his art in the Salons in Paris throughout the subsequent years, experimenting with both classicism and realism in his sculptures. However, his later works did not achieve the same level of success or notoriety as his earlier pieces.

Description:
Auguste Clésinger (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter, best known for his sculptures, particularly for his realist and sensual works. Born in Besançon, France, on October 22, 1814, as Jean-Baptiste Auguste Clésinger, he was raised in an artistic environment as his father, Georges-Philippe Clésinger, was a successful painter. This early exposure to art influenced Auguste Clésinger's decision to pursue a career in art. Auguste Clésinger studied sculpture in Paris under the renowned sculptor James Pradier. He gained recognition for his early sculptural works that demonstrated his realist style and ability to depict human emotions. His big breakthrough came in 1847 with his controversial sculpture ‘Woman Bitten by a Serpent,’ which depicted a nude female figure in the throes of suffering from a snakebite. Due to the sensual nature of the work, it garnered much attention and incited intense debate on the appropriateness of such realism in art. Clésinger also dabbled in painting and created several notable pieces throughout his career, but he remained more renowned for his sculptural works. Some of his other famous works include the 'Bacchante' (1848) and the 'Femme au bain' (1864). He also created funeral monuments and homages to various historical figures, such as those for Prosper Mérimée, Théophile Gautier, and Madame Récamier. Apart from his artworks, Clésinger made headlines through his personal life as well. He married the daughter of the famous French novelist George Sand, Solange Dudevant, in 1847.

Statement 1:
The marriage was troubled and short-lived, ending in a separation in 1850.

Description:
Auguste Clésinger (23 October 1814 – 5 January 1883) was a French sculptor and painter known for his romantic, sensuous, and controversial style. Born in Paris, he was the son of French sculptor Georges-Philippe Clésinger and started off studying under his father until he later entered the studio of Félix-Alexandre Desruelles. In 1843, Clésinger debuted his works at the Salon de Paris, an annual national exhibition by living artists. His early works included busts and portrait sculptures, but he gained most renown for his sensual female figures. One such example is his 1847 creation, "Woman Bitten by a Serpent", which caused a scandal due to its provocative posture and lifelike quality. The piece showcased a reclining nude woman with the serpent biting her ankle, resulting in a mix of shock and admiration from the public and critics. Auguste Clésinger then turned to painting, focusing on portraits and scenes of rural life. Additionally, he produced several monuments and busts of famous personalities, such as Honoré de Balzac and Napoleon I. In his personal life, Clésinger was known for his spirited and passionate nature.

Statement 1:
In 1847, he married the novelist George Sand's daughter, Solange Dudevant.

Statement 2:
He married the writer George Sand in 1847.

A: The statements about Auguste Clésinger are contradictory. The first statement says that he married George Sand's daughter, Solange Dudevant, in 1847, while the second statement says that he married the writer George Sand in 1847. These cannot both be true, as they refer to two different people. George Sand was a pseudonym for the writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin, and she had a daughter named Solange, but the two women are not the same person. Therefore, the statements contradict each other.

Description:
Auguste Clésinger (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter famous for his works in neoclassical style. Born in Besançon, France, to a Swiss sculptor named Jean-Baptiste Clésinger, Auguste went on to study under his father and fellow French sculptor David d'Angers. His works mainly feature subjects from ancient mythology, religious themes, and portrait sculptures. Auguste first gained recognition for his sculpture of a reclining Bacchante (1844) in the Louvre Museum. During his career, Clésinger created numerous bronze and marble sculptures which include busts, bas-reliefs, and decorative work. His most notable pieces include "Les Combat des Centares" ("The Fight of the Centaurs"), "Vénus Blessée" ("The Wounded Venus"), "Dalila," and "Le Faune"( "the Faun"). Apart from his career in sculpture, Auguste also painted several pictures in historical and modern subjects. As a sculptor, he was more successful and notable for his significant influence on the neoclassical movement. Personal life-wise, Clésinger married Romantic novelist George Sand's daughter, Solange Dudevant, in 1847, and through their marriage, Clésinger eventually developed a close relationship with Sand. Some controversies surround his work, particularly Clésinger's anatomical precision and realistic approach.

Auguste Clésinger (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter, best known for his sculptures, particularly for his realist and sensual works. Born in Besançon, France, on October 22, 1814, as Jean-Baptiste Auguste Clésinger, he was raised in an artistic environment as his father, Georges-Philippe Clésinger, was a successful painter. This early exposure to art influenced Auguste Clésinger's decision to pursue a career in art. Auguste Clésinger studied sculpture in Paris under the renowned sculptor James Pradier. He gained recognition for his early sculptural works that demonstrated his realist style and ability to depict human emotions. His big breakthrough came in 1847 with his controversial sculpture ‘Woman Bitten by a Serpent,’ which depicted a nude female figure in the throes of suffering from a snakebite. Due to the sensual nature of the work, it garnered much attention and incited intense debate on the appropriateness of such realism in art.
