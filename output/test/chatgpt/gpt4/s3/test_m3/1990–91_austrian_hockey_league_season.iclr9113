Q: I give you the beginning of a description about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
The 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season was the 61st season of the Austrian Hockey League (also known as the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga or EBEL), the top professional ice hockey league in Austria, Central Europe.

Statement 1:
This season involved a total of eight participating teams, competing in a series of matches to determine the overall champion.

Please explain whether the statements about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory.

Therefore, the statements cannot both be true.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
The 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season was the 61st season of the top-level ice hockey league in Austria. It took place between September 1990 and March 1991. Eight teams participated in the league, including the defending champions VEU Feldkirch. After the regular season, the teams were divided into two groups for the final stage of the competition. In the final stage, the top four teams formed the upper play-off group and played six additional matches to determine the winner of the Austrian Championship.

Statement 1:
The bottom four teams formed the relegation group and played six additional matches to determine the final standings.

Statement 2:
The bottom four teams formed the lower play-off group and played six additional matches to determine the final standings of the season.

Please explain whether the statements about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the bottom four teams formed the relegation group, while Statement 2 claims that the bottom four teams formed the lower play-off group. These two groups have different purposes and outcomes. The relegation group is typically formed to determine which teams will be relegated to a lower league, while the lower play-off group is formed to determine the final standings of the season. Therefore, it is not possible for the same group of teams to be both in the relegation group and the lower play-off group.

Then follow two statements.

Description:
The 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season was the 61st season of the professional ice hockey league in Austria. This league, known as the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga (EBEL) due to sponsorship reasons, featured 10 teams that competed for the national championship title. The teams played a total of 46 games during the regular season, which began in September 1990 and concluded in March 1990. The ten teams participating in the season were:

1. EC KAC
2. EC Salzburg
3. EC VSV
4. EHC Innsbruck
5. EV Wien
6. EHC Feldkirch
7. EC Graz
8. ATSV Zeltweg
9. EHC Lustenau
10. HC Wacker

At the end of the regular season, the top six teams qualified for the playoffs, while the bottom four teams competed in the relegation round to determine which team would be relegated to the lower tier of Austrian ice hockey. In the playoffs, the teams competed in a best-of-seven series for the championship title. EC KAC, which finished the regular season at the top of the table, went on to win the championship title by defeating EC VSV in the final series with a 4-1 victory.

Statement 1:
EHC Lustenau finished last in the relegation round and was relegated to the Austrian National League.

Statement 2:
EHC Lustenau finished in 9th place in the regular season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the lower tier of Austrian ice hockey.

Please explain whether the statements about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that EHC Lustenau was relegated to the Austrian National League after finishing last in the relegation round, while Statement 2 states that EHC Lustenau narrowly avoided relegation by finishing in 9th place in the regular season. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as one claims that EHC Lustenau was relegated and the other claims that they were not. Therefore, they are contradictory.

In the playoff stage, the semifinals pitted VEU Feldkirch against Innsbrucker EV and EC KAC against EC Graz 99ers.

Statement 1:
VEU Feldkirch and EC KAC emerged victorious, reaching the finals to determine the league champion.

Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. 

Statement 1 suggests that both VEU Feldkirch and EC KAC reached the finals to determine the league champion, while Statement 2 suggests that they emerged victorious in the semifinals to advance to the championship game. 

If Statement 1 were true, it would mean that the semifinals were skipped, and both teams automatically advanced to the finals. However, Statement 2 indicates that there were indeed semifinals, and VEU Feldkirch and EC KAC won their respective matches to advance to the championship game.

Description:
The 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season was the 61st season of the top-level ice hockey league in Austria. It took place between September 1990 and March 1991. Eight teams participated in the league, including the defending champions VEU Feldkirch. The regular season consisted of a round-robin format with each team playing each other twice, resulting in a total of 14 games for each team. After the regular season, the teams were divided into two groups for the final stage of the competition. In the final stage, the top four teams formed the upper play-off group and played six additional matches to determine the winner of the Austrian Championship. The bottom four teams formed the relegation group and played six additional matches to determine which team would be relegated to the second-tier league.

Statement 1:
In the upper play-off group, EC KAC emerged as the winners of the championship, defeating SC Feldkirch, EC Graz, and Wiener EV to claim their 20th league title.

Statement 2:
EC KAC emerged as the champions of the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season, winning their 25th title in the league's history.

Please explain whether the statements about 1990–91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.
