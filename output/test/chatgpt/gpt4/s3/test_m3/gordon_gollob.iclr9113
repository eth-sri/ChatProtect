Born in Vienna, Austria, he was one of the most successful fighter pilots in the German Luftwaffe and is credited with 150 aerial victories. Gollob began his military career by joining the Austrian Army in 1930 but later transferred to the Austrian Air Force. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, he joined the German Luftwaffe and was trained as a fighter pilot. During the early stages of World War II, Gollob participated in the invasion of Poland and the Battle of Britain. However, he achieved his greatest successes in the Eastern Front, where he claimed the majority of his aerial victories while flying with the celebrated Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) fighter wing. In 1942, Gollob reached the remarkable milestone of 150 victories, becoming the first Luftwaffe pilot to do so. In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds – one of the highest military decorations in Nazi Germany. Gollob was promoted to the rank of Oberst (Colonel) in 1943, becoming the youngest General Officer in the Luftwaffe at just 30 years old.

Gordon Gollob (1912–1987) was an Austrian fighter pilot and military officer during World War II, who later served in the post-war Austrian Air Force. Born on June 26, 1912, in Vienna, Austria, Gollob joined the Austrian military in 1930 and after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, he was transferred to the German Luftwaffe. Gollob served as a fighter pilot during the early stages of World War II and participated in the Battle of Britain, the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), and several other military engagements. He achieved great success and recognition as a skilled pilot, ultimately becoming one of the top-scoring fighter aces of the war. Gollob was credited with 150 aerial victories in over 340 combat missions, earning him numerous awards and decorations, including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds – one of the highest military awards of Nazi Germany. In addition to his combat duties, Gollob also held various command positions within the Luftwaffe, ultimately being promoted to the rank of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) in 1943. In 1944, he was appointed as the Inspector of Day Fighters (Jagdflieger) in the Luftwaffe High Command (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) under Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. However, in the closing months of the war, he fell out of favor with Göring, leading to his dismissal from this position.

However, he achieved his greatest successes in the Eastern Front, where he claimed the majority of his aerial victories while flying with the celebrated Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) fighter wing. In 1942, Gollob reached the remarkable milestone of 150 victories, becoming the first Luftwaffe pilot to do so. In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds – one of the highest military decorations in Nazi Germany. Gollob was promoted to the rank of Oberst (Colonel) in 1943, becoming the youngest General Officer in the Luftwaffe at just 30 years old. He took on various commanding roles, including leadership of the 3rd Fighter Division and Inspector of Day Fighters. In 1944, he was appointed General of Fighter Aircraft, overseeing all German fighters on the Eastern Front. When the war ended, Gollob was taken prisoner by British forces and was released in 1947. Gordon Gollob retired from military service after World War II and settled back in Austria. He worked as an engineer and later as a representative for an American electronics company. He passed away in September 1987 in Baden, Austria. Throughout his career, Gordon Gollob was respected for his tactical knowledge, leadership skills, and exceptional prowess as a fighter pilot.

Description:
Gordon Gollob (5 June 1912 – 7 September 1987) was an Austrian World War II flying ace and high-ranking officer in the Luftwaffe. He joined the Austrian military at an early age. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gollob transferred to the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) and underwent flight training. During World War II, Gollob rose quickly through the ranks and acquired a reputation as an exceptional pilot. He notably scored 150 aerial victories in 340 combat missions, making him the 17th most successful fighter pilot in the history of the Luftwaffe. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his extraordinary achievements, becoming the first fighter pilot ever to be awarded the Diamonds (the highest grade of the Knight's Cross). Gollob was promoted several times during the war, ultimately reaching the rank of Generalleutnant (Major General) and was placed in charge of special functions, including training and promotions within the Luftwaffe. In this role, he was responsible for many innovations to improve fighter pilot training, tactics, and organization. After the war, Gollob was briefly interned by the Allies and later released. Due to his military status, he was not able to have a part in the rebuilding of the Austrian Air Force post-war.

Gordon Gollob (June 26, 1912 – September 7, 1987) was an Austrian fighter ace and military officer during World War II. Born in Vienna, Austria, he was one of the most successful fighter pilots in the German Luftwaffe and is credited with 150 aerial victories. Gollob began his military career by joining the Austrian Army in 1930 but later transferred to the Austrian Air Force. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, he joined the German Luftwaffe and was trained as a fighter pilot. During the early stages of World War II, Gollob participated in the invasion of Poland and the Battle of Britain. However, he achieved his greatest successes in the Eastern Front, where he claimed the majority of his aerial victories while flying with the celebrated Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) fighter wing. In 1942, Gollob reached the remarkable milestone of 150 victories, becoming the first Luftwaffe pilot to do so. In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds – one of the highest military decorations in Nazi Germany.

Description:
Gordon Gollob (1912–1987) was an Austrian fighter pilot and military officer during World War II, who later served in the post-war Austrian Air Force. Born on June 26, 1912, in Vienna, Austria, Gollob joined the Austrian military in 1930 and after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, he was transferred to the German Luftwaffe. Gollob served as a fighter pilot during the early stages of World War II and participated in the Battle of Britain, the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), and several other military engagements. He achieved great success and recognition as a skilled pilot, ultimately becoming one of the top-scoring fighter aces of the war. Gollob was credited with 150 aerial victories in over 340 combat missions, earning him numerous awards and decorations, including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds – one of the highest military awards of Nazi Germany. In addition to his combat duties, Gollob also held various command positions within the Luftwaffe, ultimately being promoted to the rank of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) in 1943. In 1944, he was appointed as the Inspector of Day Fighters (Jagdflieger) in the Luftwaffe High Command (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) under Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. However, in the closing months of the war, he fell out of favor with Göring, leading to his dismissal from this position.

He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his extraordinary achievements, becoming the first fighter pilot ever to be awarded the Diamonds (the highest grade of the Knight's Cross).

In this role, he was responsible for many innovations to improve fighter pilot training, tactics, and organization. After the war, Gollob was briefly interned by the Allies and later released.

Gordon Gollob (June 26, 1912 – September 7, 1987) was an Austrian fighter ace and military officer during World War II. Born in Vienna, Austria, he was one of the most successful fighter pilots in the German Luftwaffe and is credited with 150 aerial victories. Gollob later transferred to the Austrian Air Force.

Description:
Gordon Gollob (5 June 1912 – 7 September 1987) was an Austrian World War II flying ace and high-ranking officer in the Luftwaffe. He was born in Vienna and joined the Austrian military at an early age. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gollob transferred to the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) and underwent flight training. During World War II, Gollob rose quickly through the ranks and acquired a reputation as an exceptional pilot. He notably scored 150 aerial victories in 340 combat missions, making him the 17th most successful fighter pilot in the history of the Luftwaffe. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his extraordinary achievements, becoming the first fighter pilot ever to be awarded the Diamonds (the highest grade of the Knight's Cross). Gollob was promoted several times during the war, ultimately reaching the rank of Generalleutnant (Major General) and was placed in charge of special functions, including training and promotions within the Luftwaffe. In this role, he was responsible for many innovations to improve fighter pilot training, tactics, and organization. After the war, Gollob was briefly interned by the Allies and later released.

Statement 1:
Due to his military status, he was not able to have a part in the rebuilding of the Austrian Air Force post-war.

Statement 2:
He was not able to have a successful career in aviation after the war due to his association with the Nazi regime.

Please explain whether the statements about gordon gollob are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. Statement 2 suggests that Gollob's association with the Nazi regime hindered his post-war career in aviation, while Statement 1 simply states that he was not able to participate in the rebuilding of the Austrian Air Force due to his military status. These statements do not contradict each other.
