Description:
Shlomo Molla (born 1965) is an Ethiopian-born Israeli politician who made history as the first Ethiopian-Jewish immigrant to become a member of Israel's parliament, the Knesset. Born in Gondar, Ethiopia, Molla was part of the Beta Israel community, a group of Ethiopian Jews. In the early 1980s, he made a dangerous journey on foot to Sudan in order to reach Israel as a part of Operation Moses – an Israeli initiative to rescue Ethiopian Jews from the region's civil war and the harsh regime that discriminated against them. Molla arrived in Israel in 1984 and became a member of the Zionist youth movement, Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed, which led him to complete his education and participate in anti-racism activism. In 1999, he earned his bachelor's degree in social work and public administration from the University of Haifa. Molla joined the Israeli political party, Kadima, and in 2006, he won a seat on the party's list for the Knesset elections. He served as a member of the Knesset from 2008 to 2013, working on various committees, including the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Labor, Welfare, and Health Committee, and the Immigration, Absorption, and Diaspora Affairs Committee. During his tenure, Molla focused on addressing social and economic issues affecting the Ethiopian-Israeli community and promoting racial equality within Israel. In addition to his political career, Molla is a social activist who has used his voice to fight discrimination and promote social justice in Israel. He served as the deputy director of world WIZO (Women's International Zionist Organization), focusing on education and welfare issues. After leaving the Knesset, he founded the Facebook group "Israel Marching for Equality" in 2017, advocating for justice and equal opportunities for all Israelis.
