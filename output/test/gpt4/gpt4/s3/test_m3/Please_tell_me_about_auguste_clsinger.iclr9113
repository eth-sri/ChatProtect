{"Q": "I give you the beginning of a description about auguste cl\u00e9singer.\nThen follow two statements.\n\nDescription:\nA French sculptor and painter, Auguste Cl\u00e9singer, is known for his depictions of mythological figures. Born in Paris, he was the son of French sculptor Georges-Philippe Cl\u00e9singer and started off studying under his father until he later entered the studio of F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Desruelles. In 1843, Cl\u00e9singer showcased his works at the Salon de Paris, an annual national exhibition by living artists. His early works included busts and portrait sculptures, but he gained most renown for his sensual female figures. One such example is his 1847 creation, \"Woman Bitten by a Serpent\", which caused a scandal due to its provocative posture and lifelike quality. The piece showcased a reclining nude woman with the serpent biting her ankle, resulting in a mix of shock and admiration from the public and critics. Auguste Cl\u00e9singer then turned to painting, focusing on portraits and scenes of rural life. Additionally, he produced several monuments and busts of famous personalities, such as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and Napoleon I. In his personal life, Cl\u00e9singer was known for his spirited and passionate nature.\n\nStatement 1:\nIn 1847, he married George Sand's daughter, Solange Dudevant.\n\nStatement 2:\nHe married the writer George Sand's daughter, Solange.\n\nPlease explain whether the statements about auguste cl\u00e9singer are contradictory.\nProvide your explanation only.\n", "A": ["The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory.
