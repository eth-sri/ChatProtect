Q: I give you the beginning of a description about Bailey–Thompson House.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
The Bailey–Thompson House is a historic house located in South Boston, Virginia, United States. This two-story, Federal-style brick house was built in 1820 for Gabriel Bailey, a prominent member of the community who served as a state delegate, senator, and U.S. Congressman. The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns. The façade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building.

Statement 1:
In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who added the rear wings and enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade.

Statement 2:
George L. Thompson added a two-story rear wing to the Bailey-Thompson House in the late 19th century.

Please explain whether the statements about Bailey–Thompson House are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

However, 1907 is close enough to the late 19th century that it could be considered a minor discrepancy rather than a contradiction.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about Bailey–Thompson House.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
The Bailey–Thompson House is a historic house located in South Boston, Virginia, United States. This two-story, Federal-style brick house was built in 1820 for Gabriel Bailey, a prominent member of the community who served as a state delegate, senator, and U.S. Congressman. The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns. The façade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who added the rear wings and enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade. His descendants occupied the house until 1968. In 1970, the Bailey–Thompson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historical significance as an example of Federal-style architecture and its association with Gabriel Bailey and George L. Thompson.

Description:
The Bailey–Thompson House is a historic house located in South Boston, Virginia, United States. This two-story, Federal-style brick house was built in 1820 for Gabriel Bailey, a prominent member of the community who served as a state delegate, senator, and U.S. Congressman. The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns. The façade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who added the rear wings and enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade. His descendants occupied the house until 1968. In 1970, the Bailey–Thompson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historical significance as an example of Federal-style architecture and its association with Gabriel Bailey and George L.

Description:
The Bailey–Thompson House is a historic house located in South Boston, Virginia, United States.

The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns. The façade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who added the rear wings and enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade. His descendants occupied the house until 1968. In 1970, the Bailey–Thompson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historical significance as an example of Federal-style architecture and its association with Gabriel Bailey and George L.
