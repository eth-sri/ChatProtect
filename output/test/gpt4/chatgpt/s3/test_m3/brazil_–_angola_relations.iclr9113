Brazil is Angola's second-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $3 billion in 2019.

However, there have also been controversies in the Brazil-Angola relationship, mainly related to corruption and money-laundering. Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which has been implicated in corruption scandals across Latin America, has been accused of bribing Angolan officials to secure contracts. In 2019, the Brazilian government froze $30 million in assets linked to an Angolan businesswoman accused of corruption.
