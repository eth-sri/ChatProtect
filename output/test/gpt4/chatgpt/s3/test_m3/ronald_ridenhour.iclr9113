Q: I give you the beginning of a description about ronald ridenhour.
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Ronald Ridenhour was a Vietnam War veteran and a former helicopter door gunner who became a journalist after leaving the military. He is best known for his role in uncovering the My Lai massacre, a mass killing of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by United States Army soldiers during the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Ridenhour heard about the massacre and was disturbed by what he had heard. He began to investigate the incident, collecting information from fellow veterans and conducting interviews with survivors and witnesses. He compiled a detailed report about the massacre and sent it to members of Congress, the Pentagon, and the media. Ridenhour's efforts helped to expose the My Lai massacre to the public, resulting in a scandal that rocked the US military and government. His report led to investigations, court-martials, and the eventual conviction of several soldiers involved in the massacre.

Statement 1:
Ridenhour continued to work as a journalist and activist after the Vietnam War, focusing on issues related to government accountability and social justice.

Statement 2:
Ridenhour continued to work as a journalist and activist, advocating for peace and justice and speaking out against war crimes and government corruption.
