Q: I give you the beginning of a description about Perseus (constellation).
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Perseus is a northern constellation located between Andromeda and Auriga. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is famous for beheading the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation was first documented by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus contains several notable objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known as the "Demon Star" due to its fluctuating brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster that is home to thousands of individual galaxies. One of the most intriguing objects in Perseus is the nebula known as NGC 1333. This cloud of gas and dust is a stellar nursery, where new stars are being born. It is estimated that there are over 700 young stars in NGC 1333, all of which are less than a million years old. Perseus is also home to several other interesting stars, such as Mirfak, which is a bright white star that is much larger and hotter than the Sun.

Statement 1:
Another notable star in Perseus is Menkib, which is a blue supergiant that is over 30 times more massive than the Sun.

Statement 2:
Menkib is more massive than Mirfak.

Please explain whether the statements about Perseus (constellation) are contradictory.
Provide your explanation only.

A: The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about Menkib, stating that it is a blue supergiant and over 30 times more massive than the Sun.

Description:
Perseus is a northern constellation located between Andromeda and Auriga. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is famous for beheading the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation was first documented by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus contains several notable objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known as the "Demon Star" due to its fluctuating brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster that is home to thousands of individual galaxies. One of the most intriguing objects in Perseus is the nebula known as NGC 1333. This cloud of gas and dust is a stellar nursery, where new stars are being born. It is estimated that there are over 700 young stars in NGC 1333, all of which are less than a million years old. Perseus is also home to several other interesting stars, such as Mirfak, which is a bright white star that is much larger and hotter than the Sun. Another notable star in Perseus is Menkib, which is a blue supergiant that is over 30 times more massive than the Sun. Overall, Perseus is a fascinating constellation that is rich in interesting objects and celestial phenomena.

Description:
Perseus is a northern constellation located between Andromeda and Auriga. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is famous for beheading the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation was first documented by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus contains several notable objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known as the "Demon Star" due to its fluctuating brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster that is home to thousands of individual galaxies. One of the most intriguing objects in Perseus is the nebula known as NGC 1333. This cloud of gas and dust is a stellar nursery, where new stars are being born. It is estimated that there are over 700 young stars in NGC 1333, all of which are less than a million years old. Perseus is also home to several other interesting stars, such as Mirfak, which is a bright white star that is much larger and hotter than the Sun.

Statement 1:
Another notable star in Perseus is Menkib, which is a blue supergiant that is over 30 times more massive than the Sun.

Q: I give you the beginning of a description about Perseus (constellation).
Then follow two statements.

Description:
Perseus is a northern constellation located between Andromeda and Auriga. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is famous for beheading the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation was first documented by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus contains several notable objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known as the "Demon Star" due to its fluctuating brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster that is home to thousands of individual galaxies. One of the most intriguing objects in Perseus is the nebula known as NGC 1333. This cloud of gas and dust is a stellar nursery, where new stars are being born. It is estimated that there are over 700 young stars in NGC 1333, all of which are less than a million years old. Perseus is also home to several other interesting stars, such as Mirfak, which is a bright white star that is much larger and hotter than the Sun. Another notable star in Perseus is Menkib, which is a blue supergiant that is over 30 times more massive than the Sun. Overall, Perseus is a fascinating constellation that is rich in interesting objects and celestial phenomena.

Statement 1:
Its mythology and history have captured the imaginations of people for centuries, and continue to inspire wonder and fascination in modern times.

Statement 2:
Its mythology and history have captured the imagination of people for thousands of years, and it continues to be an important part of astronomy and culture today.

Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It was named after the mythological Greek hero Perseus, who was famous for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is located northwest of Cassiopeia, northeast of Andromeda, and east of Camelopardalis. Perseus contains many interesting deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye. Other notable objects include NGC 869 and NGC 884, two bright nebulae that are also part of the double cluster. One of the most famous objects in Perseus is the variable star Algol, which represents the eye of Medusa. Algol is actually a binary star system where two stars orbit around each other, blocking each other's light in a regular cycle, causing the star to appear to dim and brighten.

Statement 1:
Perseus is also associated with several meteor showers, including the Perseids, which occur each year in August and are one of the most popular meteor showers for stargazers.
