During World War II, Gollob became one of the most successful fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe. He was credited with shooting down 150 enemy planes, making him the third-highest scoring German ace of the war. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military honor in Germany at the time.

In 1942, Gollob was promoted to the rank of Major and was given command of JG 77, a fighter wing. He led his wing in many successful missions, including the defense of Sicily and the Battle of Kursk. However, Gollob's career was cut short in 1944 when he was injured in a flying accident. He was forced to retire from active service and spent the rest of the war working as a test pilot.
