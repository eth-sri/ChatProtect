  "text": "The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on April 6, 1944, in the Philippines, under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita. The army was tasked with defending the Philippines against the Allied forces, which were advancing towards the islands.\n\nThe Thirty-First Army was composed of several divisions, including the 14th Army, the 35th Army, and the 100th Division. The army was also supported by naval and air units.\n\nThe army's first major engagement was the Battle of Leyte, which began on October 20, 1944. The army was able to hold off the Allied forces for several weeks, but eventually, they were forced to retreat to the mountains. The army suffered heavy losses during the battle, with over 50,000 soldiers killed or captured.\n\nAfter the Battle of Leyte, the Thirty-First Army was reorganized and sent to defend Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines. The army was able to hold off the Allied forces for several months, but they were eventually defeated in the Battle of Luzon, which began on January 9, 1945.\n\nThe Thirty-First Army was disbanded on August 15, 1945, following Japan's surrender. General Yamashita was later tried and executed for war crimes committed by his troops during the war.",
