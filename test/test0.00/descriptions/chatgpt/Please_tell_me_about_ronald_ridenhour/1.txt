  "text": "Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed.\n\nRidenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from fellow soldiers who had been involved. Shocked and appalled by what he had heard, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and gathering evidence. He wrote letters to government officials, including President Nixon, detailing what had happened and calling for an investigation.\n\nRidenhour's efforts eventually led to a full investigation of the My Lai Massacre, and several soldiers were charged and convicted of war crimes. Ridenhour's bravery and dedication to justice helped to expose the truth about the massacre and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.\n\nAfter the war, Ridenhour became an investigative journalist and continued to speak out against war crimes and government corruption. He died in 1998 at the age of 52.",
