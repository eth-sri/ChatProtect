  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican preacher and evangelist who played a significant role in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 18th century. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University, where he became a member of the Holy Club, a group of devout students led by John Wesley. Whitefield became known for his powerful preaching style, which emphasized the need for personal conversion and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Wales, preaching to large crowds in open fields and marketplaces. He also made several trips to America, where he preached in cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.",
