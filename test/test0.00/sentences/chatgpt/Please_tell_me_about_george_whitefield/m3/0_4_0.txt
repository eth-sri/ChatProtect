He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University, where he became a member of the Holy Club, a group of devout students led by John Wesley. Whitefield became known for his powerful preaching style, which emphasized the need for personal conversion and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Wales, preaching to large crowds in open fields and marketplaces.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he made several trips to America and preached in cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that he also did other things in America, while statement 2 focuses solely on his preaching. However, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
