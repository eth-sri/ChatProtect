  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize Whitefield's focus on personal conversion and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The only difference is in the wording used to describe this emphasis. Statement 1 mentions Whitefield's powerful preaching style, while Statement 2 emphasizes the importance of a personal relationship with God. However, both statements ultimately convey the same message about Whitefield's beliefs and teachings."
