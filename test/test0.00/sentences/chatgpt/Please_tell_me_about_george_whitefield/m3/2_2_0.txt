  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both describe his powerful preaching style and the impact it had on his audiences, emphasizing the importance of personal conversion and faith in Jesus Christ. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions the large crowds he drew and the conversions he inspired, while statement 1 focuses more on the content of his preaching. However, both statements are consistent with the overall description of Whitefield as a significant figure in the Great Awakening."
