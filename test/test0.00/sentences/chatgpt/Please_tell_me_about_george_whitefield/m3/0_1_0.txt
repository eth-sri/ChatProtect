  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about his background and involvement with the Holy Club at Oxford University. The first statement mentions that he was a member of the group, while the second statement adds that he actually led the group. Both statements support the idea that Whitefield was deeply committed to his faith and actively involved in religious communities from a young age."
