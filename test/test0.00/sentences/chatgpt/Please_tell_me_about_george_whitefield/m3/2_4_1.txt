They both provide additional information about his preaching and evangelism, with statement 1 specifically mentioning his travels to America and statement 2 highlighting his impact on the religious revival in the American colonies. Both statements are consistent with the overall description of Whitefield as a prominent figure in the Great Awakening and a powerful preacher who drew large crowds."
