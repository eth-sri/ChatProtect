  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican preacher and evangelist who played a significant role in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 18th century. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University, where he became a member of the Holy Club, a group of devout students led by John Wesley. Whitefield became known for his powerful preaching style, which emphasized the need for personal conversion and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Wales, preaching to large crowds in open fields and marketplaces. He also made several trips to America, where he preached in cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Whitefield's preaching had a profound impact on the American colonies, helping to spark a wave of religious enthusiasm that led to the founding of new churches and the growth of existing ones. He also played a key role in the development of the Methodist movement, which was founded by John Wesley. Despite his popularity, Whitefield was not without controversy. He was criticized by some for his emotional preaching style and his willingness to challenge established religious authorities. He also owned slaves, which has led to criticism of his legacy in modern times. Whitefield died in Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1770, at the age of 55.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his significant role as a preacher and evangelist during the Great Awakening and his impact on the development of Christianity in America and evangelical Christianity in general. The only difference is that statement 2 broadens the scope to include his influence beyond America."
