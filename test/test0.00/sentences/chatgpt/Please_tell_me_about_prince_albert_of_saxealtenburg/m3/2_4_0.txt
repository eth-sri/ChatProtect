  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he served as a general in the Prussian army, but only the first statement adds that he fought in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Therefore, the second statement is simply a repetition of information already provided in the text."
