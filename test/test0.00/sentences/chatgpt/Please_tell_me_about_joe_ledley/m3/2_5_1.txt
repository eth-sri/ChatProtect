  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Joe Ledley's career, specifically his involvement with the Welsh national team and their success in the Euro 2016 tournament. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the fact that Ledley has earned over 80 caps for the national team, while statement 2 simply mentions that he played in the tournament. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Ledley as a key player for Wales."
