Statement 1 mentions Ledley's key role in Wales' historic run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016, while Statement 2 provides a broader overview of his international career, mentioning his participation in both the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. Both statements are true and complement each other, rather than contradicting each other."
