  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory, as they both describe the army's retreat from Leyte after facing heavy losses. The first statement provides additional information about the duration of the army's defense before retreating, while the second statement focuses on the cause of the retreat. Both statements are consistent with the historical record of the Thirty-First Army's actions during the Battle of Leyte."
