  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the army suffered heavy losses or casualties during the Battle of Leyte. The only difference is in the choice of words used to describe the losses. \"Losses\" in statement 1 refers to soldiers killed or captured, while \"casualties\" in statement 2 refers to soldiers killed, wounded, or missing in action."
