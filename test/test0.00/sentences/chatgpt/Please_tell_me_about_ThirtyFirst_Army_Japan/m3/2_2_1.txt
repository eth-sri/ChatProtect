  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the army was formed to defend the Philippines against the advancing Allied forces during World War II. The only difference is in the wording and sentence structure. Statement 1 emphasizes the task assigned to the army, while Statement 2 emphasizes the army's role in defending the Philippines."
