  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. The first statement states that the army was formed in the Philippines, while the second statement states that it was formed in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies. These are two different locations, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
