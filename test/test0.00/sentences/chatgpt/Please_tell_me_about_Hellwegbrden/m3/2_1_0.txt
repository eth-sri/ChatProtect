  "explanation": "The two statements about Hellwegb\u00f6rden are not contradictory. They both provide the same information about the region's location, stating that it is situated between the Sauerland mountains to the east and the M\u00fcnsterland region to the west. The only difference is that the second statement omits the word \"region\" after M\u00fcnsterland."
