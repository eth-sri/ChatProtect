  "explanation": "The statements about Hellwegb\u00f6rden are not contradictory. Both statements mention Soest as a notable town in the region and highlight its well-preserved medieval architecture. The only difference is that statement 2 also mentions the historic city center of Soest. However, this does not contradict statement 1 as it is still true that Soest was once an important trading center and has well-preserved medieval architecture."
