Today, Brazil is one of Angola's largest trading partners and has significant investments in the country's oil and gas sector. In recent years, the two countries have strengthened their ties through various initiatives, including the establishment of a joint commission for economic cooperation and the signing of several bilateral agreements in areas such as education, health, and agriculture. Brazil has also provided technical assistance to Angola in areas such as infrastructure development, renewable energy, and public administration.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about Brazil's efforts to strengthen cultural and educational ties with Angola, while Statement 2 simply reiterates the fact that Brazil has offered scholarships to Angolan students. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Brazil and Angola have a strong relationship that extends beyond economic cooperation."
