  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides historical context, stating that the relationship between the two countries dates back to the 16th century when they were both colonized by Portugal. Statement 2 further explains that the shared history and language between Brazil and Angola, both former Portuguese colonies, contributed to the establishment of their relationship. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a comprehensive understanding of the historical and cultural ties between Brazil and Angola."
