Today, Brazil is one of Angola's largest trading partners and has significant investments in the country's oil and gas sector. In recent years, the two countries have strengthened their ties through various initiatives, including the establishment of a joint commission for economic cooperation and the signing of several bilateral agreements in areas such as education, health, and agriculture. Brazil has also provided technical assistance to Angola in areas such as infrastructure development, renewable energy, and public administration. Additionally, Brazil has offered scholarships to Angolan students to study in Brazilian universities, further strengthening the cultural and educational ties between the two nations. Despite the positive relationship, there have been some tensions between Brazil and Angola in recent years. In 2019, Angola cancelled a $1 billion contract with Brazilian construction company Odebrecht due to corruption allegations.",
