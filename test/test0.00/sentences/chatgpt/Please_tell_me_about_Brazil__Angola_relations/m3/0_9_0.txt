  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long-standing relationship that dates back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers established a presence in both countries. Today, Brazil is one of Angola's largest trading partners and has significant investments in the country's oil and gas sector. In recent years, the two countries have strengthened their ties through various initiatives, including the establishment of a joint commission for economic cooperation and the signing of several bilateral agreements in areas such as agriculture, education, and culture. Brazil has also provided technical assistance to Angola in areas such as healthcare and infrastructure development. In 2019, Brazil announced a $2 billion credit line to Angola to support the country's economic development. However, the relationship between the two countries has not been without its challenges. In 2017, Brazil temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Angolan citizens due to a high number of visa applications and concerns over illegal immigration. The move strained relations between the two countries, but the issue was eventually resolved. Overall, Brazil and Angola have a complex and multifaceted relationship that is characterized by both cooperation and competition.",
