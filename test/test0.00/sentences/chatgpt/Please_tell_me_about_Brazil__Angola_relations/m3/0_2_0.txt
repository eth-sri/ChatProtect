  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention the strengthening of ties between the two countries in recent years, but they highlight different areas of cooperation. Statement 1 mentions the establishment of a joint commission for economic cooperation and the signing of bilateral agreements in various areas, while Statement 2 specifically mentions cooperation in agriculture, education, and healthcare. Both statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive overview of the current state of Brazil-Angola relations."
