  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. They both state that the relationship between the two countries dates back to the 16th century when the Portuguese colonized both Brazil and Angola. The only difference is in the wording and structure of the sentences. Statement 1 provides more detail about the relationship being long-standing, while Statement 2 is more concise and straightforward. Overall, both statements support the idea that Brazil and Angola have a historical connection through their shared colonial past."
