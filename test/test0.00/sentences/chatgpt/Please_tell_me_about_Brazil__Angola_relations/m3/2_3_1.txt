  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Brazil has provided technical assistance to Angola in the areas of infrastructure development and public administration. However, statement 1 adds that Brazil has also provided technical assistance in renewable energy, while statement 2 does not mention this specific area. Therefore, the statements provide slightly different information but do not contradict each other."
