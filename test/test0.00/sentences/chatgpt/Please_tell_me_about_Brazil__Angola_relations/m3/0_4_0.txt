  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight Brazil's commitment to supporting Angola's economic development and infrastructure. The first statement mentions a $2 billion credit line that Brazil announced in 2019 to support Angola's economic development, while the second statement mentions Brazil's plans to increase its investment in Angola's infrastructure, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy. Both statements demonstrate Brazil's continued efforts to strengthen its relationship with Angola and support its growth and development."
