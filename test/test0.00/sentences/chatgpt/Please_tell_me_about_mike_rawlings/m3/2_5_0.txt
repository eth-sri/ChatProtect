  "explanation": "The statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he served as the CEO of the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau from 2003 to 2004, while statement 2 says that he served in that role from 2003 to 2011. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different time frames for Rawlings' tenure as CEO of the bureau."
