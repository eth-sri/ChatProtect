  "explanation": "The two statements about Mike Rawlings are not contradictory. They both state that he did not seek re-election for a third term as mayor in 2019. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that he was re-elected in 2015, while statement 2 does not provide that information. However, this does not change the fact that he did not seek re-election in 2019."
