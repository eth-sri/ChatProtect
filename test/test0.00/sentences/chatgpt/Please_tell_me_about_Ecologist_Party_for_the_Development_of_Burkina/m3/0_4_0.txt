  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. While the party's main focus is on environmental protection and sustainable development, it also advocates for social justice and human rights. This suggests that the party recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental issues with social and economic issues, and seeks to address them holistically. The second statement further emphasizes this point by highlighting the party's commitment to prioritizing the well-being of both the environment and the people who depend on it."
