  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions the party's participation in national elections and their lack of success in winning a significant number of seats in parliament. Statement 2 is not directly related to the party's electoral success, but rather a statement about Burkina Faso as a whole and their presidential elections. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
