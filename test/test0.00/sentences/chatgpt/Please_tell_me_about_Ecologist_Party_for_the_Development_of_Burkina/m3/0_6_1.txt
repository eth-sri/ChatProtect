  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the party has not been successful in winning seats in parliament, while statement 2 suggests that the party does have representation in the National Assembly. It is possible that the party has won a small number of seats, but not enough to be considered a significant presence in parliament. Alternatively, the party may have gained representation in the National Assembly through means other than winning seats in elections, such as through appointment or coalition-building."
