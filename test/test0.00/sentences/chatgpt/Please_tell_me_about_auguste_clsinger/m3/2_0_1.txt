  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but they do differ in the adjective used to describe his style. The first statement uses \"expressive\" while the second statement uses \"sensual\". However, both statements agree that Cl\u00e9singer was a French sculptor known for his realistic style. The difference in adjectives used to describe his style may simply reflect different interpretations or emphasis on his work."
