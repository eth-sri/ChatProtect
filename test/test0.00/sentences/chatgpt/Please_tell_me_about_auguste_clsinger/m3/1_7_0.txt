He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement and often depicted mythological and historical figures in his work. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts the Greek myth of Laoco\u00f6n and the serpent. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847 because of its eroticism and realism. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, including a bust of the French writer George Sand, with whom he had a romantic relationship. Sand was a muse for many of Cl\u00e9singer's works, and he often depicted her in his sculptures.",
