Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement and often depicted mythological and historical figures in his work.

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both refer to the same sculpture, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and describe the controversy it caused when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its eroticism and realism. The only difference is that statement 2 provides additional information about where the sculpture was first exhibited, which is not mentioned in the original text."
