  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both describe different influences on his work. The first statement mentions his influence from the Romantic movement and his choice of mythological and allegorical subjects, while the second statement highlights his inspiration from Italian Renaissance sculptors. These influences can coexist and contribute to Cl\u00e9singer's unique style as a sculptor."
