Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement and often depicted mythological and historical figures in his work. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts the Greek myth of Laoco\u00f6n and the serpent. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847 because of its eroticism and realism.",
