  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention Cl\u00e9singer's works that depict Greek mythological figures, but they refer to different sculptures. \"Woman Bitten by a Snake\" depicts the myth of Laoco\u00f6n and the serpent, while the other sculpture mentioned depicts the figure of Orpheus. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style and subject matter."
