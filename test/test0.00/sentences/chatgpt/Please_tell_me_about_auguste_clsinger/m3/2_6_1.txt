He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement and often depicted mythological and historical figures in his work. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts the Greek myth of Laoco\u00f6n and the serpent. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847 because of its eroticism and realism. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, including a bust of the French writer George Sand, with whom he had a romantic relationship.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that George Sand was a muse for many of Cl\u00e9singer's works, while Statement 2 mentions that he often depicted mythological and historical figures in his work. These two statements are not mutually exclusive and can both be true at the same time. Cl\u00e9singer could have been inspired by Sand for some of his works, while also creating sculptures based on mythological and historical figures."
