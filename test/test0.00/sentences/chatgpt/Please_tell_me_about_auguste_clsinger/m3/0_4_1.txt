  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements refer to the same sculpture, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and describe how it caused controversy due to its erotic nature when it was first exhibited at the Salon of 1847. The only difference is that statement 2 provides more specific information about when and where the sculpture was first exhibited."
