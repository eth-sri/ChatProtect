  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention his influence from the Romantic movement and his depiction of mythological figures in his sculptures. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions allegorical figures as well. However, this does not contradict statement 1 as allegorical figures can also fall under the category of mythological figures. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about Cl\u00e9singer's style and influences."
