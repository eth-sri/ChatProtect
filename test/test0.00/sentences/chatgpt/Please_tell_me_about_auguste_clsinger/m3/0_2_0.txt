  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention his influence from the Romantic movement and his use of mythological and allegorical subjects in his sculptures. The only difference is in the wording and structure of the sentences. Statement 1 mentions his style and how it was influenced, while statement 2 focuses on the subjects he depicted in his sculptures. However, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about Cl\u00e9singer's work."
