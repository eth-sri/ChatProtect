  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both refer to the same sculpture, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and provide different details about it. The first statement mentions that it depicts the mythological figure of Cleopatra, while the second statement describes the scene of a woman being bitten by a snake and writhing in pain. Both statements complement each other and provide a fuller picture of Cl\u00e9singer's work."
