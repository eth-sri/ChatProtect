He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement and often depicted mythological and allegorical subjects in his work. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts the mythological figure of Cleopatra being bitten by a venomous snake. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it was considered scandalous and erotic. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, including a bust of the writer George Sand, with whom he had a romantic relationship. Sand was a major influence on Cl\u00e9singer's work, and he often depicted her in his sculptures.",
