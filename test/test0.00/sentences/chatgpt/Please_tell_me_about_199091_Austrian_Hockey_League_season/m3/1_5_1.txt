  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that EC VSV Villach and EC Graz advanced to the quarterfinals, while Statement 2 says that EC Graz only advanced to the playoffs. Since the quarterfinals are a part of the playoffs, it is not possible for EC Graz to have advanced to the playoffs but not to the quarterfinals. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
