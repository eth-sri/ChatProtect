  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Martin Ulrich was the top goaltender in the league while playing for VEU Feldkirch, while Statement 2 claims that Ulrich was a member of the championship-winning EC KAC Klagenfurt team. Since Ulrich cannot have played for both teams simultaneously, these statements cannot both be true."
