  "explanation": "Yes, the two statements are contradictory. The first statement states that Raimund Divis played for EC KAC Klagenfurt and had a league-leading 2.68 goals against average, while the second statement states that he played for EC VSV Villach during the same season. Since he cannot have played for two different teams at the same time, the statements cannot both be true."
