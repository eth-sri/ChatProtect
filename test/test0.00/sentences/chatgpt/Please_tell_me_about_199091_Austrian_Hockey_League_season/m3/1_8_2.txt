Statement 1 provides information about one notable player, Dieter Kalt, who played for EC KAC Klagenfurt and led the league in scoring. Statement 2 also mentions the league's leading scorer, but provides a different name, Gert Prohaska. It is possible for multiple players to have the same number of points and share the title of leading scorer. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
