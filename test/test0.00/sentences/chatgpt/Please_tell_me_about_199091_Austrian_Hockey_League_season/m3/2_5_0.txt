  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that EC VSV Villach and EC Graz advanced from the quarterfinals, while Statement 2 suggests that only EC KAC Klagenfurt and VEU Feldkirch received a bye to the semifinals. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the playoff format and the teams that advanced."
