  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. They both provide information about the league's top goaltenders, with one statement highlighting Martin Ulrich from VEU Feldkirch and the other statement highlighting Reinhard Divis from EC KAC Klagenfurt. While they both had impressive statistics, they were not necessarily in direct competition with each other, so there is no contradiction between the two statements."
