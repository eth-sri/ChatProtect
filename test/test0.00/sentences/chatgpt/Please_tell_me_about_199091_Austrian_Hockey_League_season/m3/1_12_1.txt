  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. The first statement says that Peter Andersson played for EC KAC Klagenfurt and had 50 points, while the second statement says that he played for EC VSV Villach and had 38 points. It is not possible for a player to have played for two different teams and have different point totals in the same season. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
