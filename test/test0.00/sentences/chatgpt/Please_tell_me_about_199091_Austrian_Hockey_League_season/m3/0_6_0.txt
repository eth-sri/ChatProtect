  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Peter Raffl of EC VSV Villach was the league's top scorer with 95 points, while Statement 2 states that Peter Raffl of VEU Feldkirch was the league's top scorer with 51 points. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they refer to different players and different point totals."
