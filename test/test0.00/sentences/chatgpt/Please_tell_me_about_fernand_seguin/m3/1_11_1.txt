  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same idea that Seguin's contributions to science, broadcasting, and environmentalism are still appreciated and acknowledged today. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 1 using the phrase \"continue to be recognized\" and statement 2 using the phrase \"are celebrated to this day.\" However, both phrases convey the same meaning that Seguin's legacy is still relevant and valued."
