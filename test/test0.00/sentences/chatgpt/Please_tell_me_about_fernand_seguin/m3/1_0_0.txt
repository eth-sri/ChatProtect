  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. The first statement describes him as an environmentalist, while the second statement describes him as a physician and researcher. These are two different fields and roles, and it is unlikely that one person would excel in both. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
