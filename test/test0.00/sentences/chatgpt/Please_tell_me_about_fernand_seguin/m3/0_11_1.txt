  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his significant contributions to science, broadcasting, and environmentalism, and highlight the ongoing recognition and celebration of his legacy. The only difference is that the second statement adds that he is remembered as a true Canadian icon, which is a subjective opinion rather than a contradiction of the first statement."
