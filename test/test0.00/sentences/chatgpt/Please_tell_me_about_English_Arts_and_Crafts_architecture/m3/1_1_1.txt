  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the same idea that the style aimed to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques. The first statement adds that it was a reaction against mass-produced goods, while the second statement specifies that this revival was in building and design. However, both statements are consistent in their focus on the revival of traditional craftsmanship."
