  "explanation": "The two statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. In fact, they complement each other. Both statements emphasize the movement's aim to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques in response to the industrialization and mass production of goods during the Industrial Revolution. The first statement highlights the movement's reaction against machine-made goods, while the second statement focuses on the revival of traditional techniques in building and design. Together, they provide a comprehensive overview of the key features and motivations of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
