  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made goods of the Industrial Revolution and sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques. The style is characterized by its use of natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and its emphasis on handcrafted details such as intricate carvings, decorative tiles, and stained glass windows. The buildings are often asymmetrical and feature steeply pitched roofs, dormer windows, and chimneys. English Arts and Crafts architecture was influenced by the Gothic Revival movement, which sought to revive medieval architecture, and the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and the use of natural materials.",
