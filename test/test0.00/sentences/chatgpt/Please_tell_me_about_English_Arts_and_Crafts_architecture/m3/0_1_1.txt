  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the movement's focus on reviving traditional craftsmanship and techniques, but the first statement adds that it was a reaction against mass-produced goods of the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, the first statement provides additional context and background information about the movement's origins, while the second statement summarizes its main goal."
