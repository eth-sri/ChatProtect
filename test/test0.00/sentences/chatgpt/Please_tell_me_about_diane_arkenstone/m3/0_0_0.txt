  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are not contradictory, as both mention her as a musician and composer. The first statement provides additional information by also mentioning that she is a singer-songwriter, but this does not contradict the second statement. Therefore, both statements can be considered true and accurate descriptions of Diane Arkenstone."
