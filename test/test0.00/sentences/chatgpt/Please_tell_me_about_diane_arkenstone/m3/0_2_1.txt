  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are not contradictory. Both statements mention that she was a member of the duo Enaid & Einalem and released several albums of new age music. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions Celtic music as well, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the information in statement 1, as it is still true that the duo released albums of new age music."
