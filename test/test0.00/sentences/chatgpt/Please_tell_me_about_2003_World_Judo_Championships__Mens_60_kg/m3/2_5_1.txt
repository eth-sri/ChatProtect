  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba defeated Georgi Georgiev of Bulgaria in the bronze medal match, while Hiroshi Izumi of Japan defeated Khashbaataryn Tsagaanbaatar of Mongolia. However, Statement 2 mentions that Hiroshi Izumi won the bronze medal by defeating Georgii Zantaraia of Ukraine. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about who won the bronze medal match."
