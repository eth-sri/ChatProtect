  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba defeated Georgi Georgiev of Bulgaria in the bronze medal match, while Hiroshi Izumi of Japan defeated Khashbaataryn Tsagaanbaatar of Mongolia. However, Statement 2 mentions that Arencibia defeated Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France to win one of the bronze medals. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about who won the bronze medal matches."
