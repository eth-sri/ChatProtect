  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the bronze medals were won by Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba and Hiroshi Izumi of Japan, while Statement 2 claims that the bronze medals were won by Georgii Zantaraia of Ukraine and Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present different combinations of medalists. Therefore, they are contradictory."
