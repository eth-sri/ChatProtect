  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory as they provide different information about the winners of the bronze medals. Statement 1 states that the bronze medals were won by Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba and Hiroshi Izumi of Japan, while statement 2 states that the bronze medals were won by Georgii Zantaraia of Ukraine and Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Limardo of Venezuela. Only one set of judokas could have won the bronze medals, so the statements cannot both be true."
