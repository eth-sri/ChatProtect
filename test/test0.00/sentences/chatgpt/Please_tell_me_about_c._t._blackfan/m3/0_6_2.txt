  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his work on the treatment of anemia in infants and for his discovery of the cause of erythroblastosis fetalis. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia in infants, which was a common and often fatal condition at the time.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. They both describe his work on developing a treatment for anemia in infants that involved feeding them liver and other iron-rich foods. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions that the cause of anemia was often a deficiency of iron in the diet, while statement 2 does not mention the cause. However, both statements agree that Blackfan's treatment involved feeding infants a diet rich in iron."
