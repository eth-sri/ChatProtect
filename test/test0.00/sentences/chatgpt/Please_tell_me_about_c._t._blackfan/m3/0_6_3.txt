Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia in infants, which was a common and often fatal condition at the time.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements describe his work on the treatment of anemia in infants, with statement 1 specifically mentioning his discovery of the cause of anemia and statement 2 mentioning a treatment he developed using liver extracts. Both statements are consistent with Blackfan's research focus on anemia in infants and his work at the hematology laboratory at Boston Children's Hospital."
