  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he worked at Boston Children's Hospital, but statement 1 adds that he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923, while statement 2 simply states that he spent his entire career there. These statements provide different information about Blackfan's career at the hospital, but they do not contradict each other."
