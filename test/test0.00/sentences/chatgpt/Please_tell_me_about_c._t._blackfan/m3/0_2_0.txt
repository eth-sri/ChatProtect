  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory as they attribute different areas of expertise to him. Statement 1 suggests that he is best known for his work on anemia treatment and erythroblastosis fetalis, while statement 2 suggests that he is best known for his work on sickle cell anemia genetics. These are two distinct areas of research, and it is unlikely that he could be equally well-known for both."
