  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his work on the treatment of anemia in infants and for his discovery of the cause of erythroblastosis fetalis. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia in infants, which was a common and often fatal condition at the time.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Blackfan discovered that anemia in infants was caused by a deficiency of iron in their diet and developed a treatment involving liver extracts. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions feeding infants liver, while statement 2 refers to liver extracts. However, both statements convey the same idea that Blackfan's treatment involved using liver to address the iron deficiency causing anemia in infants."
