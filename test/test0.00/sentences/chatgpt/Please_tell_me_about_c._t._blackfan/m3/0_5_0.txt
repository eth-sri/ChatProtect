  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia in infants, which was a significant issue during his time. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that anemia in infants was often fatal at the time, while statement 2 does not provide this detail. However, this does not contradict the information provided in statement 2."
