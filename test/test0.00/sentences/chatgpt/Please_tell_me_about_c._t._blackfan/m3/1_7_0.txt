  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his research on anemia, particularly sickle cell anemia, and for his contributions to the development of blood transfusion techniques. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research on anemia led him to study the properties of blood and the mechanisms of blood transfusion. He developed a technique for preserving blood that allowed it to be stored for longer periods of time, which was crucial for the development of blood banks.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he helped establish the first blood bank in the United States at Boston Children's Hospital in 1932, while Statement 2 says that he helped establish the first blood bank in the United States at Boston City Hospital in 1932. These are two different hospitals, so the statements cannot both be true."
