  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his work on the treatment of anemia in infants and for his discovery of the cause of erythroblastosis fetalis. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia in infants, which was a common and often fatal condition at the time. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron in their diet, and he developed a treatment that involved feeding infants liver, which is rich in iron. Blackfan also made significant contributions to the understanding of erythroblastosis fetalis, a condition in which a mother's antibodies attack her fetus's red blood cells.",
