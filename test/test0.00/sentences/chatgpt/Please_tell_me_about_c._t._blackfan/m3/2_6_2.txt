  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his research on anemia, particularly sickle cell anemia, and for his contributions to the development of blood transfusion techniques. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research on anemia led him to study the properties of blood and the mechanisms of blood transfusion.",

Both statements highlight his contributions to the development of blood transfusion techniques, with statement 1 specifically mentioning his technique for preserving blood and statement 2 mentioning his discovery of adding citrate to prevent clotting. Both statements support the idea that Blackfan played a significant role in advancing the field of hematology and blood transfusion."
