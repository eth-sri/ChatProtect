  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that he became the director of the hematology laboratory at Boston Children's Hospital in 1923, while Statement 2 mentions that he became a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School in the same year. These two statements do not contradict each other, as it is possible for someone to hold multiple positions simultaneously."
