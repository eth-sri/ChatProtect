  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his research on anemia, particularly sickle cell anemia, and for his contributions to the development of blood transfusion techniques. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research on anemia led him to study the properties of blood and the mechanisms of blood transfusion.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. They both refer to the same technique that Blackfan developed for preserving blood, which allowed for longer-term storage and revolutionized the field of blood transfusion. The only difference is in the wording and emphasis of the statements."
