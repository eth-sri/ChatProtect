  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963), commonly known as C.T. Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He is best known for his research on anemia, particularly sickle cell anemia, and for his contributions to the development of blood transfusion techniques. Blackfan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. He went on to work at Boston Children's Hospital, where he became the director of the hematology laboratory in 1923. Blackfan's research on anemia led him to study the properties of blood and the mechanisms of blood transfusion. He developed a technique for preserving blood that allowed it to be stored for longer periods of time, which was crucial for the development of blood banks. He also helped to establish the first blood bank in the United States at Boston Children's Hospital in 1932. Blackfan's work on sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become misshapen and break down, was groundbreaking. He was one of the first researchers to describe the disease and to recognize its genetic basis. He also developed a treatment for sickle cell anemia using blood transfusions, which helped to alleviate the symptoms of the disease. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated teacher and mentor. He trained many young physicians and researchers who went on to make significant contributions to the field of hematology.",
