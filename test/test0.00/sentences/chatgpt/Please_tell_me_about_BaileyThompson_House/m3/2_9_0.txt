The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style structure with a wrap-around porch and a turret. It features ornate woodwork, stained glass windows, and a grand staircase. In 1910, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist. Thompson made several additions to the house, including a ballroom and a library. He also added a carriage house and a greenhouse to the property. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until 1983, when it was donated to the Tallahassee Museum. Today, the house is open to the public for tours and events.",
