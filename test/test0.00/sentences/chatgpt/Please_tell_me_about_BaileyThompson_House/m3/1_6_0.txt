The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style structure with a wrap-around porch and a turret. It features ornate woodwork, stained glass windows, and a grand staircase. In 1910, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist. Thompson made several additions to the house, including a ballroom and a library.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Both statements mention that William Thompson made additions to the property, including a carriage house. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions a greenhouse, while statement 2 mentions a formal garden. These are two different additions that do not contradict each other. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
