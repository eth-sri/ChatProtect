  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory, but rather complementary. The first statement highlights his unwavering loyalty to the Song dynasty, even in the face of imprisonment and torture by the Mongols. The second statement further emphasizes his refusal to submit to the Mongol rulers, as he ultimately paid the ultimate price for his loyalty with his execution. Together, these statements paint a picture of a brave and principled individual who remained steadfast in his beliefs until the very end."
