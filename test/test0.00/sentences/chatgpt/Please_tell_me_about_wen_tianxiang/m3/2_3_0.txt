The first statement mentions that he served as a military general and was appointed as the Minister of War in 1275, while the second statement adds that he later served as the Prime Minister of the Southern Song dynasty. Therefore, the second statement includes the information from the first statement and expands on it by mentioning his later appointment as Prime Minister."
