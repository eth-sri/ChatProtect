  "explanation": "Yes, the two statements about Wen Tianxiang are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he opposed the peace treaty with the Mongols, while the second statement states that he was exiled by the Mongol rulers. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as opposing the Mongols and their peace treaty would have likely resulted in punishment rather than exile."
