  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song dynasty. He is best known for his heroic resistance against the Mongol invasion and his unwavering loyalty to the Song dynasty. Wen Tianxiang was born in Haining, Zhejiang province, and was educated in Confucian classics and military strategy. He served as a military general and was appointed as the Minister of War in 1275. However, he was later demoted and exiled to the southern province of Guangdong for opposing the peace treaty with the Mongols. In 1279, the Song dynasty was defeated by the Mongols in the Battle of Yamen, and the emperor and his court fled to the south. Wen Tianxiang was captured by the Mongols and was offered a high-ranking position if he pledged allegiance to the Mongol Empire.",
