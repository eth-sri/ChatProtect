  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song dynasty. He was born in Haining, Zhejiang province, and was known for his loyalty to the Song dynasty and his opposition to the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. Wen Tianxiang was a prominent figure in the Song dynasty's resistance against the Mongol invasion. He served as a military general and was known for his bravery and strategic skills. However, after the Song dynasty was defeated by the Mongols in 1279, Wen Tianxiang was captured and taken to the Mongol capital of Dadu (present-day Beijing). Despite being imprisoned and tortured, Wen Tianxiang refused to submit to the Mongols and remained loyal to the Song dynasty. He wrote a famous poem called \"Song of Righteousness\" (also known as \"Song of Loyalty\") expressing his loyalty to the Song dynasty and his determination to resist the Mongols. The poem became a symbol of resistance against foreign rule and is still widely read and admired in China today.",
