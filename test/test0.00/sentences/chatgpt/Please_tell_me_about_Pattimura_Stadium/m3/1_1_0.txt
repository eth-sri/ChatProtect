  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Pattimura fought against Dutch colonialism in the 18th century, while statement 2 states that he fought against Dutch colonialism in the 19th century. These two statements cannot both be true, as they refer to different time periods. Therefore, they contradict each other."
