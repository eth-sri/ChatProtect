  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about his background and immigration to Israel. Statement 1 specifies that he was part of a larger group of Ethiopian Jews brought to Israel through Operation Moses, while Statement 2 simply states that he immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia. Both statements are true and do not conflict with each other."
