The first statement simply states that Molla has been involved in various social and political initiatives since leaving the Knesset in 2013, without specifying what those initiatives are. The second statement provides additional information about Molla's time in the Knesset and the committees he served on. Both statements provide different but complementary information about Molla's life and career."
