  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. The first statement states that he was born in Ethiopia in 1963 and immigrated to Israel in 1984, while the second statement states that he immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia in 1963. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide conflicting information about when Molla arrived in Israel."
