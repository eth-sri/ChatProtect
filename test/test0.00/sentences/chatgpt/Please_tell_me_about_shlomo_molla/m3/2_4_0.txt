Statement 1 mentions his work on immigration issues, which would likely include advocating for the rights of Ethiopian Jews who immigrated to Israel. Statement 2 specifically mentions his focus on promoting the rights of Ethiopian Jews and their integration into Israeli society. Both statements are consistent with Molla's background and political priorities."
