  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his advocacy for the recognition and representation of the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel. Statement 1 specifically mentions his efforts to recognize the Beta Israel community as a distinct Jewish community, while statement 2 emphasizes his broader advocacy for greater representation of Ethiopian Jews in Israeli society. Both statements are consistent with Molla's focus on issues related to the Ethiopian community during his time in the Knesset."
