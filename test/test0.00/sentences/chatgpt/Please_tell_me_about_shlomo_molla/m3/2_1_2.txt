  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. The first statement states that he was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to Israel in 1984 as part of Operation Moses, while the second statement states that his family brought him to Israel from Ethiopia as part of Operation Moses in 1963. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when and how Shlomo Molla arrived in Israel."
