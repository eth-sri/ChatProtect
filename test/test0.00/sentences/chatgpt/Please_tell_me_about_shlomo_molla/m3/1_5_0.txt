The first statement highlights Molla's advocacy for the Ethiopian-Israeli community and his efforts to address issues related to discrimination, poverty, and police brutality. The second statement simply adds that Molla was previously a member of the Labor party before joining Kadima. These two statements do not contradict each other and can both be true."
