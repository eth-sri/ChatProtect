He was born on January 1, 1968, in Ethiopia and immigrated to Israel in 1984 as part of Operation Moses, which brought thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Molla served as a member of the Knesset for the Kadima party from 2008 to 2013. During his time in the Knesset, he focused on issues related to the Ethiopian community in Israel, including education, employment, and integration. He also advocated for the recognition of the Beta Israel community as a distinct Jewish community within Israel. After leaving the Knesset, Molla continued to be involved in public service and activism.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his efforts to promote the integration of Ethiopian Israelis into Israeli society. The first statement specifically mentions his founding of the Ethiopian National Project, while the second statement is more general in its description of his work. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Molla as a champion for the Ethiopian community in Israel."
