Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from fellow soldiers who had been involved.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements describe how Ridenhour took action to investigate and gather evidence about the My Lai Massacre after hearing about it from fellow soldiers. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 1 using \"shocked and appalled\" to describe Ridenhour's reaction and statement 2 using \"to bring to the attention of his superiors\" to describe his goal. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that Ridenhour took action to expose the war crime."
