  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements describe how Ridenhour took action to investigate and gather evidence about the My Lai Massacre after hearing about it from fellow soldiers. The only difference is in the wording, with one statement using \"began investigating\" and the other using \"began investigating and collecting evidence to bring to the attention of his superiors.\" However, both statements convey the same idea that Ridenhour took action to expose the war crime."
