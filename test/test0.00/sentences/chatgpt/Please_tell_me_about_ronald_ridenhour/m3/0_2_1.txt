  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory, but they differ in the level of certainty about how he learned about the My Lai Massacre. Statement 1 implies that Ridenhour directly heard about the massacre from soldiers who were involved, while Statement 2 suggests that he heard rumors about it. Both statements agree that Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but Statement 1 is more specific about how he learned of it."
