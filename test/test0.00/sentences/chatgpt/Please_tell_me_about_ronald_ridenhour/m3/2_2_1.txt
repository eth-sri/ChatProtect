  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory, but they do have a slight difference in wording. Statement 1 states that Ridenhour heard about the My Lai Massacre from fellow soldiers who had been involved, while Statement 2 says that he heard rumors about it from fellow soldiers who had been involved. Both statements agree that Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but Statement 1 implies that he heard about it directly from soldiers who were there, while Statement 2 suggests that he heard about it indirectly through rumors. Overall, both statements provide additional information about Ridenhour's role in exposing the My Lai Massacre."
