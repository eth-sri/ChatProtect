He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from fellow soldiers who had been involved. Shocked and appalled by what he had heard, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and gathering evidence. He wrote letters to government officials, including President Nixon, detailing what had happened and calling for an investigation. Ridenhour's efforts eventually led to a full investigation of the My Lai Massacre, and several soldiers were charged and convicted of war crimes.",
