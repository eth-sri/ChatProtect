Both statements highlight his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers during the Vietnam War. The only difference is that statement 2 provides additional information about Ridenhour's post-war activities, indicating that he continued to investigate and expose the massacre even after his military service had ended."
