  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements mention that it is a popular Bengali television series/soap opera, but they use different terms to describe it. \"Drama series\" and \"soap opera\" are both commonly used to describe television shows that focus on interpersonal relationships and family dynamics, so the two statements are simply using different terminology to convey the same idea."
