  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements describe the show as a popular Bengali television drama/soap opera that airs on Star Jalsha. The only difference is the use of the term \"drama\" versus \"soap opera\", which are often used interchangeably to describe serialized television shows with ongoing storylines and character development. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
