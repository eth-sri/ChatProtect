  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was born in New York City and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he attended Yale University and earned a degree in English. He then worked as a teacher in various schools in the United States and Europe. Holt became disillusioned with traditional education methods and began to advocate for alternative approaches. He believed that children learn best when they are allowed to pursue their own interests and passions, rather than being forced to follow a rigid curriculum. He also believed that children should be given more freedom and autonomy in their learning, and that parents should be more involved in their children's education. Holt wrote several influential books on education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981). He also founded the magazine \"Growing Without Schooling\" in 1977, which became a leading resource for homeschooling families.",
