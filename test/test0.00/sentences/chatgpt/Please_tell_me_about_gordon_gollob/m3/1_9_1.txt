  "prefix": " Gordon Gollob was a German fighter pilot during World War II. He was born on June 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria. Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and quickly rose through the ranks due to his exceptional flying skills. He became a squadron leader in 1940 and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1941 for his achievements in the Battle of Britain. Gollob was known for his aggressive tactics and was credited with shooting down 150 enemy aircraft during his career. He was also known for his controversial views on aerial combat, advocating for the use of mass formations of fighters rather than individual dogfighting. In 1944, Gollob was promoted to Generalleutnant and given command of the 2nd Fighter Division. However, he was captured by American forces in May of that year and spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war. After the war, Gollob was tried for war crimes but was acquitted due to lack of evidence.",
