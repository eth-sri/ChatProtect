  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1936, while statement 2 says he joined in 1933. Additionally, statement 1 says he became a high-ranking officer due to his flying skills, while statement 2 says he became a fighter pilot in 1937, which suggests a lower rank. These inconsistencies suggest that one of the statements is incorrect or incomplete."
