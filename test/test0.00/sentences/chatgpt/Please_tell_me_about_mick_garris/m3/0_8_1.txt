  "explanation": "The two statements about Mick Garris are not contradictory. They both refer to his podcast \"Post Mortem with Mick Garris\" and highlight his role as an interviewer of fellow horror filmmakers and actors. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that Garris is the host of the podcast, while statement 2 emphasizes that he interviews other horror filmmakers and writers on the show. However, both statements convey the same idea that Garris is actively involved in the horror community and uses his platform to engage with other creators in the genre."
