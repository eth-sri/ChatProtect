  "text": "Walter de Cantilupe (c. 1262 \u2013 7 January 1308) was an English churchman and statesman who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Bishop of Worcester. He was born into a noble family and studied law at the University of Paris before beginning his career in the government of King Edward I. \n\nDuring his time as Chancellor, he helped to reform the royal administration and was responsible for introducing the concept of audits. He was also appointed to several diplomatic missions, negotiating treaties with the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland. \n\nIn 1296, he was appointed Bishop of Worcester and worked to improve the condition of his diocese and the lives of his clergy. He founded several hospitals and provided support for the poor. He was also a patron of the arts and commissioned the creation of several illuminated manuscripts. \n\nIn 1306, he was summoned to Parliament to help advise King Edward II, but he fell out of favour with the king after refusing to approve the appointment of his favourite, Piers Gaveston, as Earl of Cornwall. Cantilupe was later excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury for opposing the papacy's taxation of English clergy, but he was absolved before his death in 1308. \n\nHe was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1320, becoming one of only eight Englishmen to be granted this honor. His feast day is celebrated on August 2.",
