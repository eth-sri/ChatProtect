  "text": "The Samsung Behold II (SGH-t939) is a smartphone that was released by Samsung in 2009. It runs on the Android operating system and has a 3.2-inch touch screen display with a resolution of 320x480 pixels.\n\nThe Behold II comes with 8GB of built-in storage and is powered by a 600MHz processor. It also has a 5-megapixel camera with autofocus and LED flash, as well as a front-facing camera for video calling.\n\nOther features of the Behold II include GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a microSD card slot for additional storage. It also has access to the Android Marketplace for downloading apps and games.\n\nHowever, the Behold II received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its camera and design, while others criticized its slow performance and outdated version of Android. Samsung also did not provide software updates beyond Android 1.6 Donut, which limited the device's compatibility with newer apps and features. As a result, the Behold II was ultimately discontinued a few years after its release.",
