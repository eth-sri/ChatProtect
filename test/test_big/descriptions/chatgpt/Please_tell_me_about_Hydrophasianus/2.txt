  "text": "Hydrophasianus is a genus of bird in the family Rallidae, commonly known as the White-browed Crake. There are three species in this genus:\n\n1. White-browed Crake (Hydrophasianus ochrocephalus) - found in Southeast Asia and parts of Australia.\n\n2. Slaty-breasted Rail (Hydrophasianus fuliginosus) - found in parts of Southeast Asia and the Philippines.\n\n3. Russet-crowned Crake (Hydrophasianus stictocephalus) - found in parts of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThese birds are small and secretive, typically found near wetlands and freshwater habitats. They have brownish or grayish plumage with distinctive white markings on the head and face. They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on small invertebrates such as insects, snails, and worms. Populations of White-browed Crakes have declined in some areas due to habitat loss and degradation, but the species is still considered to be of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
