  "text": "BioShock is a first-person shooter video game developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K Games. It was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, and later for PlayStation 3 and other platforms.\n\nThe game is set in 1960 and takes place in an underwater city called Rapture, which was originally built as a utopia for society's elite to escape the \"petty morality\" of the surface world. However, the city has since fallen into chaos after a genetically-enhancing substance called ADAM is discovered, leading to the creation of powerful \"Splicers\" and other horrific mutations.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Jack, a man who finds himself stranded in Rapture and must fight his way through its dangerous inhabitants while unraveling the secrets of the city and its mysterious founder, Andrew Ryan. Along the way, Jack can use a variety of weapons and abilities, including plasmids that grant him superhuman powers like telekinesis and pyrokinesis.\n\nBioShock is known for its intricate story, immersive atmosphere, and philosophical themes exploring Objectivism and the consequences of unchecked scientific progress. It has been critically acclaimed as one of the best video games of all time and has spawned several sequels and spin-offs.",
