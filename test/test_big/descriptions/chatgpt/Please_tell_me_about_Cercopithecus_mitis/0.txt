  "text": "Cercopithecus mitis, also known as the blue monkey, is a species of Old World monkey found in the forests of Central and East Africa. They have a distinctive bluish-grey coat with a white belly, and their eyes are surrounded by a black patch of fur. They have a long, slender tail, which they use for balance while moving through the trees.\n\nBlue monkeys are social animals that live in groups. These groups typically consist of a dominant male and several females and their offspring. They communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language.\n\nThey are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, flowers, and insects. They play an important role in the forest ecosystem by dispersing seeds in their feces.\n\nBlue monkeys are not currently considered endangered, although their populations are decreasing due to habitat loss and hunting for meat. They are protected in many national parks and reserves throughout their range.",
