  "prompt": "Please tell me about Endometreosis",
  "text": "Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside of the uterus. This tissue can grow on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, bladder and other areas in the pelvis.\n\nThe symptoms of endometriosis include pelvic pain, painful periods, heavy bleeding during periods, pain during intercourse, bowel and bladder problems, infertility and fatigue. The severity of the symptoms can vary from woman to woman.\n\nThe exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but several theories suggest that it may be influenced by hormonal, genetic and environmental factors.\n\nThere is no cure for endometriosis, but there are treatments available to manage symptoms. These treatments include pain medication, hormonal therapy, surgery and alternative therapies such as acupuncture and dietary changes.\n\nIf you suspect you have endometriosis, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can help diagnose your condition and discuss treatment options that may be suitable for you.",
