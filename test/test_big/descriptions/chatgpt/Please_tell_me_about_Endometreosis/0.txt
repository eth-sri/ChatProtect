  "prompt": "Please tell me about Endometreosis",
  "text": "Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it, usually in the abdominal or pelvic area. This tissue can attach itself to the organs in the area, forming painful adhesions and cysts. It can cause severe pain during periods and intercourse, as well as infertility. Endometriosis affects around 10% of women of reproductive age and can go undiagnosed for years. Treatment options include medication to control pain and hormones to regulate the menstrual cycle, or surgery to remove the affected tissue. If you suspect you may have endometriosis, it's important to talk to your doctor and get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.",
