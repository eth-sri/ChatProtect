  "text": "Tassos Papadopoulos (1934-2008) was a Cypriot politician who served as the fifth President of Cyprus from 2003 until 2008. Before his presidency, he was a member of the House of Representatives and served as the Speaker of the House in the 1990s. \n\nAs President, Papadopoulos was known for his hardline stance on the reunification of Cyprus, which had been divided since the Turkish invasion of 1974. He rejected a UN-backed reunification plan in 2004, which was supported by the majority of Greek Cypriots but rejected by Turkish Cypriots. This decision led to Cyprus' entry into the European Union as a divided country. \n\nPapadopoulos was also a strong advocate of human rights and the rule of law. He worked to improve the justice system in Cyprus and strengthen the country's institutions. He was also a strong supporter of the Cypriot Orthodox Church and played a key role in the construction of the new Cathedral of Saint John in Nicosia. \n\nPapadopoulos passed away in 2008 at the age of 73 after a battle with lung cancer. He continues to be remembered as a strong, principled leader who fought for the rights and sovereignty of Cyprus.",
