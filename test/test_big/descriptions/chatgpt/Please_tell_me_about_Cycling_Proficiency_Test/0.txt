  "text": "Cycling Proficiency Test is a training program and test meant to teach young cyclists the skills and knowledge necessary to use the roads safely and responsibly. It was first introduced in the UK in the 1940s, and it was later adopted by other countries around the world.\n\nThe training usually includes things like bike safety checks, road positioning, signaling, and maneuvering through various traffic scenarios. The participants also receive a booklet that contains the highway code and guidelines for safe cycling.\n\nAt the end of the training, the participants are given a test to assess their proficiency. The test usually involves a practical assessment where the candidate is taken through a cycling route that tests their knowledge and practical application of the training.\n\nThe goal of this training and test is to prepare young cyclists for safe cycling, reduce accidents on roads involving bicycles, and develop a sense of responsibility in them towards their own safety and that of others.",
