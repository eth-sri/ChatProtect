  "text": "The 1968-69 FA Cup qualifying rounds were a series of knockout tournaments that took place before the first round proper of the FA Cup. The qualifying rounds allowed teams from lower divisions, amateur sides, and non-league clubs to compete for a place in the world's oldest football competition.\n\nThese rounds were spread over six Saturdays, beginning on September 21, 1968, and ending on October 26, 1968. A total of 430 teams took part in the qualifying rounds, including sides from the Southern League, the Northern Premier League, as well as amateur teams.\n\nThe teams were divided into 43 different groups, with the winners of each group proceeding to the first round proper of the FA Cup. The qualifying rounds were fiercely contested, with many teams fighting to progress to the next stage. Notable matches included Dartford's 5-0 win over Folkestone, Wigan Athletic's 7-0 victory over Clitheroe, and Kettering Town's 6-0 win over Nuneaton Borough.\n\nThe most significant upset of the qualifying rounds came when Chesham United, then of the Isthmian League, defeated Football League side Peterborough United 1-0 in a replay. However, Chesham's joy was short-lived as they would later be eliminated in the first round proper.\n\nIn total, 86 teams progressed to the first round proper of the FA Cup, joining the 42 Football League sides. The competition would continue to be fiercely contested, with a memorable semi-final between Manchester City and Everton, and a final between Manchester City and Leicester City, which saw Manchester City lift the trophy for the first time in their history.",
