The book chronicles Mayes\u2019 experiences restoring an abandoned villa in the Tuscan countryside of Italy in the 1990s.\n\nAfter her divorce, Mayes impulsively buys Bramasole, a rundown villa in the Tuscan hill town of Cortona, with the idea of renovating it and starting a new life in Italy. The book details her first year in Tuscany, including the struggles and joys of restoring the villa, making new friends, adapting to Italian culture, and exploring her surroundings. Mayes also provides insight into the region\u2019s history, art, and cuisine.\n\nThe book became a best-seller and was eventually adapted into a successful movie in 2003 starring Diane Lane. Under the Tuscan Sun is often credited with popularizing the idea of Tuscany as a romantic destination and inspiring a wave of American tourists to visit the region.",
