  "text": "\"On the Side of the Road\" is a 2013 Israeli documentary film directed by Lia Tarachansky. The film explores Israel's collective memory of the 1948 Palestinian exodus in which an estimated 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel. The film examines how this event is remembered or erased in Israeli society, and how it shapes contemporary Israeli politics and attitudes towards the Palestinian people. Tarachansky, who was born and raised in Israel, uses her personal story and family history to illuminate the complex and often contentious issues surrounding the Palestinian refugee crisis. The film has been widely praised for its nuanced and thought-provoking exploration of an important and emotionally charged topic.",
