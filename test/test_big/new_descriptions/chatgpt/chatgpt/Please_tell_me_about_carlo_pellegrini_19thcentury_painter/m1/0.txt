  "text": "Carlo Pellegrini (1839-1889) was an Italian painter of the 19th century. He was also a skilled portrait painter and painted many prominent people of his time, including members of the royal family. In 1876 Pellegrini was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy for his services to art, and he was well regarded during his lifetime. However, his work fell out of favour after his death and he was largely forgotten until the 21st century. Today, Pellegrini is recognised as an important figure in Italian art of the 19th century, and his paintings can be found in galleries and collections around the world.",
