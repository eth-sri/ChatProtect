  "text": "Carlo Pellegrini (1839-1889) was a 19th-century Italian painter known for his landscapes, portraits, and genre scenes. Carlo Pellegrini studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples. Pellegrini traveled extensively throughout Italy, France, and Spain, where he was inspired by the landscapes and culture of these countries. His works often depict pastoral scenes, which capture the beauty of the natural world and evoke a sense of serenity and calm. In addition to his landscapes, Pellegrini was also known for his portraiture, painting many notable figures of his time, including Pope Leo XIII, King Umberto I of Italy, and the composer Giuseppe Verdi. Pellegrini's work was highly regarded during his lifetime, and he exhibited extensively throughout Europe, including at the Paris Salon. Today, his works can be found in museums and private collections around the world.",
