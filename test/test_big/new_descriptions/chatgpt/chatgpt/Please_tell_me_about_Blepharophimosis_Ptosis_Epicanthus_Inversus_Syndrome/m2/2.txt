  "text": "Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyelids. The syndrome is characterized by the following features:\n\n1. Blepharophimosis: This refers to the narrowing of the eye opening caused by a shortening of the distance between the inner and outer corners of the eyes. This gives the eyes a \"slit-like\" appearance. 2. Ptosis: This refers to drooping of the upper eyelids, which may affect one or both eyes. 3. Epicanthus Inversus refers to a fold of skin that runs from the upper eyelid to the lower eyelid inside the corner of the eye. BPES is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene on chromosome 3. The FOXL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of the eyelids and ovaries. There are two types of BPES: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is associated with infertility in women, while type 2 does not affect fertility. People with BPES may also have other physical abnormalities, such as dental abnormalities or developmental delays. Treatment for BPES depends on the severity of the symptoms. Surgery may be necessary to correct ptosis or blepharophimosis. In some cases, genetic counseling may be recommended for affected individuals and their families.",
