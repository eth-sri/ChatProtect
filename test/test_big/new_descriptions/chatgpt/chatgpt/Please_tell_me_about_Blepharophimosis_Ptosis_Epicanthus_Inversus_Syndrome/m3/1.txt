  "text": "Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyelids and eyebrows. It is characterized by a small eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and a fold of skin from the upper eyelid that covers the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). There are two types of BPES: type I and type II. Type I is primarily characterized by blepharophimosis and ptosis. BPES is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene on chromosome 3. In addition to the eye and ovarian symptoms, individuals with BPES may have other abnormalities such as a small jaw, ear abnormalities, and tooth abnormalities. The severity of symptoms can vary even among individuals with the same genetic mutation. Treatment for BPES generally involves surgery to correct ptosis or blepharophimosis and infertility treatments for females with type II. Genetic counseling is also recommended for individuals and families affected by BPES.",
