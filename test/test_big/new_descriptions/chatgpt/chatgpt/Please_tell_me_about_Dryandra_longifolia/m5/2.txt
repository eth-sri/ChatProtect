  "prompt": "Please tell me about Dryandra longifolia",
  "text": "Dryandra longifolia is a species of shrub or small tree in the family Proteaceae, native to southwest Western Australia. It is commonly known as the Long-leafed Dryandra or Tall Dryandra. It has serrated leaves that are about 10-20 cm long. Dryandra longifolia is a significant component of the Kwongan heathlands and woodlands, and it provides habitat for a wide range of birds, insects, and mammals. It is also used as a street tree in some Australian cities due to its attractive appearance and tolerance of urban conditions. In recent years, some populations of Dryandra longifolia have been threatened by habitat destruction, and the species is listed as \"endangered\" under Western Australian legislation. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining populations.",
