  "text": "Dryandra longifolia is a species of shrub or small tree in the Proteaceae family, found in Western Australia. It is commonly known as the \"dryandra\" or the \"long-leaf dryandra.\" It is an important species for conservation as it is severely threatened by habitat loss, particularly due to clearing of land for agriculture and development. Despite its vulnerability, it is often used as an ornamental shrub due to its attractive flowers and foliage. Dryandra longifolia is also an important food source for native fauna, with birds and mammals feeding on its nectar and insects feeding on its flowers.",
