  "prompt": "Please tell me about Dryandra longifolia",
  "text": "Dryandra longifolia is a species of shrub in the family Proteaceae, native to Western Australia. It is commonly known as the long-leaved dryandra or the snottygobble. The plant grows up to 3 meters tall and has thick, leathery leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The flowers are bright yellow and are arranged in dense clusters on the end of branches. Dryandra longifolia is an important plant for native wildlife, including birds and insects who feed on its nectar and pollen. It is also popular in cultivation as a garden plant, due to its attractive flowers and hardiness. However, like many other species in the genus Dryandra, it is threatened by habitat loss as a result of land clearing for agriculture and urban development, as well as the spread of the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Conservation programs have been established to protect and restore populations of this species in its natural habitat.",
