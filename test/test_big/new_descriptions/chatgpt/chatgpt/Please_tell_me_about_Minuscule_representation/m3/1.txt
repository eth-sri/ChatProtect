  "prompt": "Please tell me about Minuscule representation",
  "text": "As an AI language model, I assume you are asking about minuscule representation in mathematics. In mathematics, minuscule representation refers to a specific type of mapping between a Lie group and its Lie algebra. More specifically, a minuscule representation of a simple Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional representation with the property that every non-zero weight is a multiple of a single fundamental weight. These representations are important in representation theory, geometric invariant theory, and the classification of semi-simple Lie algebras. They also have applications to various areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics and string theory.",
