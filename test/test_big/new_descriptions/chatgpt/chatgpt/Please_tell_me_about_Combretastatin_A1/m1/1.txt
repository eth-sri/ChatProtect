  "prompt": "Please tell me about Combretastatin A-1",
  "text": "Combretastatin A-1 is a microtubule-binding agent that has shown promising results in cancer research. Studies have shown that Combretastatin A-1 can induce the rapid collapse of tumor blood vessels and subsequently cause tumor cell death due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. This makes it a potential therapy for solid tumors, such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancer. Combretastatin A-1 has also been studied in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, and results have shown that it can enhance the efficacy of these drugs. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of Combretastatin A-1 and its potential as a cancer therapy. Currently, it is not yet approved for use in clinical practice.",
