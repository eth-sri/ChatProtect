  "text": "The band consisted of Sergio Chotsourian on vocals and guitar, Walter Broide on bass, and Gonzalo Villagra on drums. Los Natas gained a reputation for their live performances, which were characterized by their energetic and improvisational style. They were also known for their use of stoner rock and doom metal elements in their music. Over the course of their career, Los Natas released several albums, including \"Delmar\" (1998), \"Munchen Sessions\" (2001), \"Toba Trance\" (2009), and \"Nuevo Orden de la Libertad\" (2015). They disbanded in 2012, but their influence can still be heard in the psychedelic and stoner rock scenes in Argentina and around the world.",
