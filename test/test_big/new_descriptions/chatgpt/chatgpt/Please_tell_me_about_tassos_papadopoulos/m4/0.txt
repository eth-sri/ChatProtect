  "text": "Tassos Papadopoulos (1934-2008) was a Cypriot politician who served as the President of Cyprus from 2003 to 2008. Tassos Papadopoulos studied law in the UK. He played an important role in the independence struggle of Cyprus from British colonial rule. Papadopoulos served as the President of the House of Representatives of Cyprus from 1996 to 2003 and became President of Cyprus in 2003 after winning a run-off election. During his presidency, he took a tough stance on the country's negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community, believing that a solution to the Cyprus problem must respect the Greek-Cypriot majority. He was also known for his efforts to strengthen Cyprus' economy, reduce unemployment, and promote sustainable development. Papadopoulos was criticized for his handling of the 2003 Pan-European Games, which incurred significant financial losses. Papadopoulos died in 2008 due to lung cancer, leaving behind a legacy of a passionate proponent of a united and independent Cyprus.",
