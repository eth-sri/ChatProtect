  "prompt": "Please tell me about Blohm & Voss P.188",
  "text": "The P.188 was a large aircraft, with a wingspan of over 44 meters (144 feet) and a length of over 23 meters (75 feet). The aircraft was designed with a pressurized cockpit and advanced radar and camera equipment. It was designed to have a crew of two. However, the P.188 never went beyond the design stage, as the war ended before it could be built. Only a few design drawings and models remain today, and the P.188 is considered a curiosity of aviation history.",
