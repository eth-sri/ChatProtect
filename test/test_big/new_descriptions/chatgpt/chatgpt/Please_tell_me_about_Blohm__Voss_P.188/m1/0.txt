  "prompt": "Please tell me about Blohm & Voss P.188",
  "text": "It had a wingspan of 82 ft 8 in (25.2 m) and a length of 62 ft 5 in (19.0 m). The P.188 was designed to operate at low altitudes, which made it difficult for enemy fighters to intercept. Despite its advanced design, the P.188 never entered full production due to the end of the war. Only four prototypes were built, and no P.188s saw active service.",
