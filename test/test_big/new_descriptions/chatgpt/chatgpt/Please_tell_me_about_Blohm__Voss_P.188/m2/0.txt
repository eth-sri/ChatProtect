  "prompt": "Please tell me about Blohm & Voss P.188",
  "text": "The Blohm & Voss P.188 was a German jet-powered aircraft designed during World War II. The Blohm & Voss P.188 was designed to be capable of delivering a variety of munitions, including bombs, rockets, and torpedoes. It had a wingspan of 82 ft 8 in (25.2 m) and a length of 62 ft 5 in (19.0 m). The P.188 was capable of carrying a bomb load of up to 4,409 lb (2,000 kg). The P.188 was designed to operate at low altitudes, which made it difficult for enemy fighters to intercept. The P.188 was equipped with advanced navigational equipment, including radar and a ground mapping system, which made it capable of operating in any weather conditions. Despite its advanced design, the P.188 never entered full production due to the end of the war. Only four prototypes were built, and no P.188s saw active service.",
