The Blohm & Voss P.188 was a projected German high altitude reconnaissance plane during World War II. The aircraft was designed with a pressurized cockpit and advanced radar and camera equipment. It was designed to have a crew of two. However, the P.188 never went beyond the design stage, as the war ended before it could be built. Only a few design drawings and models remain today, and the P.188 is considered a curiosity of aviation history.",
