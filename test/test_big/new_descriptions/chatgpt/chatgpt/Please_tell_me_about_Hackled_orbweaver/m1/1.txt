  "prompt": "Please tell me about Hackled orb-weaver",
  "text": "They are found in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The hackled orb-weaver is known for its unique web-building technique and its ability to produce silk with a low stickiness, which allows it to trap only larger prey. As its name suggests, the hackled orb-weaver spins orb webs. However, unlike most orb-weaving spiders, it does not use sticky silk to catch its prey. Instead, it spins a frame of non-sticky silk and then weaves radiating threads on it. The radiating threads of the web act like a fishnet that captures insects and other prey that come into contact with them. The hackled orb-weaver then paralyzes its prey with venomous bites and wraps it in silk for later consumption. The hackled orb-weaver is a relatively small spider, with females growing up to about 10mm in body length. The males are smaller, reaching up to only about 6mm. Overall, the hackled orb-weaver is a fascinating species of spider that has adapted a unique web-building technique to catch its prey. Despite being venomous, it poses no threat to humans and is a beneficial predator that helps control insect populations.",
