  "prompt": "Please tell me about Follower (Australian rules football)",
  "text": "Follower is a position in Australian rules football that is also known as a ruckman or ruck rover. The player in this position is typically positioned in the centre of the ground, and their primary role is to contest the rucking duels at stoppages and clear the ball to their team's advantage. Followers are usually tall and have a good jumping ability, as well as strong marking skills. They are responsible for out-jumping the opposition ruckman and either tapping the ball to their own advantage or directing it to a teammate. They must also be quick and agile enough to follow up their tap work and win the ball on the ground. In modern football, followers also have an important role in defensive and offensive structures. They may be required to drop back and act as a sweeper, intercepting opposition attacks and helping to clear the ball out of defence. Alternatively, they might push forward and provide a target for their team's forwards. Some of the greatest followers in Australian football history include Polly Farmer, John Nicholls, Simon Madden, Dean Cox, and Nic Naitanui.",
