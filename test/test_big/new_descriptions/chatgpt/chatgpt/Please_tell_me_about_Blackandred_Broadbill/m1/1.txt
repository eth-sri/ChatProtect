  "prompt": "Please tell me about Black-and-red Broadbill",
  "text": "The Black-and-red Broadbill (Cymbirhynchus macrorhynchos) is a small, colorful bird found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It has a distinctive black head and wings, red breast and belly, and a bright blue beak. It is also known to eat small fruits and berries. This bird is known for its elaborate courtship displays, in which it performs a series of acrobatic dives and flips in the air to attract a mate. The female then builds a small nest made of twigs and foliage, typically located in the upper branches of a tree. Although the Black-and-red Broadbill is not currently considered endangered, habitat destruction is a major threat to its population. Logging, agriculture, and other forms of human development are causing significant habitat loss throughout its range. Conservation efforts, including protected areas and reforestation projects, are aimed at preserving this species for future generations.",
