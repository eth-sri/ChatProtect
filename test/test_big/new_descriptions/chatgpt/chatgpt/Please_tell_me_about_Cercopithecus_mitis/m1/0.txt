  "text": "They have a distinctive bluish-grey coat with a white belly, and their eyes are surrounded by a black patch of fur. They have a long, slender tail, which they use for balance while moving through the trees. Blue monkeys are social animals that live in groups. These groups typically consist of a dominant male and several females and their offspring. They communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, flowers, and insects. They play an important role in the forest ecosystem by dispersing seeds in their feces. Blue monkeys are not currently considered endangered, although their populations are decreasing due to habitat loss and hunting for meat. They are protected in many national parks and reserves throughout their range.",
