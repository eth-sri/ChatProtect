  "prompt": "Please tell me about General-Feldwachtmeister",
  "text": "General-Feldwachtmeister is a German term that roughly translates to \"General Field Sergeant Major\" in English. It is a military rank used by several branches of the German military, including the army and air force. In the German army, the rank of General-Feldwachtmeister is equivalent to the NATO rank code OR-9. This rank is typically held by an experienced senior NCO who has demonstrated exceptional leadership and tactical skills. It is also worth noting that the rank of General-Feldwachtmeister is not commonly used in modern German military structures. Instead, the highest non-commissioned officer rank in use today is Oberstabsfeldwebel. Overall, the General-Feldwachtmeister rank played an important role in the German military during past conflicts, but has since become largely obsolete.",
