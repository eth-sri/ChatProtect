  "prompt": "Please tell me about General-Feldwachtmeister",
  "text": "General-Feldwachtmeister was a military rank in German armies, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries. The duties of a General-Feldwachtmeister varied depending on the time period and the army they served in, but generally, they were responsible for overseeing the organization and administration of the military units they were assigned to. They were also tasked with maintaining discipline and morale within their units and serving as a liaison between their unit and higher-ranking officers. In addition to their military duties, General-Feldwachtmeisters often had social and ceremonial responsibilities as part of their role as officers. The rank was replaced by the equivalent rank of Oberstleutnant in the German Army.",
