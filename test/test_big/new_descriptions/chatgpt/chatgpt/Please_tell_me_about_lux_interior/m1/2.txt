Over the course of his career, Lux Interior released numerous albums and singles with The Cramps, including \"Songs the Lord Taught Us\" and \"Psychedelic Jungle.\" He was widely regarded as a pioneer of the punk rock and psychobilly genres, and his influence can be heard in the music of many other artists.
