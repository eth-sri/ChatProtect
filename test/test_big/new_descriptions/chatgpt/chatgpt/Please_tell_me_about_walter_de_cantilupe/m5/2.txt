He was involved in many charitable works, including the foundation of hospitals and almshouses. As Bishop of Hereford, Cantilupe supported King Edward I in his wars against Scotland and Wales. However, he also clashed with the king over issues of jurisdiction and taxation. Cantilupe was also involved in the politics of the period, serving as a mediator between the king and the barons during the Constitutional Crisis of 1297-1298. After his death, Cantilupe was venerated as a saint by many in the English Church. He was canonized by Pope John XXII in 1320, becoming one of only two English bishops to be canonized in the Middle Ages.",
