  "text": "Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328) was a prominent Islamic scholar and theologian born in Harran in what is now northeastern Turkey. He received a traditional Islamic education and was particularly interested in Islamic law (fiqh) and theology (aqidah). Ibn Taymiyyah was known for his strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) and is often associated with the Salafi movement. He was critical of Sufism and other forms of popular Islam, and believed that Muslim practices should be based solely on textual evidence. Ibn Taymiyyah wrote extensively on a variety of topics and is best known for his works on Islamic law and theology. His most famous works include \"Majmu' al-Fatawa\" and \"Kitab al-Tawhid\". Ibn Taymiyyah was also known for his political activism. He opposed the Mongol invasions of the Muslim lands and encouraged Muslims to resist the invading armies. He was also critical of the rulers of his time, whom he believed were corrupt and misguided. Ibn Taymiyyah died in prison in Damascus, where he had been imprisoned for his views. Despite his controversial ideas, he remains an influential figure in Islamic thought and is revered by some as a great reformer.",
