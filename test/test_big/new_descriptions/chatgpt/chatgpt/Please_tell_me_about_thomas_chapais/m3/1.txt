He became a member of the Royal Society of Canada. Chapais authored many books and articles on Canadian history, particularly on the history of Quebec. Thomas Chapais is best known for his three-volume work titled \"Cours d'histoire du Canada\" (History of Canada), which was published between 1919 and 1930 and is still considered a classic in Canadian historical scholarship. Chapais was also a professor of history at Laval University and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Montreal in 1919.
