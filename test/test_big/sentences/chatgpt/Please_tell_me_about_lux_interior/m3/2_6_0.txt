Lux Interior was known for his unique and provocative onstage presence, which often involved contorting his body and screaming in a wild, animalistic manner. He was also known for his love of vintage rock and roll and garage rock, which heavily influenced The Cramps' sound. Over the course of his career, Lux Interior released numerous albums and singles with The Cramps, including \"Songs the Lord Taught Us\" and \"Psychedelic Jungle.\" He was widely regarded as a pioneer of the punk rock and psychobilly genres, and his influence can be heard in the music of many other artists.",
