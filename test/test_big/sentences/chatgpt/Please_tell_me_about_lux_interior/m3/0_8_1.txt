  "prefix": "Lux Interior (born Erick Lee Purkhiser) was an American musician and the lead singer of the garage punk band The Cramps. He was born on October 21, 1946, in Stow, Ohio, USA and died on February 4, 2009, in Glendale, California, USA. Interior formed The Cramps in 1976 with his longtime partner and wife, Poison Ivy Rorschach. The band's sound and image were deeply influenced by 1950s rock and roll, horror movies, and vintage rhythm and blues. Interior's wild onstage performances, characterized by his howling vocals, frantic dancing, and provocative outfits, made him a legendary figure in the punk and underground music scenes. Throughout his career, Interior released numerous albums with The Cramps, including \"Songs the Lord Taught Us\" (1980), \"Psychedelic Jungle\" (1981), \"Stay Sick!\" (1990), and \"Big Beat from Badsville\" (1997). The band remained active until the mid-2000s, a few years before Interior's death at the age of 62.",
