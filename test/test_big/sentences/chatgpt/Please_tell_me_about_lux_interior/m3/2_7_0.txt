  "prefix": "Lux Interior was the stage name of Erick Lee Purkhiser (October 21, 1946 \u2013 February 4, 2009), an American singer and musician. He was the lead vocalist of the punk rock band The Cramps, which was formed with his wife, Poison Ivy, in 1976. Lux Interior was known for his unique and provocative onstage presence, which often involved contorting his body and screaming in a wild, animalistic manner. He was also known for his love of vintage rock and roll and garage rock, which heavily influenced The Cramps' sound. Over the course of his career, Lux Interior released numerous albums and singles with The Cramps, including \"Songs the Lord Taught Us\" and \"Psychedelic Jungle.\" He was widely regarded as a pioneer of the punk rock and psychobilly genres, and his influence can be heard in the music of many other artists. Lux Interior passed away in 2009 at the age of 62, due to complications from aortic dissection.",
