It was released in 2018, but gained a significant amount of popularity in 2020 due to many content creators streaming the game on Twitch and other streaming platforms. The game allows players to play as crewmates on a spaceship, with one or more of them being designated as impostors. The crewmates must perform tasks while the impostors try to sabotage their efforts and kill them without being caught. The game requires players to use deception, strategy, and communication with other players to find out who the impostors are and vote them off the spaceship. The game can be played with four to ten players and is available on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.",
