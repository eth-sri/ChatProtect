It was released in 2018 but gained widespread popularity in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of streaming platforms. The game is set on a spaceship where players take on the roles of crewmates or imposters. The crewmates' objective is to complete tasks around the ship and identify and eject any imposters among them before they sabotage the ship and kill everyone. On the other hand, the imposter's goal is to blend in with the crew and sabotage the ship while trying to secretly eliminate the crewmates one by one. Players have to use deduction skills, deception, and communication to figure out who the imposters are.",
