  "prefix": "Among Us is an online multiplayer game developed by InnerSloth. It was released in 2018, but gained significant popularity in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of streaming platforms like Twitch. The game is set on a spaceship and players are placed in a crew, with one or more players secretly designated as impostors whose goal is to kill the crew. The crewmates must complete tasks while navigating the ship, and if they find a dead body, they can report it and initiate a discussion to try to identify the impostor(s) before they kill again. The impostors must try to sabotage the ship and kill crewmates without being caught. The game has gained a massive following due to its easy-to-learn gameplay, unpredictable nature, and social interaction required for effective gameplay. It has been praised for allowing players to be creative in their deception and tactics, and has become a sort of social experiment in which players try to tell when someone is lying or trying to manipulate the group.",
