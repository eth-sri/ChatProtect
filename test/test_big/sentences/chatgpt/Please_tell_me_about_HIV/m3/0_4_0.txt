HIV targets and destroys CD4 cells, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. As the virus destroys more and more CD4 cells, the immune system becomes weakened, making the person vulnerable to life-threatening infections and cancers. HIV is spread through certain bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk.",
