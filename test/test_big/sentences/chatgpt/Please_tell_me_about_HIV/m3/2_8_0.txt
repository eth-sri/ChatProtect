  "prefix": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases. It is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. The most common mode of transmission is through unprotected sexual contact with an infected person or through sharing needles, syringes or other injection equipment used to inject drugs. HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), which is the final stage of the infection. AIDS is a condition that weakens the immune system and makes it more susceptible to life-threatening infections and cancers. There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS, but antiretroviral medication can help manage the virus and prevent it from progressing to AIDS. Preventing HIV involves avoiding risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and sharing needles. It is also recommended to get regular HIV testing and to take medication to prevent HIV if at high risk (such as pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP).",
