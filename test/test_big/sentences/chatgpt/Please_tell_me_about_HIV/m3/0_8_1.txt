  "prefix": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, which is the body's natural defense system against diseases. HIV targets and destroys CD4 cells, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. As the virus destroys more and more CD4 cells, the immune system becomes weakened, making the person vulnerable to life-threatening infections and cancers. HIV is spread through certain bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. HIV transmission can occur during unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles or syringes with an infected person, or during childbirth or breastfeeding from an infected mother. There is currently no cure for HIV, but there are effective treatments that can help people with HIV live long, healthy lives. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) helps to suppress the virus and prevent the progression of HIV to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), a stage of the disease when the immune system is severely compromised. Preventing HIV transmission is also key in controlling the spread of the virus.",
