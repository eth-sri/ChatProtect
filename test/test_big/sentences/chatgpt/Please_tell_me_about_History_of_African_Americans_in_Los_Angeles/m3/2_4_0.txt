  "prefix": "The history of African Americans in Los Angeles dates back to the 19th century when a small community of black settlers settled in the city. Most of these early black settlers came from the south in search of better opportunities and to escape racial discrimination and segregation. In the early 20th century, the African American population in Los Angeles grew rapidly as more blacks migrated to the city from the south. The city became a hub for black culture and entertainment, with many famous jazz clubs, theaters, and restaurants located in predominantly black neighborhoods like Watts and Central Avenue.",
