  "prefix": "The history of African Americans in Los Angeles dates back to the founding of the city in 1781, when a group of early settlers included a mixed-race African American man named Antonio Mesa. Throughout the 19th century, the African American population in Los Angeles grew slowly but steadily, with many prominent figures emerging, such as artist Charles White and civil rights leader Dr. Christopher Darden. In the early 20th century, African Americans faced discrimination and segregation in housing, education, and employment.",
