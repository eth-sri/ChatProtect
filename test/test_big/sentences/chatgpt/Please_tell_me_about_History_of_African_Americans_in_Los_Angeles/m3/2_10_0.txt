  "prefix": "The history of African Americans in Los Angeles dates back to the 19th century when a small community of black settlers settled in the city. Most of these early black settlers came from the south in search of better opportunities and to escape racial discrimination and segregation. In the early 20th century, the African American population in Los Angeles grew rapidly as more blacks migrated to the city from the south. The city became a hub for black culture and entertainment, with many famous jazz clubs, theaters, and restaurants located in predominantly black neighborhoods like Watts and Central Avenue. Despite this thriving cultural scene, racial discrimination and segregation were also prevalent in Los Angeles. Many African Americans faced housing discrimination and were forced to live in overcrowded and substandard housing, especially in the Watts and South Central neighborhoods. During the civil rights movement in the 1960s, African Americans in Los Angeles played a key role in the struggle for equal rights and integration. The Watts Riots of 1965, sparked by police brutality and years of social and economic injustice, brought attention to the plight of black residents in the city. In the decades that followed, African American communities in Los Angeles continued to face challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and gang violence. However, the city also saw the rise of black political power and the election of African American mayors and city council members.",
