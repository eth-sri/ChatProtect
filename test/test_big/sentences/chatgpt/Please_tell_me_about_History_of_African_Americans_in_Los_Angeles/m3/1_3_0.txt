Throughout the 19th century, the African American population in Los Angeles grew slowly but steadily, with many prominent figures emerging, such as artist Charles White and civil rights leader Dr. Christopher Darden. In the early 20th century, African Americans faced discrimination and segregation in housing, education, and employment.",
