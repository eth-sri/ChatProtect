  "prefix": "The history of African Americans in Los Angeles dates back to the early 20th century, when a small number of African Americans moved to the area to work in the fields and factories. They faced discrimination and segregation in employment, housing, and education, but they also formed close-knit communities and established a rich cultural heritage. In the 1930s and 1940s, the African American population in Los Angeles began to grow rapidly, fueled by the Great Migration from the South and the demand for labor in the defense industry during World War II.",
