  "prefix": "Entity-relationship (ER) models are graphical representations used in software engineering and database design. They are used to represent the relationships between different entities or objects in a system. The ER model is a conceptual model that represents the data requirements for a system. It is used to design a database and is often used as a starting point for database design projects. In an ER model, entities are represented as rectangles with their attribute values displayed within the rectangle. Relationships between entities are depicted by lines that link the entities. Cardinality notation is used to indicate the relationships between entities and the number of occurrences that can exist on either side of the relationship. Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. ER models are useful because they help designers to visualize the data flow in complex systems and identify the relationships between entities.",
