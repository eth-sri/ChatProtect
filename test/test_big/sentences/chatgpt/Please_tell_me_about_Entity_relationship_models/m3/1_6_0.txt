They are used to represent the relationships between different entities or objects in a system. The ER model is a conceptual model that represents the data requirements for a system. It is used to design a database and is often used as a starting point for database design projects. In an ER model, entities are represented as rectangles with their attribute values displayed within the rectangle. Relationships between entities are depicted by lines that link the entities.",
