  "prefix": "An entity-relationship (ER) model is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other. It is used to design and represent data in a database system. The basic components of an ER model are entities, attributes, and relationships. Entities represent objects or concepts in the real world, while attributes define the characteristics of those entities (such as name, age, or address). Relationships describe the connections or associations between entities (such as belonging to or being related to). ER models can be represented using various notations, such as Chen notation or Crow's foot notation.",
