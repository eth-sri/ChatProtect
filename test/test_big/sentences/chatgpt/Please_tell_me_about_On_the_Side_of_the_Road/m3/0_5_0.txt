The film features interviews with elderly Israelis who witnessed the events of 1948, as well as with younger Israelis who are grappling with this history and its aftermath. The film also explores the government policies and actions that have perpetuated the displacement of Palestinians and the ongoing conflict in the region. On the Side of the Road received critical acclaim for its honest and nuanced portrayal of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its impact on Israeli society.",
