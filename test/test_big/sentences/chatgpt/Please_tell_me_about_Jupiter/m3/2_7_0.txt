  "prefix": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest planet in our solar system. It's a gas giant, meaning it's mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of other gases like methane and ammonia. Its atmosphere is characterized by colorful bands of clouds, including the famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than the size of Earth. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, with the most intense magnetic field of any planet in our solar system. It also has an extensive system of moons, the largest of which is Ganymede, the only moon in our solar system known to have its own magnetic field. Jupiter is a very important planet for the study of our solar system and beyond. Research on Jupiter's atmosphere has helped to improve our understanding of other planets and even the formation of our solar system.",
