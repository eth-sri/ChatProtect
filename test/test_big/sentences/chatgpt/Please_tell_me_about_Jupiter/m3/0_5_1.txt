  "prefix": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant, meaning it is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a diameter of 86,881 miles, or 139,822 kilometers, which is more than 11 times larger than Earth. Jupiter has a very strong gravitational field, which makes it challenging for spacecraft to travel to and explore. It has 79 known moons, the largest being Ganymede, which is even larger than the planet Mercury.",
