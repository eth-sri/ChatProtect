Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, which is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Jupiter has 79 known moons, the four largest of which are known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). These moons are some of the most interesting objects in our solar system and have been the focus of many missions by NASA and other space agencies.",
