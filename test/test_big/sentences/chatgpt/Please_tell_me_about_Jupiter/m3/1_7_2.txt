  "prefix": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and is the largest planet in the solar system. It is a gas giant and is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, which is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Jupiter has 79 known moons, the four largest of which are known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). These moons are some of the most interesting objects in our solar system and have been the focus of many missions by NASA and other space agencies. Jupiter is also known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm on its surface that has been observed for over 300 years. This storm is about three times the size of Earth and has winds that can reach speeds of up to 400 miles per hour.",
