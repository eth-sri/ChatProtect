  "prefix": "Walter de Cantilupe, also known as Walter de Cantelupe, was an English bishop and lord chancellor. He was born in Hambleden, Buckinghamshire in the early 1260s and died on 18 October 1308 in Italy. He was the son of William de Cantilupe, a nobleman and sheriff of Worcestershire, and Milicent de Gournay. Walter de Cantilupe was educated at the University of Paris and then became a canon of the diocese of Hereford. In 1289, he was appointed dean of the cathedral there. He also served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1292 to 1293 under King Edward I. In 1299, Walter was elected Bishop of Worcester, and he was consecrated the following year. He was known for his generosity and his support of education, founding a school in his home town of Hambleden and establishing scholarships for students at the University of Oxford. Walter de Cantilupe was a strong advocate for the rights of the church and frequently clashed with the king over issues of jurisdiction and taxation. He was involved in the struggle between the pope and King Philip IV of France over the taxation of the clergy, and he traveled to Italy to attend the papal court. Walter de Cantilupe was canonized by Pope John XXII in 1320, becoming the first Englishman to be declared a saint since the canonization of St. Thomas Becket in 1173.",
