  "prefix": "Walter de Cantilupe served as Bishop of Worcester. He was born into a noble family and studied law at the University of Paris before beginning his career in the government of King Edward I. During his time as Chancellor, he helped to reform the royal administration and was responsible for introducing the concept of audits. He was also appointed to several diplomatic missions, negotiating treaties with the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland. In 1296, he was appointed Bishop of Worcester and worked to improve the condition of his diocese and the lives of his clergy. He founded several hospitals and provided support for the poor. He commissioned the creation of several illuminated manuscripts. In 1306, he was summoned to Parliament to help advise King Edward II, but he fell out of favour with the king after refusing to approve the appointment of his favourite, Piers Gaveston, as Earl of Cornwall. Cantilupe was later excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury for opposing the papacy's taxation of English clergy, but he was absolved before his death in 1308.",
