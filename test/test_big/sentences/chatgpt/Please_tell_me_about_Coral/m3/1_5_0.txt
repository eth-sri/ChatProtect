Coral reefs are made up of these colonies and are the largest living structures in the world. Coral reefs are very important ecosystems as they support a wide variety of marine life and provide numerous ecological services, such as nitrogen fixation and physical protection from waves and storms. Coral is also used in jewelry-making and home decor due to its unique texture and colors.",
