  "prefix": "Coral is a marine animal that belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, which includes jellyfish and sea anemones. Coral reefs are formed by colonies of coral polyps, tiny invertebrate animals, that secrete a hard, rock-like calcium carbonate skeleton. These reefs provide important habitats for many ocean creatures, such as fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Coral reefs are found in shallow, warm waters in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, and are an important part of the marine ecosystem.",
