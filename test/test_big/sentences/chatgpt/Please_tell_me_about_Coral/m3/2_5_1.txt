  "prefix": "Coral refers to the hard, marine organisms that are typically composed of the calcium carbonate skeleton of numerous individual polyps. These polyps are tiny animals that live together in colonies and are responsible for the growth and formation of coral reefs, which are some of the most diverse and important ecosystems on the planet. Coral reefs provide habitats and food for a wide variety of marine species, including fish, crabs, shrimp, and sea turtles. However, coral is also under threat from human activities such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change. Coral bleaching, a phenomenon caused by warmer sea temperatures, is also devastating coral reefs around the world.",
