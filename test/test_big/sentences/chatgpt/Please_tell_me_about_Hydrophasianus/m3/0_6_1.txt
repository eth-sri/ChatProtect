The genus includes two species: the bronze-winged duck (Hydrophasianus chrysogaster) and the white-winged duck (Hydrophasianus nigriceps). Both species are endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. The bronze-winged duck is found in Southeast Asia while the white-winged duck is found in Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian subcontinent. These ducks are characterized by their dark, glossy feathers and distinctive markings on their wings. They mainly feed on aquatic plants and insects.",
