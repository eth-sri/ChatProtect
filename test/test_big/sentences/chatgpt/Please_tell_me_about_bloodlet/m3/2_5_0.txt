Historically, it was believed that balance and harmony in the body could be restored by removing \"unhealthy\" or \"excess\" blood. This practice was used for thousands of years in many cultures around the world, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods in Europe, bloodletting was considered a common medical treatment for a wide variety of ailments, from fever and infection to mental illness and even the plague. The practice was often performed using leeches, which were applied to the patient's skin to suck out blood.",
