  "prefix": "Bloodletting is an ancient medical practice of drawing blood from a patient to cure or prevent diseases. It was believed that diseases were caused by an imbalance of four bodily fluids; blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Bloodletting was thought to correct this imbalance by removing excess blood. There are various methods of bloodletting, including the use of leeches, cupping, and venesection. Leeches were commonly used in the medieval period, as they could suck out blood without causing much pain. Cupping involves creating suction on the skin, which draws blood to the surface. Venesection is a more direct method, involving cutting a vein and allowing blood to flow out.",
