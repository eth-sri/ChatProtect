  "prefix": "Bloodletting, also known as phlebotomy, is a medical practice that involves the intentional removal of blood from a patient's body. Historically, it was believed that balance and harmony in the body could be restored by removing \"unhealthy\" or \"excess\" blood. This practice was used for thousands of years in many cultures around the world, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods in Europe, bloodletting was considered a common medical treatment for a wide variety of ailments, from fever and infection to mental illness and even the plague. The practice was often performed using leeches, which were applied to the patient's skin to suck out blood. However, as medical knowledge and technology improved, it became clear that bloodletting was not an effective or safe treatment for most conditions. In fact, the practice could often weaken patients and even cause harm or death in some cases. Today, bloodletting is only used in very limited medical situations, such as to reduce dangerously high levels of iron in the blood (hemochromatosis) or to alleviate the symptoms of certain blood disorders like polycythemia vera.",
