It was commonly used in ancient times as a means of treating a wide range of illnesses and conditions, including fever, inflammation, and infections. The practice of bloodletting was based on the ancient belief that illnesses and diseases were caused by an imbalance of the body's four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. It was believed that by removing a portion of the blood, the balance of humors could be restored, and the patient's health could be improved. Bloodletting was performed in a variety of ways, including venesection (cutting into a vein), arteriotomy (cutting into an artery), and cupping (placing a heated cup on the skin to create a vacuum that drew blood to the surface).",
