  "prefix": "The 1968-69 FA Cup qualifying rounds were a series of knockout tournaments that took place before the first round proper of the FA Cup. The qualifying rounds allowed teams from lower divisions, amateur sides, and non-league clubs to compete for a place in the world's oldest football competition. The qualifying rounds took place over six Saturdays from September 21 to October 26, 1968. A total of 430 teams took part in the qualifying rounds, including sides from the Southern League, the Northern Premier League, as well as amateur teams. The teams were divided into 43 different groups, with the winners of each group proceeding to the first round proper of the FA Cup. The qualifying rounds were fiercely contested, with many teams fighting to progress to the next stage. Notable matches included Dartford's 5-0 win over Folkestone, Wigan Athletic's 7-0 victory over Clitheroe, and Kettering Town's 6-0 win over Nuneaton Borough.",
