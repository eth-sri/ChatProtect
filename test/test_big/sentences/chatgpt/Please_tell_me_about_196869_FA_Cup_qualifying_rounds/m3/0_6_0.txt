These rounds were spread over six Saturdays, beginning on September 21, 1968, and ending on October 26, 1968. A total of 430 teams took part in the qualifying rounds, including sides from the Southern League, the Northern Premier League, as well as amateur teams. The teams were divided into 43 different groups, with the winners of each group proceeding to the first round proper of the FA Cup. The qualifying rounds were fiercely contested, with many teams fighting to progress to the next stage.",
