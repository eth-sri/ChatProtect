A total of 557 teams entered the qualifying rounds, consisting mostly of amateur and semi-professional teams from across England and Wales. The qualifying rounds were split into six rounds, with the winners of each round progressing to the next. The first qualifying round saw the entry of teams from the lower levels of the football pyramid, with teams from the higher regional leagues entering in the subsequent rounds. Some notable teams that progressed through the qualifying rounds included Telford United, who reached the third round proper, and West Bromwich Albion, who were knocked out in the first round by non-league team Wealdstone. The final qualifying round saw 40 teams competing for the final 16 spots in the first round proper, with the ties taking place over the weekend of November 16, 1968.",
