He is considered one of the greatest military commanders and conquerors in history, as he led his armies to victories in a series of epic battles that extended his empire from the Mediterranean to India. Alexander was born in 356 BC in Pella, a city in ancient Macedonia. He was the son of King Philip II of Macedon and his wife, Queen Olympia. Alexander's early education was led by the philosopher Aristotle, who taught him poetry, politics, geography, and philosophy. In 336 BC, when Alexander was just 20 years old, his father Philip II was assassinated, and Alexander became the new king of Macedonia. After consolidating his power in Greece, Alexander turned his attention to the eastern conquest.",
