  "prefix": "Alexander the Great was a king of Macedon (ancient Greece) who lived from 356 BC to 323 BC. He is widely considered one of history\u2019s greatest military strategists and conquerors. Alexander was the son of King Philip II of Macedon and received a rigorous education under the tutelage of the philosopher Aristotle. At the age of just 20, Alexander ascended to the throne after his father\u2019s assassination. In the years that followed, Alexander\u2019s military campaigns brought him unparalleled victories and territory, as he conquered Greece, Egypt, Persia, and parts of Central Asia and India. His tactics were known for combining multiple military units and for his brilliant use of cavalry during battles. Beyond his military prowess, Alexander was also known as a patron of learning, encouraging the spread of Greek culture and building many cities in the conquered territories. However, he could also be brutal in his conquests, and his empire did not long survive his death. Alexander died at the age of 32, likely due to complications from alcoholism and illness.",
