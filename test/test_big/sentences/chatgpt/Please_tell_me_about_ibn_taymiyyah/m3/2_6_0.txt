His teachings and writings were influential in shaping the religious ideology of the Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia, and he is often seen as the intellectual father of Salafism, a modern Islamic movement seeking to return to the practices of the first Islamic generations. Ibn Taymiyyah was known for his strict adherence to the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad). He was critical of many traditional practices within Islam, including the veneration of saints and the use of intermediary figures in religious practices. Ibn Taymiyyah's writings also touched on political and social issues.",
