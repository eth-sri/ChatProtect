  "prefix": "Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328) was a prominent Islamic scholar and theologian from Damascus, Syria. He is known for his conservative and strict interpretation of Islam and his rejection of any innovations not supported by the Quran and Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). He was particularly critical of Sufism, a mystical and esoteric branch of Islam. Ibn Taymiyyah was also known for his political activism, and he was known to speak out against the Mongol invasion of the Muslim world and the corruption of the ruling elites. He was imprisoned several times for his outspoken views and died in prison in Damascus in 1328. Ibn Taymiyyah is still highly regarded among conservative and Salafi Muslims, who view him as a strong defender of Islamic orthodoxy and a beacon of true Islamic values.",
