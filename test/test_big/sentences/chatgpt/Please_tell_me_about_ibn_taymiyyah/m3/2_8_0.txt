  "prefix": "Ibn Taymiyyah was a medieval Islamic scholar born in 1263 in Harran, located in present-day Turkey. He is considered to be one of the most controversial figures in Islamic history. His teachings and writings were influential in shaping the religious ideology of the Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia, and he is often seen as the intellectual father of Salafism, a modern Islamic movement seeking to return to the practices of the first Islamic generations. Ibn Taymiyyah was known for his strict adherence to the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad). He was critical of many traditional practices within Islam, including the veneration of saints and the use of intermediary figures in religious practices. Ibn Taymiyyah's writings also touched on political and social issues. He was known for his support of the concept of tawheed (the oneness of God) and his opposition to the idea of shirk, which is the worship of other gods besides Allah. He was also critical of the Mongol invasion of the Middle East and called for military resistance against them.",
