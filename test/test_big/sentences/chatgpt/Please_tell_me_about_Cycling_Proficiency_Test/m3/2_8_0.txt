  "prefix": "Cycling Proficiency Test is a program designed to assess and improve the cycling skills and knowledge of children and young adults. It is usually conducted by local councils or schools and is aimed at children aged 10-12 years old. The test consists of two sections - a theory test and a practical test. The theory test assesses the participant's knowledge of the Highway Code and basic road safety rules. The practical test assesses their cycling ability and their understanding of traffic signals and road signs. Participants who successfully pass both tests are awarded a certificate and a badge, which signifies their proficiency in cycling and their commitment to road safety. The program is designed to equip children with basic cycling skills and knowledge, and to promote safe cycling practices on the road. In recent years, the program has become less popular due to increased bike lanes, cycling trails, and lower overall traffic in many areas.",
