It was first introduced in the UK in the 1940s, and it was later adopted by other countries around the world. The training usually includes things like bike safety checks, road positioning, signaling, and maneuvering through various traffic scenarios. The participants also receive a booklet that contains the highway code and guidelines for safe cycling. At the end of the training, the participants are given a test to assess their proficiency. The test usually involves a practical assessment where the candidate is taken through a cycling route that tests their knowledge and practical application of the training.",
