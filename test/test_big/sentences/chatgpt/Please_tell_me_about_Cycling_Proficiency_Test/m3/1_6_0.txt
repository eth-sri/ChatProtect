  "prefix": "Cycling proficiency test is a national program in the United Kingdom aimed at teaching children in primary and secondary school how to ride a bike safely, using the road networks, and traffic rules. It was introduced in 1947 and was originally called the 'Cycle Safety Test.' The test aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills they need to stay safe while cycling on the road. It covers various aspects of riding, such as signaling, turning, and braking. It also teaches children how to be aware of other road users, how to navigate junctions and roundabouts, and how to ride in a group. There are three levels of proficiency tests that children can take, and they are usually carried out by trained instructors who are often local police officers or volunteers.",
