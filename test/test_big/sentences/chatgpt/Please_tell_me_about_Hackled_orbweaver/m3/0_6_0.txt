They are found in various parts of the world including North America, Europe, and Asia. One of the most common species of hackled orb-weavers is Araneus marmoreus, also known as the Marbled Orb-weaver. They are typically found in gardens, forests, and other wooded areas. They are easily recognized by their brightly colored patterned abdomen, which is typically white or beige with black or brown markings. Hackled orb-weavers are not dangerous to humans.",
