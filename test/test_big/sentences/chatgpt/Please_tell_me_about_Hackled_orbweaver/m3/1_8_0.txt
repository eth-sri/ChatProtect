  "prefix": "The hackled orb-weaver, also known as Uloborus plumipes, is a spider species that belongs to the family Uloboridae. They are found in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The hackled orb-weaver is known for its unique web-building technique and its ability to produce silk with a low stickiness, which allows it to trap only larger prey. As its name suggests, the hackled orb-weaver spins orb webs. However, unlike most orb-weaving spiders, it does not use sticky silk to catch its prey. Instead, it spins a frame of non-sticky silk and then weaves radiating threads on it. The radiating threads of the web act like a fishnet that captures insects and other prey that come into contact with them. The hackled orb-weaver then paralyzes its prey with venomous bites and wraps it in silk for later consumption.",
