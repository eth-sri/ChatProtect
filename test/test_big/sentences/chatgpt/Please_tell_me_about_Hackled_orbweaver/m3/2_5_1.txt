Hackled orb-weavers are typically less than 5mm in body length and are characterized by their shiny, golden brown or reddish-brown coloration. They have two rows of humps on their backs and long, slender legs with tufted hairs. Despite their small size, they are incredibly efficient at spinning their webs and are active hunters in their surroundings.",
