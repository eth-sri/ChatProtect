  "prefix": "Hackled orb-weavers are a family of spiders (Araneidae) that are known for building orb-shaped webs to catch their prey. They are found in various parts of the world including North America, Europe, and Asia. One of the most common species of hackled orb-weavers is Araneus marmoreus, also known as the Marbled Orb-weaver. They are typically found in gardens, forests, and other wooded areas. They are easily recognized by their brightly colored patterned abdomen, which is typically white or beige with black or brown markings. Hackled orb-weavers are not dangerous to humans. They feed on insects, particularly moths and flies, which they catch in their webs. The webs are usually built in areas where there is plenty of insect activity, such as near lights or in gardens where there are flowers.",
