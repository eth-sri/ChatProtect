The organization was founded in the 1980s and grew out of the Iona Community, a Christian group that emphasizes social justice and inclusivity. WGRG shares these values and works to promote a more open and welcoming approach to religion. Some of the resources that WGRG offers include books, music, prayers, and worship services. They also host events and retreats that bring people together to explore their faith and connect with others. One of the unique aspects of WGRG is their use of the symbol of the Wild Goose.
