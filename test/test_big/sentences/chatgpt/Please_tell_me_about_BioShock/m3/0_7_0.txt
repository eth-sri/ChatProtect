It was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, and later for PlayStation 3 and other platforms. The game is set in 1960 and takes place in an underwater city called Rapture, which was originally built as a utopia for society's elite to escape the \"petty morality\" of the surface world. However, the city has since fallen into chaos after a genetically-enhancing substance called ADAM is discovered, leading to the creation of powerful \"Splicers\" and other horrific mutations. The player takes on the role of Jack, a man who finds himself stranded in Rapture and must fight his way through its dangerous inhabitants while unraveling the secrets of the city and its mysterious founder, Andrew Ryan. Along the way, Jack can use a variety of weapons and abilities, including plasmids that grant him superhuman powers like telekinesis and pyrokinesis. BioShock is known for its intricate story, immersive atmosphere, and philosophical themes exploring Objectivism and the consequences of unchecked scientific progress.",
