It was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, and later for PlayStation 3 and other platforms. The game is set in 1960 and takes place in an underwater city called Rapture, which was originally built as a utopia for society's elite to escape the \"petty morality\" of the surface world. However, the city has since fallen into chaos after a genetically-enhancing substance called ADAM is discovered, leading to the creation of powerful \"Splicers\" and other horrific mutations. The player takes on the role of Jack, a man who finds himself stranded in Rapture and must fight his way through its dangerous inhabitants while unraveling the secrets of the city and its mysterious founder, Andrew Ryan.",
