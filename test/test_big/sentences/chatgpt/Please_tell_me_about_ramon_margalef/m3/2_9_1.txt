He was also a leading figure in the development of the science of ecology in Spain. Margalef was born in Barcelona, Spain, and studied biology at the University of Barcelona. He later obtained a PhD in botany from the University of Madrid. Throughout his career, Margalef was particularly interested in the relationships between organisms and their environment, and he conducted research on a wide range of ecosystems, including marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. He was especially interested in phytoplankton, the microscopic plants that play a key role in the food webs of many aquatic ecosystems. Margalef was also a passionate advocate for environmental conservation and sustainability. He believed that environmental science had an important role to play in promoting these values, and he worked tirelessly to promote conservation and scientific study of the natural world. Among his many achievements, Margalef was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Scientific and Technical Research in 1991, and he was named a Doctor Honoris Causa by several universities.",
