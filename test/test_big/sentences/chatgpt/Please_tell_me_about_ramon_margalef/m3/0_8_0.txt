  "prefix": "Ramon Margalef (1919-2004) was a Spanish biologist, ecologist, and limnologist. He is considered one of the founding fathers of modern ecology and played a crucial role in the development of the science of ecology and the study of aquatic ecosystems. Margalef was born on May 16, 1919, in Barcelona, Spain. He studied biology at the University of Barcelona, where he earned his doctorate in 1946. He then spent time studying and working at several research facilities throughout Europe, including in France, Germany, and Switzerland, before returning to Spain to become a professor of ecology at the University of Barcelona. In addition to his academic career, he served as the director of the Institute of Marine Sciences of Barcelona from 1965 to 1986. Margalef was known for his pioneering work in the study of aquatic ecosystems, especially in the areas of phytoplankton ecology and ecosystem theory. He developed several models for understanding the dynamics and structure of ecosystems and was one of the first scientists to recognize the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health and function.",
