He played an important role in the independence struggle of Cyprus from British colonial rule. Papadopoulos served as the President of the House of Representatives of Cyprus from 1996 to 2003 and became President of Cyprus in 2003 after winning a run-off election. During his presidency, he took a tough stance on the country's negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community, believing that a solution to the Cyprus problem must respect the Greek-Cypriot majority.",
