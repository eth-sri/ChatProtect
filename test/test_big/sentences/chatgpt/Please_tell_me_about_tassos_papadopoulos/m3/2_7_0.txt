  "prefix": "Tassos Papadopoulos was a prominent Cypriot politician who served as the President of the Republic of Cyprus from 2003 until 2008. He was born in Nicosia in 1934 and studied law at King's College in London. Papadopoulos was a prominent member of the left-wing AKEL party but left the party in 2003 to form his own political party, the Democratic Party. He was known for his strong stance on the reunification of Cyprus and opposed any decisions that would lead to the partition of the island. During his presidency, Papadopoulos played a central role in the negotiations to reunify Cyprus. However, his presidency was also marked by controversy, particularly in relation to allegations of corruption and the handling of the 2004 Annan Plan for the reunification of Cyprus, which was ultimately rejected by the majority of Cypriots in a referendum. Papadopoulos died in December 2008, at the age of 74, after a long battle with lung cancer.",
