Papadopoulos served as the President of the House of Representatives of Cyprus from 1996 to 2003 and became President of Cyprus in 2003 after winning a run-off election. During his presidency, he took a tough stance on the country's negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community, believing that a solution to the Cyprus problem must respect the Greek-Cypriot majority.
