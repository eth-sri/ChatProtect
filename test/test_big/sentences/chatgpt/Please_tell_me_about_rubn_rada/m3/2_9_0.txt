Born in 1943 in Montevideo, Rada gained fame in the 1970s and 1980s with his innovative blend of Afro-Uruguayan candombe rhythms, jazz, and rock and roll. Rada started his music career as a drummer, playing in various local bands in Montevideo. In 1963, he joined the Afro-Uruguayan group Hot Blowers, which played a fusion of jazz and candombe music. He later became a member of the popular Uruguayan band Totem. In the 1970s, Rada moved to Argentina and eventually to Brazil, where he continued to develop his unique musical style and worked with prominent Brazilian musicians. He played with musicians such as Jorge Ben Jor, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso, and recorded several albums of his own. Rada's music is characterized by its mix of African, Brazilian, and Uruguayan rhythms, as well as his soulful vocals and innovative approach to instrumentation. His blend of candombe, rock, and jazz influenced many other Latin American musicians and helped to create the Afro-Latin genre.",
