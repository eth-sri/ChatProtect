  "prefix": "The Argentina men's national ice hockey team is a relatively new national team, having been established in 2020 by the Argentine Ice Hockey Federation. The team is currently ranked 45th in the world by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Due to lack of infrastructure and funding, the team has only played in a limited number of international tournaments, mostly playing in lower-level tournaments such as the IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia and the IIHF Latin American Challenge Cup. The team is composed mostly of Argentine players who have developed their skills playing ice hockey overseas, particularly in North America. However, the team has also welcomed players from other Latin American countries such as Chile, Brazil, and Mexico.",
