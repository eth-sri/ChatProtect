  "prefix": "As an AI language model, I assume you are asking about minuscule representation in mathematics. In mathematics, minuscule representation refers to a specific type of mapping between a Lie group and its Lie algebra. More specifically, a minuscule representation of a simple Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional representation with the property that every non-zero weight is a multiple of a single fundamental weight.",
