  "prefix": "As an AI language model, I assume you are talking about the minuscule representation of letters in handwriting or calligraphy. Minuscule letters refer to the small letters that are used in European languages such as English, French, German, and Spanish. These letters evolved from the ancient Roman cursive script, which was a handwriting style used in the Roman Empire around the 1st century BC. Minuscule script is characterized by its rounded and curved shapes that are easier to write quickly than the straight lines of the earlier majuscule or capital letters. It was during the Carolingian period (8th \u2013 10th centuries) that the minuscule script became highly standardized and greatly enhanced the legibility of written texts.",
