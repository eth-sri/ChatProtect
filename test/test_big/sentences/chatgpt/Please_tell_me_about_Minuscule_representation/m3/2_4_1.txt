  "prefix": "Minuscule representation is a specific type of handwriting style that was used in medieval Europe, particularly in the Byzantine Empire. It is characterized by small, carefully crafted lowercase letters that were often written in a cursive style. This writing style was used primarily for copying and transcribing religious texts such as the New Testament and the Psalms, and therefore it was important for the scribes to be able to write quickly and accurately. The use of minuscule allowed them to write more efficiently because the smaller letters required less space on the page than the larger uppercase letters.",
