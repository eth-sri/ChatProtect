  "orig": "Overall, minuscule is a significant part of the history of handwriting and the bookmaking process, as it allowed scribes to produce more accurate and legible texts in a shorter amount of time.",
  "alt": "It allowed scribes to write more quickly and efficiently because the smaller letters required less space on the page than the larger uppercase letters.",
  "prefix": "Minuscule representation is a specific type of handwriting style that was used in medieval Europe, particularly in the Byzantine Empire. It is characterized by small, carefully crafted lowercase letters that were often written in a cursive style. This writing style was used primarily for copying and transcribing religious texts such as the New Testament and the Psalms, and therefore it was important for the scribes to be able to write quickly and accurately. The use of minuscule allowed them to write more efficiently because the smaller letters required less space on the page than the larger uppercase letters. Minuscule also played an important role in the development of the Latin alphabet, as it helped to establish a standardized form for the lowercase letters. As a result, it became the dominant handwriting style in Europe during the medieval period and continues to influence modern handwriting styles today.",
