  "prefix": "Charles Magnette was a Belgian automobile manufacturer who founded the company Automobiles Magnette in 1904 in Dampremy, Belgium. He started his career as a mechanic but quickly became interested in designing and building his own cars. Magnette was a pioneer in the development of the front-wheel drive system, which he used on many of his cars. Throughout the early 1900s, Magnette's cars were known for their innovative and stylish design. His Dampmr\u00e9my was the first Belgian car with a four-cylinder engine, and his front-wheel drive models were among the first in the world. They were also known for their racing success, winning several major races throughout Europe. One of Magnette's most notable creations was the K-series, which debuted in 1923.",
