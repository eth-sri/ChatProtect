  "prefix": "Idle Warship is a musical group consisting of American hip hop artists, Talib Kweli and Res. The group was formed in 2004, with the intent of exploring a mix of hip hop, rock, soul, funk, and electronic music. The name Idel Warship was inspired by Kweli's desire to create a musical \"vessel\" that would provide an outlet for his eclectic musical ideas, as well as his frustrations with the current state of the music industry. The band released their debut album, \"Habits of the Heart,\" in 2011 on the Blacksmith Music label. The album featured collaborations with several guest artists, including John Forte, Jean Grae, and Michelle Williams. \"Habits of the Heart\" received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the group's musical experimentation and socially conscious lyrics.",
