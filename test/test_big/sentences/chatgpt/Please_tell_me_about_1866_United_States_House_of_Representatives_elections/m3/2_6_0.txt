  "prefix": "The 1866 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 6, 1866, in the middle of Republican President Andrew Johnson's term. The elections were important because they were the first congressional elections held after the end of the American Civil War and Reconstruction had begun. The Republican Party won a resounding victory in these elections, gaining a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. They ran on a platform of promoting Reconstruction policies that would grant freedom and civil rights to African Americans, in contrast to the policies of President Johnson, who was seen as soft on the Southern states. The elections saw a sharp division between the North and South, with Republicans winning the majority of seats in the North and the Democrats hanging on to their traditional stronghold in the South. Voter turnout was low overall, as many voters were still recovering from the effects of the war and were uncertain about the future.",
