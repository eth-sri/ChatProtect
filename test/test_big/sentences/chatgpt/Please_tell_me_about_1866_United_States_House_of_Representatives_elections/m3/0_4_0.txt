The Republican Party had won a majority in the 1864 elections and held on to it in 1866. The main issues of the 1866 election were the Reconstruction policies of President Johnson and the Republican Party's plans for the future of the South following the Civil War. The Republicans supported the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 which aimed to reform the former Confederate states and ensure the rights of newly-emancipated African Americans.",
