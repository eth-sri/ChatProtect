  "alt": "The continuing dominance of the Republican Party in Congress was reflected in the subsequent elections of 1868, where they won the presidency and maintained their majority in both the House and Senate.",
  "prefix": "The 1866 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 6, 1866. These elections were held in the middle of Andrew Johnson's presidency, during the period of Reconstruction following the Civil War. In these elections, all 193 seats in the House of Representatives were up for grabs. The Republican Party retained a commanding majority in the House, winning 136 seats, while the Democrats won 37 seats. The remaining 20 seats were won by various third-party candidates. These elections marked the first time that African Americans were elected to the House of Representatives, with three black Republicans winning seats from southern states \u2013 Joseph Rainey from South Carolina, Robert De Large from South Carolina, and Benjamin Turner from Alabama. The Republican victory in these elections allowed for the passage of several important legislative measures, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to all persons born in the United States, and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which similarly guaranteed equal protection and due process of law to all citizens.",
