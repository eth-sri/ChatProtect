  "prefix": "The 1866 United States House of Representatives elections were held in the middle of President Andrew Johnson's term, after the end of the Civil War. The Republican Party had won a majority in the 1864 elections and held on to it in 1866. The main issues of the 1866 election were the Reconstruction policies of President Johnson and the Republican Party's plans for the future of the South following the Civil War. The Republicans supported the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 which aimed to reform the former Confederate states and ensure the rights of newly-emancipated African Americans. Despite opposition from Johnson, the Republicans maintained their majority in the House of Representatives, gaining nine seats and holding a 144-42 advantage over the Democrats in the 40th Congress. The election was seen as a victory for Radical Republicans who supported civil rights for African Americans and harsh punishment for former Confederate leaders.",
