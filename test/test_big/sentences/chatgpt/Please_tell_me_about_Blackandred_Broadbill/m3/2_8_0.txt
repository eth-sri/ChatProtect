This species typically measures around 17 cm in length and weighs around 33 g.\n\nThe Black-and-red Broadbill is recognized by its glossy black upperparts and bright red underparts. It has a short blue or turquoise bill and a small white patch on its forehead. The wings are blue-green in color and show black markings on the primaries, whereas the tail is black with a broad white tip. These birds inhabit dense forests, especially in the lowland areas, and seem to prefer humid and shaded environments. They feed on small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and mollusks, but they also consume some fruits and seeds. Black-and-red Broadbills are usually seen in pairs or small groups, and they are known to sing duets.",
