  "prefix": "Fidel Castro was a revolutionary leader and politician who ruled Cuba as Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President from 1976 to 2008. He was born on August 13, 1926, in Biran, Cuba, and died on November 25, 2016, in Havana, Cuba. Castro led the Cuban Revolution that overthrew the US-backed Batista government in 1959 and established a socialist state in Cuba, which became a significant ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. During his years in power, Castro implemented various socialist policies, including the nationalization of industries and land, free education and healthcare, and the suppression of political opposition and dissent. Under his leadership, Cuba became one of the most highly educated and literate countries in the developing world, providing universal healthcare, free education, and a robust social safety net for its citizens. However, Cuba also suffered from economic hardships, political repression, and human rights violations.",
