Castro was born in 1926 in Bir\u00e1n, Cuba, and he was educated in Catholic schools. Castro gained international attention when he led a successful guerrilla war against the Cuban government in 1959. He established a socialist government in Cuba and aligned the country with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He became a symbol of anti-Americanism in Latin America and around the world. Under Castro's regime, Cuba became a one-party state and many political freedoms were curtailed. Critics of the regime were frequently arrested and imprisoned, and the country's economy suffered due to international trade sanctions.",
