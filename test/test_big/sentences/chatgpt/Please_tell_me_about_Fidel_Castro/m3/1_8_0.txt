  "prefix": "Fidel Castro was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and then as the President of the Council of State and the President of the Council of Ministers from 1976 to 2008. Castro was born in 1926 in Bir\u00e1n, Cuba, and he was educated in Catholic schools. Castro gained international attention when he led a successful guerrilla war against the Cuban government in 1959. He established a socialist government in Cuba and aligned the country with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He became a symbol of anti-Americanism in Latin America and around the world. Under Castro's regime, Cuba became a one-party state and many political freedoms were curtailed. Critics of the regime were frequently arrested and imprisoned, and the country's economy suffered due to international trade sanctions. However, Cuba also made significant achievements in education and healthcare under Castro's leadership.",
