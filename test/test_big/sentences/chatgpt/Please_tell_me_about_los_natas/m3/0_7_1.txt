The band originally consisted of guitarist and vocalist Sergio Chotsourian, drummer Walter Broide, and bassist Gonzalo Villagra. They were known for their heavy, riff-driven sound, often incorporating elements of stoner rock, doom metal, and space rock into their music. Over the years, Los Natas released several albums, including \"Delmar\" (1998), \"Corsario Negro\" (2002), and \"Nuevo Orden de la Libertad\" (2009). The band also gained a reputation for their intense and unpredictable live performances. In addition to their work with Los Natas, the members of the band also collaborated with other musicians and formed side projects. Sergio Chotsourian went on to form the band Ararat, while Gonzalo Villagra formed Los Humanoides.",
