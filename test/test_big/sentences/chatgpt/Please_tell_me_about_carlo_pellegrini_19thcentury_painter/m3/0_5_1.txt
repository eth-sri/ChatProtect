Pellegrini is best known for his genre scenes and landscapes, which often feature everyday life in rural Italy. He was also a skilled portrait painter and painted many prominent people of his time, including members of the royal family. In 1876 Pellegrini was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy for his services to art, and he was well regarded during his lifetime.",
