  "prefix": "Follower is a position in Australian rules football that is also known as a ruckman or ruck rover. The player in this position is typically positioned in the centre of the ground, and their primary role is to contest the rucking duels at stoppages and clear the ball to their team's advantage. Followers are usually tall and have a good jumping ability, as well as strong marking skills. They are responsible for out-jumping the opposition ruckman and either tapping the ball to their own advantage or directing it to a teammate.",
