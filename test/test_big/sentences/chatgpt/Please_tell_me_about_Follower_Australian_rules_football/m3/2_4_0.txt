  "prefix": "Follower is a position in Australian Rules football that is responsible for playing in the midfield, often around the centre of the ground. The primary role of a follower is to win possession of the ball at stoppages such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups, and then distribute the ball to teammates with effective handball or kick. A follower's second role is to provide support and protection to teammates when required. Follower is a highly demanding position where a player needs to be physically fit, have exceptional control over the ball, and the ability to read the play and make quick decisions.",
