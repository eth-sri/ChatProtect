  "prefix": "Follower is a position in Australian Rules football that is responsible for playing in the midfield, often around the centre of the ground. The primary role of a follower is to win possession of the ball at stoppages such as boundary throw-ins and ball-ups, and then distribute the ball to teammates with effective handball or kick. A follower's second role is to provide support and protection to teammates when required. Follower is a highly demanding position where a player needs to be physically fit, have exceptional control over the ball, and the ability to read the play and make quick decisions. Followers are often among the fittest players in an Australian Rules football team. They are frequently required to run long distances during games and need to have strong endurance to keep up with the speed and intensity of the game.",
