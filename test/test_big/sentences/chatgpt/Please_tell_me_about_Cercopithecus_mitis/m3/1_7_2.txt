  "prefix": "Cercopithecus mitis is a species of Old World monkey found in East Africa. The common name for this monkey is the blue monkey, owing to the bluish-grey fur on their back and limbs. They have a white throat and chest, black face, and a tail with a tuft of white hair on the end. Blue monkeys live in large social groups of up to 40 individuals and use a complex vocal system to communicate with each other. They are primarily arboreal and feed on a variety of fruits, leaves, and insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal and are preyed upon by leopards, eagles, and pythons. The conservation status of blue monkeys is of least concern, although they are threatened by habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat.",
