  "prefix": "Cercopithecus mitis is a species of Old World monkey found in East Africa. The common name for this monkey is the blue monkey, owing to the bluish-grey fur on their back and limbs. They have a white throat and chest, black face, and a tail with a tuft of white hair on the end. Blue monkeys live in large social groups of up to 40 individuals and use a complex vocal system to communicate with each other. They are primarily arboreal and feed on a variety of fruits, leaves, and insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal and are preyed upon by leopards, eagles, and pythons.",
