  "prefix": "Cercopithecus mitis is more commonly known as the blue monkey or diademed monkey. It is a species of Old World monkey that is found in several countries of eastern and southern Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Blue monkeys are medium-sized primates, with males typically weighing between 4-8 kg and females weighing between 3-6 kg. They have a distinctive bluish-grey coat, with a dark face and white throat and chest. They are diurnal, arboreal, and highly social, typically living in groups of up to 40 individuals. Blue monkeys are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of foods including fruit, leaves, flowers, and insects. They are an important prey item for larger predators, such as leopards and eagles. Cercopithecus mitis are not considered to be endangered, but they are vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and human activities.",
