  "prefix": "Cercopithecus mitis, also known as the blue monkey, is a species of Old World monkey found in the forests of Central and East Africa. They have a distinctive bluish-grey coat with a white belly, and their eyes are surrounded by a black patch of fur. They have a long, slender tail, which they use for balance while moving through the trees. Blue monkeys are social animals that live in groups. These groups typically consist of a dominant male and several females and their offspring. They communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, flowers, and insects. They play an important role in the forest ecosystem by dispersing seeds in their feces.",
