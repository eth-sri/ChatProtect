Fran\u00e7ois-Marie-Benjamin Richard was a French mathematician and engineer who was born on December 12, 1819, in Paris, France. He is best known for his mathematical work in the field of topology. Richard worked on the construction of the Paris-Lyon-Marseille railway line. He became a professor at the \u00c9cole de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris. Richard made significant contributions to the study of topology, particularly in the area of knot theory. He studied the properties of closed curves in three-dimensional space and developed a new method for classifying knots. His work on knot theory has had important applications in fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology. In addition to his work in mathematics, Richard was also a talented artist and musician.",
