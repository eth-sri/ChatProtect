He is best known for his mathematical work in the field of topology, which is the study of geometrical properties that remain unchanged when a figure is stretched or deformed. Richard began his career as an engineer and worked on several important projects, including the construction of the Paris-Lyon-Marseille railway line. He later turned his attention to mathematics and became a professor at the \u00c9cole de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris. Richard made significant contributions to the study of topology, particularly in the area of knot theory.",
