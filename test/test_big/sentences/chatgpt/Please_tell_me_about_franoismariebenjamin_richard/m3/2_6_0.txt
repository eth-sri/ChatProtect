  "prefix": "Fran\u00e7ois-Marie-Benjamin Richard was a French mathematician and engineer who was born on December 12, 1819, in Paris, France. He is best known for his mathematical work in the field of topology, which is the study of geometrical properties that remain unchanged when a figure is stretched or deformed. Richard began his career as an engineer and worked on several important projects, including the construction of the Paris-Lyon-Marseille railway line. He later turned his attention to mathematics and became a professor at the \u00c9cole de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris. Richard made significant contributions to the study of topology, particularly in the area of knot theory. He studied the properties of closed curves in three-dimensional space and developed a new method for classifying knots.",
