The eyes are ringed with a white ring. They are found in a variety of habitats, such as forests, plantations, and gardens. They are also commonly seen in urban areas, where they thrive on nectar from flowering plants and fruits. Grey Breasted Whiteeyes are social birds that live in groups. They are highly active and constantly on the move, flitting around in search of insects and nectar. They have a sharp and melodious call, which they use to communicate with each other. Grey Breasted Whiteeyes breed throughout the year and build their nests in thick vegetation. The female lays 2-3 eggs, which are incubated by both parents. The young birds fledge after two weeks and are cared for by the parents until they are fully independent.",
