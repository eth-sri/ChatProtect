  "prefix": "The Grey-breasted White-eye is a small passerine bird species found in Southeast Asia. Adult birds have a distinctive grey head, breast, and upperparts with a yellow-green belly and undertail coverts. The wings and tail are dark brown, and the legs and bill are black. The eyes are also surrounded by a distinctive white eye-ring, which gives the bird its name. These birds primarily feed on fruit, nectar, and insects and can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, mangroves, plantations, and gardens. They are typically found in pairs or small flocks and are known for their agile and acrobatic movements as they feed. In terms of breeding, Grey-breasted White-eyes typically build a cup-shaped nest made of twigs, grass, and leaves, which is usually placed in the fork of a tree or a shrub. The female lays 2-3 eggs, which are incubated for around 13-14 days before hatching. Although the population size of these birds is currently stable, habitat loss and disturbance due to human activities are a threat to their survival.",
