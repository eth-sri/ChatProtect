  "prefix": "Samsung Behold II (SGH-t939) is a former Android-based smartphone manufactured by Samsung. The device was released November 2009 and features a 3.2-inch AMOLED touch screen display, 5MP camera, and 8GB of internal storage (expandable up to 32GB via microSD). It runs on an older version of Android, 1.6 (Donut) that has been customized with Samsung's TouchWiz user interface. The device also features Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The battery has a capacity of 1500 mAh which provides up to 6 hours of talk time and up to 12 days of standby time. However, due to its outdated Android operating system, the device does not support many modern apps and functions and is no longer supported by Samsung. It also has limited support for multitasking, which can make it frustrating to use for those who like to run multiple apps at once.",
