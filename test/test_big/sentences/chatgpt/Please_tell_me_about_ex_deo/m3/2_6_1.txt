The band was formed in 2008 and is focussed on the themes of the Roman Empire, its history and mythology. The name \"Ex Deo\" translates to \"From God\" which was a Latin inscription that was used during the Roman Empire to dedicate battles and victories to the gods. Ex Deo's music blends the elements of death metal, epic and symphonic music along with the classical instruments that are associated with the Roman Empire, to create a unique and powerful sound. The band has released four studio albums so far, namely \"Romulus\" (2009), \"Caligvla\" (2012), \"The Immortal Wars\" (2017) and \"The Thirteen Years of Nero\" (2021).
