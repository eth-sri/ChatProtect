  "orig": "This makes CA-1 an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer drugs, as it provides a unique mechanism of action that is distinct from conventional chemotherapeutics.",
  "alt": "It provides a promising avenue for the development of new cancer therapies.",
  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 (CA-1) is a natural product originally isolated from the African willow tree Combretum caffrum. It belongs to a family of small molecules called combretastatins that have been found to possess potent anti-cancer activity by destroying the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, a process known as vascular disruption. CA-1 has been shown to selectively target and destroy the fragile endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in tumors, leading to a rapid collapse of the tumor vasculature and subsequent tumor cell death.",
