  "alt": "Combretastatin A-1 can induce tumor cell death by disrupting the microtubule network in cancer cells.",
  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 is a microtubule-binding agent that has shown promising results in cancer research. It is a natural compound extracted from the bark of the African tree Combretum caffrum, and its anti-tumor activity is thought to be a result of its ability to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) in tumors.",
