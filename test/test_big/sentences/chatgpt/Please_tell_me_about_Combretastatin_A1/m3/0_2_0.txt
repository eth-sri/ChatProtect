  "target": "Please tell me about Combretastatin A-1",
  "orig": "CA-1 has been shown to selectively target and destroy the fragile endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in tumors, leading to a rapid collapse of the tumor vasculature and subsequent tumor cell death.",
  "alt": "CA-1 has been shown to bind to tubulin, a protein that makes up the cytoskeleton of cells, and disrupt the formation of microtubules, causing the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels to collapse and die, ultimately leading to tumor starvation and death.",
  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 (CA-1) is a natural product originally isolated from the African willow tree Combretum caffrum. It belongs to a family of small molecules called combretastatins that have been found to possess potent anti-cancer activity by destroying the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, a process known as vascular disruption.",
