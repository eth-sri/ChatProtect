  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 (CA-1) is a natural product originally isolated from the African willow tree Combretum caffrum. It belongs to a family of small molecules called combretastatins that have been found to possess potent anti-cancer activity by destroying the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, a process known as vascular disruption. CA-1 has been shown to selectively target and destroy the fragile endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in tumors, leading to a rapid collapse of the tumor vasculature and subsequent tumor cell death. This makes CA-1 an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer drugs, as it provides a unique mechanism of action that is distinct from conventional chemotherapeutics. Clinical trials of CA-1 and related compounds are ongoing, with promising results in the treatment of various solid tumors, including melanoma, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.",
