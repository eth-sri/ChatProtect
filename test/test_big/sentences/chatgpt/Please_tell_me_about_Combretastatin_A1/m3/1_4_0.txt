  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 is a microtubule-binding agent that has shown promising results in cancer research. It is a natural compound extracted from the bark of the African tree Combretum caffrum, and its anti-tumor activity is thought to be a result of its ability to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) in tumors. Studies have shown that Combretastatin A-1 can induce the rapid collapse of tumor blood vessels and subsequently cause tumor cell death due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. This makes it a potential therapy for solid tumors, such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancer.",
