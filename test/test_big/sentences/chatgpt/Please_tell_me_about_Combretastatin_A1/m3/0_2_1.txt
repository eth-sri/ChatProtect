  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 (CA-1) is a natural product originally isolated from the African willow tree Combretum caffrum. It belongs to a family of small molecules called combretastatins that have been found to possess potent anti-cancer activity by destroying the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, a process known as vascular disruption.",
