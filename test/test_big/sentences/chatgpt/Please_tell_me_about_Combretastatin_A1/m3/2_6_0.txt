  "prefix": "Combretastatin A-1 (CA-1) is a natural compound derived from the bark of the South African tree Combretum caffrum. It belongs to the class of compounds known as stilbenes and has been found to exhibit potent antitumor activity. CA-1 works by disrupting the formation of new blood vessels in tumors, a process known as angiogenesis. It has been shown to bind selectively to the protein tubulin, inhibiting its assembly into microtubules, which are essential for the growth and division of cells. Furthermore, CA-1 has been found to induce apoptosis (cell death) in tumor cells, leading to their destruction. Research on the use of CA-1 in cancer treatment is ongoing, and clinical trials have shown promising results.",
