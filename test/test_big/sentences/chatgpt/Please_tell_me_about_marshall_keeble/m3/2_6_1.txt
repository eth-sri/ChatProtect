He was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and began preaching in the Church of Christ at the age of 17. Keeble became known for his powerful and passionate preaching style, which focused on personal salvation and the importance of living a Christian life. Keeble faced significant challenges as an African American preacher during a time of segregation and discrimination against black people in the United States. Despite these challenges, he traveled extensively throughout the country, preaching at rallies and revivals, and baptizing thousands of people. In addition to his preaching, Keeble was also a mentor to many young preachers, providing them with training and support to help them build successful ministries.",
