  "prefix": "Marshall Keeble (1878-1968) was an influential evangelist and preacher within the Churches of Christ/Christian Churches in the United States during the early-to-mid-20th century. Keeble was known for his charismatic preaching style, and he was one of the few African American preachers to gain widespread acceptance and respect among predominantly white Churches of Christ. Keeble was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and grew up in poverty. After experiencing a religious conversion as a young man, he began preaching in local churches. He eventually became an itinerant evangelist, traveling around the country (and later around the world) to preach and hold gospel meetings. Keeble's preaching style was characterized by his powerful voice, emotional delivery, and use of humor. He was also known for his ability to connect with people from all walks of life, and he attracted diverse crowds to his meetings. Despite facing discrimination and racism, Keeble remained committed to his faith and to his mission of preaching the gospel. He was a key figure in the Churches of Christ and instrumental in the growth of the African American churches within that tradition.",
