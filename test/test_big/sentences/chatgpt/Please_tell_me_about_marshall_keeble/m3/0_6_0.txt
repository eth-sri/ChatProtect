Keeble was known for his charismatic preaching style, and he was one of the few African American preachers to gain widespread acceptance and respect among predominantly white Churches of Christ. Keeble was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and grew up in poverty. After experiencing a religious conversion as a young man, he began preaching in local churches. He eventually became an itinerant evangelist, traveling around the country (and later around the world) to preach and hold gospel meetings. Keeble's preaching style was characterized by his powerful voice, emotional delivery, and use of humor.",
