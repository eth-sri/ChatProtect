  "prefix": "The Battle of Mice is a song by the American post-metal band, Isis. The song was released in 2004 on their album, Panopticon. The song is known for its heavy use of atmospheric and droning soundscapes, and features both clean and harsh vocals. The lyrics of the song are open to interpretation, but many people believe that they are about the human struggle against nature. The title of the song is thought to be a reference to the fable of the lion and the mouse, where a tiny mouse is able to free a lion from a trap. The song is often praised for its unique sound and approach to metal music. Its atmospheric qualities and heavy use of melody set it apart from other metal songs, and it has become a staple in the post-metal genre.",
