  "prefix": "The Battle of Mice is not a historic battle but the name of a band from the United States. They are known as an experimental rock band that was formed in 2006. The band consists of members from various other bands such as Oxbow, Angel Hair, Ghostride, Harkonen, and Made Out Of Babies. The group\u2019s music is characterized by their dark and intense sound, which features noise rock, post-hardcore, and avant-garde elements. Their lyrics are often deeply personal and introspective, addressing themes such as depression, anxiety, and addiction. The Battle of Mice released their debut album, \u201cA Day of Nights\u201d in 2006. The album was well-received by critics and helped to establish the band as a prominent figure in the experimental rock scene. However, despite their success, the band only released one additional album, \u201cTriptych\u201d in 2007, before disbanding.",
