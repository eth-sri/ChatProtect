  "prefix": "Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyelids and eyebrows. It is characterized by a small eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and a fold of skin from the upper eyelid that covers the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). There are two types of BPES: type I and type II. Type I is primarily characterized by blepharophimosis and ptosis, while type II also includes ovarian dysfunction and infertility in females. BPES is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene on chromosome 3.",
