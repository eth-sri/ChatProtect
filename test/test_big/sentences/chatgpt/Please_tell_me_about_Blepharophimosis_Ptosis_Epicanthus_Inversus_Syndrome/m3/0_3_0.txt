  "prefix": "Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyelids, eyebrows, and other facial features. It is caused by a mutation in the FOXL2 gene on chromosome 3. The main features of BPES include a narrow eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and a fold of skin that extends from the upper eyelid down to the nose (epicanthus inversus).",
