  "prefix": "Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyelids, eyebrows, and other facial features. It is caused by a mutation in the FOXL2 gene on chromosome 3. The main features of BPES include a narrow eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and a fold of skin that extends from the upper eyelid down to the nose (epicanthus inversus). This combination of features can make the eyes appear smaller than normal, and can affect both eyes or just one eye. In addition to these facial features, BPES can also cause other health problems in some individuals, including infertility and early menopause in women with the disorder.",
