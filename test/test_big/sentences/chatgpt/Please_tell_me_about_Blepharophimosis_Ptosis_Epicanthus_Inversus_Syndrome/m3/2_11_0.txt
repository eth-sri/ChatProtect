  "prefix": "Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyelids. The syndrome is characterized by the following features:\n\n1. Blepharophimosis: This refers to the narrowing of the eye opening caused by a shortening of the distance between the inner and outer corners of the eyes. This gives the eyes a \"slit-like\" appearance. 2. Ptosis: This refers to drooping of the upper eyelids, which may affect one or both eyes. 3. Epicanthus Inversus: This refers to a fold of skin that runs from the upper eyelid to the lower eyelid inside the corner of the eye, giving the appearance of a \"reverse\" epicanthus. BPES is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene on chromosome 3. The FOXL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of the eyelids and ovaries. There are two types of BPES: type 1 and type 2.",
