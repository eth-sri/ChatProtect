  "prefix": "Dryandra longifolia is a species of shrub or small tree in the family Proteaceae, native to southwest Western Australia. It is commonly known as the Long-leafed Dryandra or Tall Dryandra. It can grow up to 15 meters in height and has serrated leaves that range from 12 to 36 cm in length and 1.5 to 6 cm in width. The flowers are yellow and occur mainly in autumn. Dryandra longifolia is a significant component of the Kwongan heathlands and woodlands, and it provides habitat for a wide range of birds, insects, and mammals. It is also used as a street tree in some Australian cities due to its attractive appearance and tolerance of urban conditions. In recent years, some populations of Dryandra longifolia have been threatened by habitat destruction, and the species is listed as \"endangered\" under Western Australian legislation.",
