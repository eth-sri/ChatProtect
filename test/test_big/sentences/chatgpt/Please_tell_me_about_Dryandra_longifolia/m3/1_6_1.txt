It is commonly known as the \"dryandra\" or the \"long-leaf dryandra.\" The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall with long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The flowers are yellow and spike-like in shape and bloom from August to November. It is an important species for conservation as it is severely threatened by habitat loss, particularly due to clearing of land for agriculture and development. Despite its vulnerability, it is often used as an ornamental shrub due to its attractive flowers and foliage.",
