The flowers are yellow and occur mainly in autumn. Dryandra longifolia is a significant component of the Kwongan heathlands and woodlands, and it provides habitat for a wide range of birds, insects, and mammals. It is also used as a street tree in some Australian cities due to its attractive appearance and tolerance of urban conditions.",
