It was intended to serve as a high-speed, low-altitude strike aircraft and was designed to be capable of delivering a variety of munitions, including bombs, rockets, and torpedoes. The P.188 was powered by four BMW 003A turbojet engines, which provided a top speed of around 533 mph (856 km/h) at sea level. It had a wingspan of 82 ft 8 in (25.2 m) and a length of 62 ft 5 in (19.0 m). The aircraft's armament consisted of four 30mm MK 108 cannon and a bomb load of up to 4,409 lb (2,000 kg). The P.188 was designed to operate at low altitudes, which made it difficult for enemy fighters to intercept.",
