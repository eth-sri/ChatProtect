  "prefix": "The Blohm & Voss P.188 was a German jet-powered reconnaissance aircraft designed in World War II. It was designed to replace the aging Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and was intended to be a high-altitude aircraft capable of speeds of over 600 mph. The P.188 had a relatively conventional design for a jet-powered aircraft, with a twin-boom layout, a swept-back wing, and a T-tail. It was powered by two Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet engines mounted in the fuselage. The P.188's primary mission was to conduct long-range reconnaissance flights over the Atlantic Ocean to detect and track Allied shipping.",
