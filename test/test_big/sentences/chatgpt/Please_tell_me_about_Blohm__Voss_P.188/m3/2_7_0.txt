  "orig": "By the time the design was completed in 1945, the war was coming to an end, and the need for a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft had diminished.",
  "alt": "By the time the P.188 was developed, the need for a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft had diminished due to the increasing effectiveness of radar and other detection technologies.",
  "prefix": "The Blohm & Voss P.188 was a German jet-powered reconnaissance aircraft designed in World War II. It was designed to replace the aging Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and was intended to be a high-altitude aircraft capable of speeds of over 600 mph. The P.188 had a relatively conventional design for a jet-powered aircraft, with a twin-boom layout, a swept-back wing, and a T-tail. It was powered by two Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet engines mounted in the fuselage. The P.188's primary mission was to conduct long-range reconnaissance flights over the Atlantic Ocean to detect and track Allied shipping. To accomplish this, it was equipped with a variety of cameras and other sensors, including infrared and radar systems. Despite its advanced design, the P.188 never entered production.",
