  "prefix": "The Blohm & Voss P.188 was a projected German high altitude reconnaissance plane during World War II. It was intended to fly deep into enemy territory to gather intelligence data, and was designed to reach altitudes exceeding 18,000 meters (59,000 feet). The P.188 was a large aircraft, with a wingspan of over 44 meters (144 feet) and a length of over 23 meters (75 feet). It was to be powered by four powerful turbojet engines, which would have allowed it to reach speeds of up to 870 km/h (540 mph). The aircraft was designed with a pressurized cockpit and advanced radar and camera equipment. It was to have a crew of two and was armed with a pair of machine guns in a dorsal turret. However, the P.188 never went beyond the design stage, as the war ended before it could be built.",
