  "prefix": "The Blohm & Voss P.188 was a German jet-powered tactical bomber aircraft designed during World War II. It was intended to serve as a high-speed, low-altitude strike aircraft and was designed to be capable of delivering a variety of munitions, including bombs, rockets, and torpedoes. The P.188 was powered by four BMW 003A turbojet engines, which provided a top speed of around 533 mph (856 km/h) at sea level. It had a wingspan of 82 ft 8 in (25.2 m) and a length of 62 ft 5 in (19.0 m). The aircraft's armament consisted of four 30mm MK 108 cannon and a bomb load of up to 4,409 lb (2,000 kg). The P.188 was designed to operate at low altitudes, which made it difficult for enemy fighters to intercept. It was also equipped with advanced navigational equipment, including radar and a ground mapping system, which made it capable of operating in any weather conditions. Despite its advanced design, the P.188 never entered full production due to the end of the war.",
