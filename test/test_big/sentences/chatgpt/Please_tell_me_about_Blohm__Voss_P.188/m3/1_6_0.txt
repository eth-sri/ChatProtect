It was intended to fly deep into enemy territory to gather intelligence data, and was designed to reach altitudes exceeding 18,000 meters (59,000 feet). The P.188 was a large aircraft, with a wingspan of over 44 meters (144 feet) and a length of over 23 meters (75 feet). It was to be powered by four powerful turbojet engines, which would have allowed it to reach speeds of up to 870 km/h (540 mph). The aircraft was designed with a pressurized cockpit and advanced radar and camera equipment. It was to have a crew of two and was armed with a pair of machine guns in a dorsal turret.",
