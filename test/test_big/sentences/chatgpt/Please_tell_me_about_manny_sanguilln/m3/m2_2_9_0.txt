He was born on March 21, 1944, in Col\u00f3n, Panama. He was known for his exceptional defensive skills as a catcher, and was also a solid hitter with a career batting average of .296. Sanguill\u00e9n made his MLB debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1967, and quickly established himself as one of the best catchers in the National League. He was a key player on the Pirates teams of the 1970s that won two World Series titles in 1971 and 1979. He earned six All-Star selections during his career. Sanguill\u00e9n had a unique way of catching, which involved him crouching very low and catching pitches with his bare hand. He was also known for his speed on the bases, and would occasionally steal bases when the opportunity presented itself. After retiring from playing baseball, Sanguill\u00e9n stayed involved in the sport by coaching and mentoring young players.",
