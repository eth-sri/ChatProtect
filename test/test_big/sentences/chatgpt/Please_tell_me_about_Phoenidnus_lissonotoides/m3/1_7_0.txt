  "prefix": "Phoenidnus lissonotoides is a species of large beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It is known as the white-spotted sawyer or the Asian long-horned beetle. This beetle is native to China, Korea, and Japan, but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe. The white-spotted sawyer beetle can grow up to 3.5 centimeters in length and has a black body with white spots. The larvae of this beetle feed on the bark and wood of trees, and can cause damage that can lead to tree death. As an invasive species, the white-spotted sawyer beetle is considered a serious threat to forests and urban trees. Efforts are being made to control the population of this invasive species, and one of the methods used is the removal and destruction of infected trees.",
