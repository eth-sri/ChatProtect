  "prefix": "Phoenix lissonotoides, also known as the Canary Island Date Palm, is a palm species native to the Canary Islands and Morocco. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its elegant, feathery fronds and attractive trunk. This palm tree has a tall, slender trunk that grows up to 20 meters in height with a diameter of up to 60 cm. This trunk is topped by a crown of large, arching leaves that grow up to 6 meters long. The leaves are a dark green color and have a distinctive V-shaped pattern. The Phoenix lissonotoides is a slow-growing species that can take several years to reach its full height. It prefers soil that is well-drained, sandy, and has good drainage. It can tolerate some shade but thrives in full sun. The plant requires regular watering but can tolerate drought conditions once established. The palm produces small, yellow flowers in clusters that grow near the base of the leaves. These flowers are followed by dark brown, oval-shaped, edible fruit that is about 1 to 1.5 cm in length. The Phoenix lissonotoides is a popular palm species in landscaping design. Its unique silhouette and attractive foliage make it a favorite tree for many homeowners and landscapers.",
