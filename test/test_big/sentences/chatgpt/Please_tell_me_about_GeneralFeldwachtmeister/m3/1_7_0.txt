The rank was typically held by a senior non-commissioned officer who served as a deputy to a higher-ranking officer. In Austria, the General-Feldwachtmeister was a rank in the cavalry and was roughly equivalent to a sergeant major. In the German Army, the rank was used in the artillery and engineering corps and was also equivalent to a sergeant major. The General-Feldwachtmeister was responsible for a variety of duties, including training and discipline of the troops, maintaining order and security within military camps, and acting as a liaison between the officers and the enlisted men. They were also responsible for supervising the execution of orders and the handling of supplies. During wartime, the General-Feldwachtmeister would often serve as a battlefield commander, leading troops into battle in the absence of a commissioned officer.",
