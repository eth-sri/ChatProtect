  "prefix": "General-Feldwachtmeister is a German term that roughly translates to \"General Field Sergeant Major\" in English. It is a military rank used by several branches of the German military, including the army and air force. In the German army, the rank of General-Feldwachtmeister is equivalent to the NATO rank code OR-9, which is the highest non-commissioned officer rank. This rank is typically held by an experienced senior NCO who has demonstrated exceptional leadership and tactical skills. It is also worth noting that the rank of General-Feldwachtmeister is not commonly used in modern German military structures. Instead, the highest non-commissioned officer rank in use today is Oberstabsfeldwebel.",
