He was held captive for seven years and was sexually abused by Parnell during that time. In 1980, when Steven was 14 years old, Parnell abducted another boy, Timmy White, and this prompted Steven to flee with Timmy and seek help from the police. This act of courage led to Parnell's arrest and Steven's reunion with his family.",
