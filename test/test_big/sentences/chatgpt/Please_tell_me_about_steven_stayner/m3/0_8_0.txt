  "prefix": "Steven Stayner was an American child abduction victim who was abducted when he was seven years old while on his way to school in 1972 in Merced, California, by Kenneth Parnell, a convicted child molester. Parnell held Steven captive and sexually abused him for seven years. In 1980, when Steven was 14 years old, he was able to escape with another young boy who Parnell had also abducted. Steven sought help from a nearby police station and was reunited with his family. After his return, Steven became a national hero and an inspiration for kidnapping victims. He received numerous awards and recognition for his bravery and resilience. He wrote a book about his experiences called \"When Someone Loves You\" which became a national bestseller. However, Steven's life was deeply affected by his abduction and he struggled with the trauma and emotional scars for the rest of his life.",
