Steven sought help from a nearby police station and was reunited with his family. After his return, Steven became a national hero and an inspiration for kidnapping victims. He received numerous awards and recognition for his bravery and resilience. He wrote a book about his experiences called \"When Someone Loves You\" which became a national bestseller.",
