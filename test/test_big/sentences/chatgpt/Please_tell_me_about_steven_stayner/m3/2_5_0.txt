In 1972, Steven was walking home from school in Merced, California when he was approached by Kenneth Parnell, who convinced him to get into his car. Parnell took Steven to a remote cabin where he lived with another boy who he had also abducted. Parnell convinced Steven that his parents no longer wanted him and that he had legal custody of him. Steven was forced to take on a new identity and attend school under a different name.",
