Parnell held Steven captive and sexually abused him for seven years. In 1980, when Steven was 14 years old, he was able to escape with another young boy who Parnell had also abducted. Steven sought help from a nearby police station and was reunited with his family. After his return, Steven became a national hero and an inspiration for kidnapping victims. He received numerous awards and recognition for his bravery and resilience. He wrote a book about his experiences called \"When Someone Loves You\" which became a national bestseller.",
