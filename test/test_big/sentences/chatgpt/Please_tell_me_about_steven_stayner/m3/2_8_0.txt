  "prefix": "Steven Stayner (April 18, 1965 \u2013 September 16, 1989) was an American child abduction victim who was kidnapped at the age of 7 and held captive by his abductor for seven years before managing to escape. In 1972, Steven was walking home from school in Merced, California when he was approached by Kenneth Parnell, who convinced him to get into his car. Parnell took Steven to a remote cabin where he lived with another boy who he had also abducted. Parnell convinced Steven that his parents no longer wanted him and that he had legal custody of him. Steven was forced to take on a new identity and attend school under a different name. He endured years of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of Parnell. In 1980, Parnell abducted another young boy, Timothy White, and Steven worked hard to protect him and convince Parnell to let the two boys go. After a year of trying to escape and finally succeeding, Steven and Timothy went to a police station and reported their abduction.",
