  "alt": "It shouldn't be confused with adenomyosis, which is a similar condition where the endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.",
  "prefix": "Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or other organs in the pelvic area. This tissue is called endometrial tissue. The main symptom of endometriosis is debilitating menstrual cramps, which can occur during or after periods, as well as chronic pelvic pain, painful intercourse, and irregular periods. Infertility and bowel and bladder problems can also be associated with endometriosis. The cause of endometriosis is not known.",
