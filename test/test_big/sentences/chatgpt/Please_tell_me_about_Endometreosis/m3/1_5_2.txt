This tissue is called endometrial tissue. The main symptom of endometriosis is debilitating menstrual cramps, which can occur during or after periods, as well as chronic pelvic pain, painful intercourse, and irregular periods. Infertility and bowel and bladder problems can also be associated with endometriosis. The cause of endometriosis is not known.",
