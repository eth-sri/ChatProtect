  "prefix": "Dickie Moore (born January 6, 1931) was a Canadian ice hockey player who played for the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs in the National Hockey League (NHL) during the 1950s and 1960s. He played left wing and was known for his combination of speed and skill on the ice. Moore was born in Montreal, Quebec and started his career with the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the Quebec Junior Hockey League. He was then signed by the Montreal Canadiens in 1951 and quickly became a star player, winning the Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie in his first season. Moore played 12 seasons with the Canadiens, winning six Stanley Cup championships and becoming one of the most prolific scorers in the NHL during the 1950s. He was named to the NHL All-Star team seven times and won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer twice. In 1963, Moore was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he played for two seasons before retiring from professional hockey in 1967. He finished his career with 608 points in 719 games played in the NHL. After his playing career was over, Moore went on to work as a scout and executive in the NHL, as well as a television commentator. He was also actively involved in charity work, including founding the Dickie Moore Foundation, which supports children and families in need. Moore passed away on December 19, 2015, at the age of 84.",
