  "prefix": "Thomas Chapais (1858-1946) was a Canadian historian, lawyer, and politician from Quebec. He was born in Quebec City and earned a law degree from Laval University in 1879. Chapais practiced law for many years, but his real passion was history. He became a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1889 and was appointed to the federal government's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada in 1919. Chapais authored many books and articles on Canadian history, particularly on the history of Quebec. He is best known for his three-volume work titled \"Cours d'histoire du Canada\" (History of Canada), which was published between 1919 and 1930 and is still considered a classic in Canadian historical scholarship. Chapais was also a professor of history at Laval University and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Montreal in 1919. In addition to his academic work, Chapais also served in politics. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in 1890 as a member of the Conservative Party and served as Minister of Agriculture from 1896 to 1897.",
