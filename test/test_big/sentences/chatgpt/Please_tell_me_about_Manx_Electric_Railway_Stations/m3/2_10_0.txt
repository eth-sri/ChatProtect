The railway has several stations along the way, each with its own unique history and importance. These stations include:\n\n1. Douglas Station: The starting point for the railway, this station is located in the center of Douglas and is the largest station on the line. It features a museum, gift shop, and ticketing facilities. 2. Derby Castle Station: Located at the end of the Douglas promenade, this station was originally built as a terminus for the horse-drawn tramway in 1876.
