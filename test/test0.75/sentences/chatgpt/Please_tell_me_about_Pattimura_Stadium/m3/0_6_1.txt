The stadium was opened in 1986 and has undergone several renovations and upgrades since then, including the installation of floodlights in 2008. It is named after Thomas Matulessy, also known as Pattimura, a national hero from the Maluku Islands who led a rebellion against Dutch colonial rule in the late 18th century. The stadium is home to several local football clubs, including Persiter Ternate, and has hosted several international matches, including the 2007 ASEAN Football Championship. It is also used for other sporting events, such as athletics and martial arts competitions.",

Statement 1 specifically mentions performances by Indonesian musicians, while Statement 2 is more general in its wording. However, both statements support the idea that the stadium has a multi-purpose use beyond just sports."
