  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory as they provide different information about the time period in which Pattimura fought against Dutch colonialism. Statement 1 states that Pattimura fought in the late 18th century, while statement 2 states that he fought in the 19th century. However, both statements agree that the stadium was named after Pattimura, a local or national hero who fought against Dutch colonialism."
