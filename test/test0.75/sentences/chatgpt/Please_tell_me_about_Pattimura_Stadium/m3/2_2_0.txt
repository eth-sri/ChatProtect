  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the stadium has a seating capacity of 10,000 spectators and is primarily used for football matches, while statement 2 says that the stadium has a seating capacity of 25,000 people. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the stadium's seating capacity."
