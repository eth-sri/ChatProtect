  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the stadium is home to several local football clubs, including Persiter Ternate, and has hosted several international matches, including the 2007 ASEAN Football Championship. However, statement 2 contradicts this by stating that the stadium is home to the football club Persiram Raja Ampat. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
