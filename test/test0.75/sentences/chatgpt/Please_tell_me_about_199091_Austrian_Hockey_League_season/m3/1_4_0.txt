  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the playoffs consisted of a traditional bracket format with quarterfinal, semifinal, and final series. However, statement 2 suggests that the playoffs consisted of a round-robin format with three rounds of best-of-five series. These two formats are different, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
