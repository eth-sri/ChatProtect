  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and that the playoffs were played in a best-of-five format. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 mentions the playoffs first and then describes the format, while Statement 2 describes the format first and then mentions the playoffs."
