  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the league consisted of 10 teams and was won by EC VSV Villach, while Statement 2 suggests that the league consisted of only eight teams. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, so they are contradictory."
