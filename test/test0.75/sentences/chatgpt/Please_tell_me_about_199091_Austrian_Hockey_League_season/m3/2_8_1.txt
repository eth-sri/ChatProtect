In the regular season, VEU Feldkirch finished in first place with a record of 23 wins, 13 losses, and 2 ties. EC KAC finished in second place with a record of 22 wins, 13 losses, and 3 ties.

  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Vienna EV's Reinhard Divis was the league's top goaltender, while Statement 2 claims that he posted a league-leading 2.98 goals against average in the regular season. These two statements cannot both be true, as if Divis had the best goals against average in the regular season, he would also have had the best goals against average overall and therefore would not have been surpassed by any other goaltender in the playoffs."
