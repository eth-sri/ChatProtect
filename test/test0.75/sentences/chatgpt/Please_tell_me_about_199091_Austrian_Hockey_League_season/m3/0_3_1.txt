  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the bottom two teams were relegated to the second division, but the first statement adds that the top six teams advanced to the playoffs. This means that the regular season determined which teams would make it to the playoffs and which teams would be relegated, but the playoffs themselves were not mentioned in the second statement. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the regular season and the fate of the bottom two teams."
