  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that EC KAC had 22 wins, 13 losses, and 3 ties, while Statement 2 says that they had 22 wins, 14 losses, and 2 ties. The difference in the number of losses and ties in the two statements makes them contradictory."
