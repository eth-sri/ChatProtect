  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the beginning of the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the season began on September 14, 1990, while statement 2 states that it began on September 21, 1990. These two dates are different, so they cannot both be true."
