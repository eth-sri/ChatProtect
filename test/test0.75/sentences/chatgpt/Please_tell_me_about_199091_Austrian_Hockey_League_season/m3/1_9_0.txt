  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the final series was a best-of-seven between EC VSV Villach and EC KAC Klagenfurt, while Statement 2 claims that the final series was a best-of-five and that EC VSV Villach won the championship by defeating EC KAC Klagenfurt 3-2. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide conflicting information about the format and outcome of the final series."
