  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are not contradictory. Both statements mention that she has released numerous albums that blend different genres of music, including world, Celtic, and electronic. The only difference is that statement 2 also includes Native American music as one of the genres she blends. However, this does not contradict statement 1, as it is simply an additional genre mentioned."
