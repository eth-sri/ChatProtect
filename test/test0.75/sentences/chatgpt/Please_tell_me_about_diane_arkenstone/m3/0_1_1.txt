  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Diane Arkenstone are contradictory. The first statement mentions that she began her music career in the early 1980s as a member of the duo Caravanserai, while the second statement claims that she began her music career in the 1980s as a member of the duo Enaid & Einalem. These two statements cannot both be true, as they refer to different musical groups."
