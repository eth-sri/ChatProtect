  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone's popular albums are contradictory. Statement 1 lists \"The Secret Garden\" as one of her popular albums, while Statement 2 does not. Instead, Statement 2 lists \"The Healing Spirit\" and \"Aquaria,\" which are not mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, the two statements provide different information about Diane Arkenstone's popular albums."
