  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are not contradictory. Both statements mention her Grammy nominations and her collaborations with other musicians, including her ex-husband David Arkenstone. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions Kitaro as another collaborator, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not create a contradiction between the two statements."
