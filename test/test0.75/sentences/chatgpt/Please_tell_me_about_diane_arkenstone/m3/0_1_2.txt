  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are contradictory. Statement 1 states that she began her music career in the early 1980s as a member of the duo Caravanserai, which combined rock, jazz, and world music influences. However, statement 2 contradicts this by stating that her music career in the early 1980s as a member of the duo Caravanserai combined elements of rock and folk music. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they describe different genres of music that Arkenstone was involved in during the same time period."
