  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are not contradictory. Both statements mention her as a musician and composer known for her work in New Age music. The only difference is that the second statement adds that she is also known for her work in the world music genre. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Diane Arkenstone's musical career."
