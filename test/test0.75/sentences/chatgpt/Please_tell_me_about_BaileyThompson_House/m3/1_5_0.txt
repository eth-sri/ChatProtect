  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in the town of Black Mountain, North Carolina. It was built in 1895 by James Bailey, a prominent local businessman, and later purchased by John Thompson, a successful attorney. The house is an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, characterized by its asymmetrical facade, decorative woodwork, and elaborate details. Over the years, the Bailey-Thompson House has been used for various purposes, including as a private residence, a boarding house, and a law office. In 1975, the town of Black Mountain purchased the property and used it as the town hall until 1991.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about the current use of the historic home. Statement 1 mentions that it has served as a museum and cultural center since its use as a town hall ended in 1991, while Statement 2 specifies that it has been a museum since 1994 and focuses on the history and architecture of the Black Mountain area. Both statements are consistent in describing the current use of the Bailey-Thompson House as a museum, but Statement 2 provides more specific information about the museum's focus."
