  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1905 by George W. Saxon, and was later purchased by Walter Bailey and his wife, Margaret. In 1928, the house was sold to Mary and J.T. Thompson, who made significant modifications to the property, including adding a sunroom and a second floor. The Bailey-Thompson House is a two-story, Colonial Revival-style home with a symmetrical facade and a central entrance adorned with a portico. The house features a spacious foyer with a grand staircase, original hardwood floors, and decorative woodwork throughout. The home also has several fireplaces, including one in the living room that is made of Italian marble. In addition to its architectural significance, the Bailey-Thompson House is also notable for its association with several prominent Tallahassee families. The Bailey family was involved in the lumber industry, while the Thompsons were influential in local politics and business. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House is a private residence and is not open to the public.",
