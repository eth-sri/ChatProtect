  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Thompson made modifications to the property, including adding a sunroom and a second floor/balcony. The only difference is in the wording of the second modification (floor vs. balcony), but this does not contradict the first statement."
