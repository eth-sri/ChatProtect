It was built in 1895 by James Bailey, a prominent local businessman, and later purchased by John Thompson, a successful attorney. The house is an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, characterized by its asymmetrical facade, decorative woodwork, and elaborate details. Over the years, the Bailey-Thompson House has been used for various purposes, including as a private residence, a boarding house, and a law office. In 1975, the town of Black Mountain purchased the property and used it as the town hall until 1991.",
