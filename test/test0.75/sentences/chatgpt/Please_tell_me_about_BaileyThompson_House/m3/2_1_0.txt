  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. The first statement states that the house was built in 1905 and later purchased by the Bailey family, while the second statement claims that the house was built in 1885 and later purchased by the Thompson family. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide conflicting information about the origin and ownership of the house."
