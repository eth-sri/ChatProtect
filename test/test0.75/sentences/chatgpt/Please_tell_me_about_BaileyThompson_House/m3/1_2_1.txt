  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Both statements describe the house as an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, characterized by its asymmetrical facade, decorative woodwork, and elaborate details. The only difference is that statement 2 adds the detail of a wrap-around porch, which is not mentioned in statement 1. However, this does not contradict the information provided in statement 1."
