  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he graduated from Boston College with a degree in philosophy and later earned an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, while the second statement mentions that he graduated from Boston University with a degree in economics. These are two different universities and two different fields of study, so they cannot both be true."
