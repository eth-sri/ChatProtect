  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Rawlings earned an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, while Statement 2 says that he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Boston College. An MBA is a graduate-level degree, which means that Rawlings would have already earned a bachelor's degree before pursuing an MBA. Therefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
