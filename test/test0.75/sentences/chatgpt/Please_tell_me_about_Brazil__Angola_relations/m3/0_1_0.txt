Both statements highlight the strong ties between the two countries, with a shared history of Portuguese colonial rule and cultural and linguistic connections. Statement 1 emphasizes the broad range of ties, including economic and political relations, while Statement 2 focuses specifically on the cultural and linguistic connections.
