  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Brazil opened an embassy in Angola in 1980 and Angola reciprocated by opening an embassy in Brazil in 1984. However, statement 2 says that Brazil opened its embassy in Angola in 1976 and Angola reciprocated by opening its embassy in Brazil in 1982. The two statements have different years for the opening of the embassies, which contradicts each other."
