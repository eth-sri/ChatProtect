  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Statement 1 highlights the fact that the two countries have a long-standing relationship in both diplomatic and economic spheres. Statement 2 provides a specific timeline for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Brazil and Angola, which is in line with the broader history of their relationship. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide different perspectives on the topic."
