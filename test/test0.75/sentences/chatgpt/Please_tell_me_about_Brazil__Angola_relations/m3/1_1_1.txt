  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. They both refer to Brazil's recognition of Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, which established the basis for their diplomatic and economic relations. The first statement provides additional context by mentioning the long history of these relations, while the second statement focuses specifically on the recognition of Angola's independence. Together, they provide a more complete picture of the relationship between these two countries."
