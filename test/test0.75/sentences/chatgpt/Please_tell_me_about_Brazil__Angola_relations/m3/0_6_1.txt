Brazil exports a wide range of goods to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and chemicals, while Angola exports primarily oil and diamonds to Brazil. In addition, Brazil has played an important role in Angola's post-civil war reconstruction efforts, providing financial and technical assistance in areas such as agriculture, education, and healthcare. The two countries also have a strong cultural exchange, with Brazil hosting the annual Angola-Brazil Cultural Week and Angola participating in the annual Rio de Janeiro Carnival.",
