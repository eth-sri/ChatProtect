  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long history of diplomatic and economic relations. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil recognized the new government soon after. In 1980, Brazil opened an embassy in Angola, and Angola reciprocated by opening an embassy in Brazil in 1984. The two countries have a significant trade relationship, with Brazil being Angola's largest trading partner. Brazil exports food, machinery, and other goods to Angola, while Angola exports oil and diamonds to Brazil.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight Brazil's investment in Angola's infrastructure, specifically in the construction of roads and ports. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes Brazil's investment in roads and bridges, while statement 1 mentions ports as well. However, both statements support the idea that Brazil has been actively involved in improving Angola's infrastructure."
