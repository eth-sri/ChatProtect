  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long history of diplomatic and economic relations. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil recognized the new government soon after. In 1980, Brazil opened an embassy in Angola, and Angola reciprocated by opening an embassy in Brazil in 1984. The two countries have a significant trade relationship, with Brazil being Angola's largest trading partner. Brazil exports food, machinery, and other goods to Angola, while Angola exports oil and diamonds to Brazil. In recent years, Brazil has also invested in infrastructure projects in Angola, such as building roads and ports. Brazil and Angola have also cooperated in the areas of education and health.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention Brazil providing scholarships for Angolan students to study in Brazilian universities, but the first statement also includes the fact that Brazil has sent medical personnel to Angola to help with public health initiatives. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and provide additional information about the cooperation between Brazil and Angola in the areas of education and health."
