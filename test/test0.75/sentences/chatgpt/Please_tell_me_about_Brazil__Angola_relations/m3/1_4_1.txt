Both statements mention Angola's export of oil to Brazil, which is a significant part of their trade relationship. The first statement also adds that Angola exports diamonds to Brazil, while Brazil exports food, machinery, and other goods to Angola. The second statement focuses solely on Angola's oil exports to Brazil. Overall, both statements provide complementary information about the trade relationship between Brazil and Angola."
