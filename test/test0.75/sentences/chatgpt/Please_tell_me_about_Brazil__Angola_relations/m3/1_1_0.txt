  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Brazil recognized Angola's independence soon after it gained sovereignty from Portugal in 1975. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 2 emphasizing that Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's sovereignty. Overall, both statements support the idea that Brazil and Angola have a longstanding relationship, which includes diplomatic recognition and economic ties."
