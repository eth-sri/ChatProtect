Statement 1 highlights the economic aspect of the relationship, emphasizing the importance of trade between the two countries. Statement 2, on the other hand, emphasizes the overall partnership between Brazil and Angola, suggesting that the relationship extends beyond just economic ties. Both statements provide different perspectives on the Brazil-Angola relationship, but they do not contradict each other."
