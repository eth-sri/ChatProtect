Both statements highlight the fact that Brazil and Angola have had a relationship for several decades, with the first statement emphasizing the longevity of the relationship and the second statement specifically mentioning the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975. Together, these statements provide a brief overview of the history of the relationship between the two countries."
