  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that Brazil exports a wide range of goods to Angola, while Angola exports primarily oil and diamonds to Brazil. However, Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that Angola primarily exports oil to Brazil. While both statements mention the importance of oil in the trade relationship between the two countries, they differ in their emphasis on other types of exports."
