  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the strengthening of the relationship between the two countries in recent years, with increased trade and cultural exchange. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions the fact that they have had diplomatic relations since 1976, while statement 2 focuses more on the recent growth in their relationship. Overall, both statements support the idea that Brazil and Angola have a positive and growing relationship."
