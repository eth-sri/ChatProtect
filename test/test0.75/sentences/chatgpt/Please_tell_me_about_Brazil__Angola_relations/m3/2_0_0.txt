  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention the same fact that Brazil and Angola have had diplomatic relations since the mid-1970s. The only difference is that statement 2 provides additional context by specifying that Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, which is likely the reason why diplomatic relations were established at that time. Overall, both statements support the idea that Brazil and Angola have a longstanding diplomatic relationship."
