  "alt": "Brazil and Angola have signed several agreements to strengthen their cooperation in various fields, including agriculture, energy, and defense.",
  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long history of diplomatic and economic relations. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil recognized the new government soon after. In 1980, Brazil opened an embassy in Angola, and Angola reciprocated by opening an embassy in Brazil in 1984. The two countries have a significant trade relationship, with Brazil being Angola's largest trading partner. Brazil exports food, machinery, and other goods to Angola, while Angola exports oil and diamonds to Brazil. In recent years, Brazil has also invested in infrastructure projects in Angola, such as building roads and ports. Brazil and Angola have also cooperated in the areas of education and health. Brazil has provided scholarships for Angolan students to study in Brazilian universities, and has also sent medical personnel to Angola to help with public health initiatives. However, there have been some tensions in the relationship between the two countries. In 2015, Brazil temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Angolan officials due to concerns about corruption. Additionally, there have been concerns about the treatment of Angolan immigrants in Brazil, particularly in the labor market.",
