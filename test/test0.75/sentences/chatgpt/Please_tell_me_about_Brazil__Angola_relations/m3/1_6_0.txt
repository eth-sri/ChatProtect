  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long history of diplomatic and economic relations. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil recognized the new government soon after. In 1980, Brazil opened an embassy in Angola, and Angola reciprocated by opening an embassy in Brazil in 1984. The two countries have a significant trade relationship, with Brazil being Angola's largest trading partner. Brazil exports food, machinery, and other goods to Angola, while Angola exports oil and diamonds to Brazil. In recent years, Brazil has also invested in infrastructure projects in Angola, such as building roads and ports.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention cooperation between the two countries, but they differ in the specific areas of cooperation. Statement 1 mentions education and health, while statement 2 mentions education and culture. These are not mutually exclusive areas of cooperation, and it is possible for both to be true. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
