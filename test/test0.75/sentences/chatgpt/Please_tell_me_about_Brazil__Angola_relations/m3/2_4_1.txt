  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the involvement of Brazilian companies in Angola's oil industry, but they focus on different aspects. Statement 1 mentions the involvement of Brazilian companies in the oil and gas sector, while Statement 2 highlights their involvement in the construction of housing projects and the development of the oil industry. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive picture of the Brazil-Angola relations."
