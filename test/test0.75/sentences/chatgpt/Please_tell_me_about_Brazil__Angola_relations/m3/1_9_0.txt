  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long history of diplomatic and economic relations. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil recognized the new government soon after. In 1980, Brazil opened an embassy in Angola, and Angola reciprocated by opening an embassy in Brazil in 1984. The two countries have a significant trade relationship, with Brazil being Angola's largest trading partner. Brazil exports food, machinery, and other goods to Angola, while Angola exports oil and diamonds to Brazil. In recent years, Brazil has also invested in infrastructure projects in Angola, such as building roads and ports. Brazil and Angola have also cooperated in the areas of education and health. Brazil has provided scholarships for Angolan students to study in Brazilian universities, and has also sent medical personnel to Angola to help with public health initiatives. However, there have been some tensions in the relationship between the two countries.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but they do highlight different issues that have caused temporary suspensions of visa issuance by Brazil. The first statement mentions concerns about corruption among Angolan officials, while the second statement cites concerns over irregular migration by Angolan citizens. These are separate issues that have led to different actions by Brazil, but they do not contradict each other. Overall, the relationship between Brazil and Angola has been characterized by diplomatic and economic cooperation, but there have also been challenges and tensions along the way."
