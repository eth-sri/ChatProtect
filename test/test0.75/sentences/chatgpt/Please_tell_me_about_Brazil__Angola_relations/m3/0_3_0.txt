  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but rather provide different details about the types of goods that Brazil exports to Angola. Statement 1 specifies machinery, vehicles, and chemicals, while also noting that Angola primarily exports oil and diamonds to Brazil. Statement 2 expands on the types of goods Brazil exports to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products. Both statements are consistent with the overall theme of strong economic ties between the two countries."
