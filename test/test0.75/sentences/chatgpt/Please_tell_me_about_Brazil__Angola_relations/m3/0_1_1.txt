  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the common history of Portuguese colonial rule that the two countries share, which has led to the development of strong cultural and economic ties between them. The only difference between the two statements is the order in which the aspects of the relationship are mentioned. Statement 1 mentions economic, political, and cultural ties, while Statement 2 mentions cultural and economic ties. However, both statements convey the same idea that the relationship between Brazil and Angola is built on a shared history and strong ties."
