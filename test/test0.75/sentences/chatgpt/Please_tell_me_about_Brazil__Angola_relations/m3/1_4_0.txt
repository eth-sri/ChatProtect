  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention Brazil's exports to Angola, including machinery and food products. However, statement 1 also mentions Angola's exports to Brazil, which are oil and diamonds. Statement 2 does not mention Angola's exports to Brazil. Therefore, the statements provide complementary information about the trade relationship between the two countries."
