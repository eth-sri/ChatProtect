  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 states that he became regent in 1848 after his brother abdicated, while statement 2 states that he became regent after his brother's death in 1853 and abdicated in 1869. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different timelines for when Prince Albert became regent."
