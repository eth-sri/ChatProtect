  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention his interest in botany and zoology, with the second statement adding that he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1856. This additional information does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides further evidence of Prince Albert's interest and involvement in the field of science."
