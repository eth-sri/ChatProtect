  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory, but they are repetitive. Both statements mention his military career and specifically his involvement in the Austro-Prussian War. However, statement 1 also includes his participation in the Second Schleswig War, while statement 2 does not. Overall, both statements provide additional information about Prince Albert's life and accomplishments beyond his role as regent of Saxe-Altenburg."
