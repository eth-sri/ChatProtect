In 1844, he married Princess Marie of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia and Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. They had six children together, including Ernst II, who would later become the last reigning Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. In 1848, Prince Albert became regent of Saxe-Altenburg after his brother, Duke Ernst I, abdicated. He ruled as regent until his nephew, Ernst II, came of age in 1853. Prince Albert was also a successful military commander, serving in the Prussian Army during the Second Schleswig War and the Austro-Prussian War. He retired from military service in 1866 with the rank of General of the Infantry.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 states that he retired from public life after his wife's death in 1888 and lived in seclusion until his death in 1902, while statement 2 states that he retired from public life in 1900 and died two years later. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different timelines for when Prince Albert retired from public life."
