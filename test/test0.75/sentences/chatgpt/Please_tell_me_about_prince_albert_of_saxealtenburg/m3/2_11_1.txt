He was born on April 14, 1819, in Hildburghausen, Thuringia, and was the second son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Prince Albert received a rigorous education and showed a keen interest in the arts and sciences. He was particularly interested in botany and zoology and became an accomplished amateur scientist. He also had a passion for music and played several instruments. In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands. The couple had six children, including Prince Ernst II, who succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. When his older brother, Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, abdicated in November 1848, Prince Albert became the new Duke. He faced several challenges during his reign, including financial difficulties and political unrest. However, he managed to maintain stability and worked to modernize the duchy's infrastructure and economy. Prince Albert was also known for his philanthropy and supported several charitable causes.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory, but they differ in the specific location of the hospital and women's shelter he established. Statement 1 mentions that he established them in Altenburg and funded the construction of public buildings, while Statement 2 only mentions the hospital and women's shelter in Saxe-Altenburg. However, both statements agree that Prince Albert was a philanthropist who supported charitable causes."
