  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that he became regent of Saxe-Altenburg after his brother abdicated in 1848, while statement 2 explains that he became a member of the First Chamber of the Landtag of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg in the same year. Both statements are consistent with Prince Albert's involvement in the governance of Saxe-Altenburg during this time period."
