  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 states that he married Princess Marie of Prussia in 1844, while statement 2 states that he married her in 1843. Since the two statements provide different years for the marriage, they cannot both be true."
