He was born on April 14, 1819, in Hildburghausen, Thuringia, and was the second son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Prince Albert received a rigorous education and showed a keen interest in the arts and sciences. He was particularly interested in botany and zoology and became an accomplished amateur scientist.

In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands.
