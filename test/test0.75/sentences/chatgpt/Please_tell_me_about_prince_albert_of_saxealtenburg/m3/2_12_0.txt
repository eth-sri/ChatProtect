  "prefix": " Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1819-1902) was a German prince who served as the reigning Duke of Saxe-Altenburg from 1848 until 1893. He was born on April 14, 1819, in Hildburghausen, Thuringia, and was the second son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Prince Albert received a rigorous education and showed a keen interest in the arts and sciences. He was particularly interested in botany and zoology and became an accomplished amateur scientist. He also had a passion for music and played several instruments. In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands. The couple had six children, including Prince Ernst II, who succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. When his older brother, Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, abdicated in November 1848, Prince Albert became the new Duke. He faced several challenges during his reign, including financial difficulties and political unrest. However, he managed to maintain stability and worked to modernize the duchy's infrastructure and economy. Prince Albert was also known for his philanthropy and supported several charitable causes. He established a hospital and a women's shelter in Altenburg and funded the construction of several public buildings, including schools and libraries.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Prince Albert abdicated in 1893, but statement 1 provides the reason for his abdication (health reasons), while statement 2 provides the length of his reign (45 years). These statements complement each other and provide additional information about Prince Albert's life and reign."
