  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the same aspect of the style, which is a focus on traditional craftsmanship and a rejection of mass-produced goods. The first statement provides additional context by explaining that this focus was a reaction against the Industrial Revolution's mass-produced architecture, while the second statement simply states this characteristic. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea."
