It was a reaction against the mass-produced goods of the Industrial Revolution and emphasized traditional craftsmanship and materials. The style is characterized by its use of natural materials, such as stone, brick, and wood, and its attention to detail. Common features include asymmetrical facades, steeply pitched roofs, and decorative elements such as stained glass windows, intricate woodwork, and decorative tiles.",
