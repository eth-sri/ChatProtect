  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different emphasis on the common features of the style. Both statements mention steeply pitched roofs and asymmetrical facades as defining characteristics, but the first statement highlights stained glass windows, intricate woodwork, and decorative tiles as additional decorative elements, while the second statement emphasizes exposed rafters and brackets. Overall, both statements provide accurate descriptions of the style's key features."
