  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different perspectives on the timing of the movement's emergence. Statement 1 emphasizes the flourishing of the movement, suggesting that it was well-established and widespread during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Statement 2, on the other hand, focuses on the emergence of the movement, suggesting that it began to gain momentum in the late 19th century. Both statements are accurate and provide complementary information about the history of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
