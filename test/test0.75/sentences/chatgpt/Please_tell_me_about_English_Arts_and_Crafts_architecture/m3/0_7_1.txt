  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture was a movement that flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in England. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made objects of the Industrial Revolution and the ornate, over-decorated styles of the Victorian era. The Arts and Crafts movement sought to revive traditional crafts and techniques, emphasizing simplicity, quality, and functionality. The architecture of the Arts and Crafts movement was characterized by a focus on handcrafted details, natural materials, and an integration with the surrounding landscape. The movement was influenced by the medieval architecture of England and the Arts and Crafts movement in Europe. Houses built in the English Arts and Crafts style often feature steeply pitched roofs, asymmetrical facades, and handcrafted details such as decorative brackets, exposed beams, and carved woodwork. The interiors of these homes often include open floor plans, built-in cabinetry, and natural materials such as stone and wood.",
