  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made architecture of the Industrial Revolution and sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The style emphasized simplicity, honesty, and a connection to nature. English Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by several features, including:\n\n1. Natural materials: The style emphasized the use of natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick. 2. Handcrafted details: The style favored handcrafted details such as decorative carvings, wrought-iron details, and stained-glass windows. 3. Symmetry: Buildings in the Arts and Crafts style were often symmetrical, with a central entrance and balanced proportions. 4.",
