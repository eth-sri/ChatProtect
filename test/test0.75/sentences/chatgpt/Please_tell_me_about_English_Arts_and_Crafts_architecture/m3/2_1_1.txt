  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the same idea of reviving traditional craftsmanship and techniques, and the use of natural materials. The first statement adds that this style emerged as a reaction against the mass-produced architecture of the Industrial Revolution, while the second statement highlights the importance of handmade objects. However, both statements are complementary and contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
