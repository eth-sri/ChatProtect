  "explanation": "The two statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. They both describe the movement's emphasis on traditional craftsmanship and rejection of mass-produced goods, but from different perspectives. Statement 1 highlights the movement's reaction against the Industrial Revolution and Victorian era styles, while Statement 2 emphasizes the movement's focus on traditional craftsmanship. Together, they provide a more complete picture of the movement's values and goals."
