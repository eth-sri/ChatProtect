  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight different aspects of the style, with statement 1 emphasizing a connection to nature and statement 2 emphasizing the use of local materials and functionality. Both aspects were important to the Arts and Crafts movement, which sought to create a more authentic and meaningful approach to design and architecture. Therefore, the two statements provide a more complete picture of the style and its values."
