It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made objects of the Industrial Revolution and the ornate, over-decorated styles of the Victorian era. The Arts and Crafts movement sought to revive traditional crafts and techniques, emphasizing simplicity, quality, and functionality. The architecture of the Arts and Crafts movement was characterized by a focus on handcrafted details, natural materials, and an integration with the surrounding landscape.",
