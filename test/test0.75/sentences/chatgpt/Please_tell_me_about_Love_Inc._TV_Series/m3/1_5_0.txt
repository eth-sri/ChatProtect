The show follows a group of dating consultants at a New York City-based matchmaking service called \"Love, Inc.\" In each episode, the team helps a different client find love, while also dealing with their own personal lives and relationships. The main characters include Denise Johnson (played by Busy Philipps), the office manager and dating coach who dreams of finding her own perfect match; Francine (played by Regan Gomez-Preston), the tough-talking and ambitious lead dating consultant; and Clea (played by Holly Robinson Peete), the divorced mother of two who has a hard time balancing work and family life. Other recurring characters include Barry (played by Vince Vieluf), the quirky and socially awkward IT guy; and Viviana (played by Ion Overman), the office receptionist who is always looking for love. Love, Inc. received mixed reviews from critics and struggled in the ratings, leading to its cancellation after only one season.",
