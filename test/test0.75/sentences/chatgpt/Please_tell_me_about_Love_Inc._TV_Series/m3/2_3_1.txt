  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Love, Inc. (TV Series) are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the main character is Clea, played by Holly Robinson Peete, while Statement 2 states that Clea Lewis played the role of Viviana, one of the dating consultants at Love, Inc. These are two different characters played by two different actresses, so the statements cannot both be true."
