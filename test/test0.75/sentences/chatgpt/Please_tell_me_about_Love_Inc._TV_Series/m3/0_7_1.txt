  "explanation": "The statements about Love, Inc. (TV Series) are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the show has gained a cult following, but they differ in the genre of fans who appreciate it. Statement 1 suggests that the show has gained a following among fans of sitcoms, while statement 2 suggests that it has gained a following among fans of romantic comedies.
