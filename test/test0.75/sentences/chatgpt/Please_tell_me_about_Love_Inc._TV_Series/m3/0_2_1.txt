  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Love, Inc. (TV Series) are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Denise Johnson as the main character of the show, but incorrectly states that she was played by Busy Philipps. In fact, Denise Johnson was played by actress Holly Robinson Peete. Statement 2 is incorrect in both the character name and the actress who played it. There is no character named Francine in Love, Inc. and Busy Philipps did not appear in the show."
