  "prefix": " Love, Inc. is a romantic comedy television series that aired on the UPN network from September 2005 to May 2006. The show revolves around a group of dating consultants who work for a company called Love, Inc. The company's founder, Denise Johnson (played by Busy Philipps), is a former dating consultant who now runs the company and oversees her team of quirky employees. The main character is Clea, played by Holly Robinson Peete, who is the team's lead dating consultant. Other members of the team include Francine (played by Reagan Gomez-Preston), a former client of the company who is now a consultant, and Barry (played by Vince Vieluf), a quirky and enthusiastic member of the team. The show follows the team as they help clients navigate the world of dating and find love. Each episode features a new client with a unique set of dating problems, and the team works together to come up with solutions. Along the way, the team members also deal with their own romantic and personal struggles. Despite positive reviews, Love, Inc. was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements express the same idea that Love, Inc. is a hidden gem of early 2000s television, despite its cancellation after one season due to low ratings. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes that it has gained a cult following since its cancellation, while statement 2 simply states that it is considered a hidden gem."
