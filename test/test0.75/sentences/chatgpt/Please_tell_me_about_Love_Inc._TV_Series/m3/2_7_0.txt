  "explanation": "The statements about Love, Inc. (TV Series) are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the team members deal with their own romantic and personal struggles or entanglements throughout the series. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 2 specifically mentioning \"romantic entanglements\" while statement 1 uses the more general term \"personal struggles.\" However, both statements convey the same idea that the show explores the personal lives of the characters in addition to their work at Love, Inc."
