  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Molla was born in Ethiopia and came to Israel in 1984 as part of Operation Moses. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes that Molla was brought as a child refugee, while statement 1 focuses on his political career as a former member of the Knesset. Overall, the statements provide complementary information about Molla's background and experiences."
