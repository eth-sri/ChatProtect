  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. Statement 1 states that he was born in Ethiopia in 1960 and immigrated to Israel in 1984, while statement 2 states that he was born in Ethiopia in 1963. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about his birth year."
