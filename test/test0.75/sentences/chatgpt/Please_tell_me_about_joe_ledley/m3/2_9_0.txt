  "explanation": "The statements about Joe Ledley are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his charitable work and support for organizations focused on cancer research and children's hospitals. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions his support for Children with Cancer UK, while statement 2 refers to his support for \"children's hospitals and cancer research organizations\" in general. However, both statements convey the same message that Ledley is actively involved in charitable work and supports causes related to cancer and children's health."
