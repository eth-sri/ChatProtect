  "explanation": "The statements about Joe Ledley are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he made over 250 appearances for Cardiff City and helped them reach the FA Cup final in 2008, while Statement 2 says that he made over 200 appearances for the club before moving on to play for other teams. The numbers of appearances given in the two statements do not match, which makes them contradictory."
