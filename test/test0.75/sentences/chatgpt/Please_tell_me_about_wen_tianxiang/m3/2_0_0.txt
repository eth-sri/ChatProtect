  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was a scholar, military general, and lived during the late Song dynasty in China. The only difference is that the first statement also adds that he was a patriot, while the second statement adds that he was a statesman. These are not contradictory, but rather complementary descriptions of his life and achievements."
