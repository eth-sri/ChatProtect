Wen Tianxiang was known for his loyalty and patriotism towards his dynasty, and his unwavering resistance against the Mongol invaders. In 1276, the Southern Song dynasty was conquered by the Mongol Empire. The emperor of the dynasty was forced to flee to the south, while the Mongols established their capital in the north. Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender to the Mongols and was captured by them in 1278.",

Both statements mention that he declined to serve the Mongol Empire and was subsequently executed for his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that he was offered a position in the Mongol administration before his execution, while statement 2 does not mention this detail."
