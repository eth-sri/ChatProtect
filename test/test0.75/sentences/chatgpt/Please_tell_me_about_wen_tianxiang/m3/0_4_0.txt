  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that he fell out of favor with the emperor due to his opposition to the peace treaty with the Mongols, while the second statement mentions that he was appointed as the Minister of War. These statements do not contradict each other as they refer to different points in time. It is possible that Wen Tianxiang was appointed as the Minister of War before or after he fell out of favor with the emperor."
