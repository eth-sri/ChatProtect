Wen Tianxiang was known for his loyalty and patriotism towards his dynasty, and his unwavering resistance against the Mongol invaders. In 1276, the Southern Song dynasty was conquered by the Mongol Empire. The emperor of the dynasty was forced to flee to the south, while the Mongols established their capital in the north.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. They both state that he refused to surrender to the Mongols and was captured by them in 1278. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which omits the word \"to\" after \"surrender.\" However, this does not change the meaning of the statement."
