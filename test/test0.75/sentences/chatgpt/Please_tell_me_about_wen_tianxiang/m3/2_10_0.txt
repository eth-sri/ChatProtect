  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang was a Chinese scholar, general, and patriot who lived during the late Southern Song dynasty. He was born in 1236 in present-day Guangdong Province, China. Wen Tianxiang was known for his loyalty and patriotism towards his dynasty, and his unwavering resistance against the Mongol invaders. In 1276, the Southern Song dynasty was conquered by the Mongol Empire. The emperor of the dynasty was forced to flee to the south, while the Mongols established their capital in the north. Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender to the Mongols and was captured by them in 1278. He was offered a position in the Mongol administration, but he declined and was subsequently executed for his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Wen Tianxiang was also a renowned scholar and poet. His most famous poem \"The Song of Righteousness\" is a declaration of his loyalty to his country and his determination to resist the Mongol invaders. His writings and poems continue to inspire Chinese patriots to this day.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was posthumously awarded a title by the Ming dynasty in recognition of his loyalty and patriotism towards his country and dynasty. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he was awarded the title of \"loyal and righteous duke,\" while statement 1 does not mention the specific title."
