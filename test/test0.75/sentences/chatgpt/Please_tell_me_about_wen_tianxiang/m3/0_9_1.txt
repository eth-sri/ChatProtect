  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a famous Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song dynasty. He is best known for his patriotism and loyalty to the Song dynasty, which was constantly under threat from the invading Mongol armies. Wen Tianxiang was born into a family of scholars and officials in modern-day Suzhou, Jiangsu province. He was an accomplished scholar and passed the imperial examination at a young age. In 1275, he was appointed as the prime minister of the Song dynasty, but he soon fell out of favor with the emperor due to his outspoken opposition to the peace treaty with the Mongols. When the Mongol armies invaded the Song dynasty in 1276, Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender and led his troops into battle. He fought valiantly against the invaders but was eventually captured and taken prisoner. Despite being offered a pardon in exchange for his loyalty to the Mongol empire, Wen Tianxiang refused to betray his principles and was executed in 1283. Wen Tianxiang is remembered as a symbol of loyalty, patriotism, and resistance against foreign invaders.",
