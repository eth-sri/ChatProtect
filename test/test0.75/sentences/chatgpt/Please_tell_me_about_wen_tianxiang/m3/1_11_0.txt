  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a famous scholar, general, and politician of the Southern Song Dynasty in China. He was born in Hengyang, Hunan Province and became a scholar at the age of 20. He passed the imperial examination and was appointed as a government official. However, during the Mongol invasion of China, he decided to fight for his country and joined the military. Wen Tianxiang was known for his patriotism and loyalty to the Southern Song Dynasty. He served as a general in the army and fought against the Mongols in many battles. He was also a talented poet and wrote many poems about his love for his country and his desire to defend it. In 1278, he was captured by the Mongols and brought to the capital city of Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing). He was offered a high position in the Mongol government if he agreed to serve them, but he refused. Instead, he chose to remain loyal to his country and his emperor, and he was executed in 1283. After his death, Wen Tianxiang became a symbol of patriotism and loyalty in Chinese history.",
