Wen Tianxiang was born into a family of scholars and officials in modern-day Suzhou, Jiangsu province. He was an accomplished scholar and passed the imperial examination at a young age. In 1275, he was appointed as the prime minister of the Song dynasty, but he soon fell out of favor with the emperor due to his outspoken opposition to the peace treaty with the Mongols.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. The first statement highlights his refusal to surrender and his leadership in battle against the invading Mongol armies, while the second statement provides context about the historical situation in which Wen Tianxiang lived and the constant threat posed by the Mongol armies to the Song dynasty. Both statements are consistent with the portrayal of Wen Tianxiang as a patriotic and loyal defender of the Song dynasty against external threats."
