Wen Tianxiang was known for his loyalty and patriotism towards his dynasty, and his unwavering resistance against the Mongol invaders. In 1276, the Southern Song dynasty was conquered by the Mongol Empire. The emperor of the dynasty was forced to flee to the south, while the Mongols established their capital in the north. Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender to the Mongols and was captured by them in 1278. He was offered a position in the Mongol administration, but he declined and was subsequently executed for his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Wen Tianxiang was also a renowned scholar and poet.",
