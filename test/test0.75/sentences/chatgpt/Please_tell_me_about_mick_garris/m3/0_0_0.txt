  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"Please tell me about Mick Garris\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Mick Garris as a filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, and author, while Statement 2 only mentions him as a filmmaker and screenwriter. The inclusion of \"producer\" and \"author\" in Statement 1 expands on Mick Garris's professional background and accomplishments, which is not mentioned in Statement 2. Therefore, the two statements provide different levels of information about Mick Garris's career, making them contradictory."
