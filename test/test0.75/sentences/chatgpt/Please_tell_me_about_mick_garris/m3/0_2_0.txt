  "explanation": "The statements about Mick Garris are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he is best known for his work in the horror genre and has directed several horror films, including \"Sleepwalkers,\" \"The Stand,\" and \"The Shining\" miniseries. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he has directed several Stephen King adaptations, while statement 1 does not mention King specifically. However, this does not contradict the information in statement 1."
