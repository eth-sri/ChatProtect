  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour heard about the My Lai Massacre, but they differ in the source of the information. Statement 1 states that Ridenhour heard rumors about the massacre, while statement 2 mentions that Ridenhour heard about it from fellow soldiers who had participated in the operation. These statements provide complementary information about how Ridenhour became aware of the My Lai Massacre."
