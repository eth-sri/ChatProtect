Ridenhour served in Vietnam as a helicopter door gunner in 1967-68. After his service, he attended college and became a journalist. In 1969, he heard stories of a massacre of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers in My Lai, Vietnam. He began to investigate the incident, tracking down witnesses and gathering evidence. In March 1969, Ridenhour wrote letters to several high-ranking officials, including President Nixon, detailing what he had discovered about the massacre. His letters helped to bring attention to the incident and led to an Army investigation.",
