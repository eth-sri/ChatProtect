  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. The first statement explains that after his service in Vietnam, Ridenhour pursued a career in journalism. The second statement elaborates on his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, which he became involved in after hearing about it from other soldiers. Both statements provide additional information about Ridenhour's life and career, but they do not contradict each other."
