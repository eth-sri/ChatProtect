In 1969, Ridenhour heard rumors about the massacre of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in My Lai by American soldiers. He began investigating the incident and eventually gathered evidence and testimony from witnesses, which he presented to the Pentagon and the media. Ridenhour's efforts led to a military investigation and the subsequent trial of Lieutenant William Calley, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Ridenhour's bravery and determination to uncover the truth helped to bring attention to the atrocities committed during the Vietnam War and inspired others to speak out against the war.",
