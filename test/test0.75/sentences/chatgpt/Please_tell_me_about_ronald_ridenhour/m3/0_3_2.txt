They both highlight his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre and the subsequent trial and conviction of Lieutenant William Calley. Statement 1 emphasizes Ridenhour's efforts in initiating the investigation, while Statement 2 highlights the outcome of the trial and Calley's sentencing, which was partly due to Ridenhour's actions.
