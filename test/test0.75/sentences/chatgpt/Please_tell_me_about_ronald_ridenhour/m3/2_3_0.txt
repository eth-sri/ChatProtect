  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour wrote letters to government officials, including the President, detailing what he had learned about the My Lai Massacre. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he wrote to Congress and the Pentagon as well. However, both statements convey the same information about Ridenhour's actions in exposing the war crime."
