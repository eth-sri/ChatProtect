  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements describe how Ridenhour began investigating the My Lai Massacre and gathering evidence to support the claims of the massacre. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that Ridenhour presented the evidence to the Pentagon and the media, while statement 2 does not mention this. However, this does not contradict the fact that Ridenhour gathered evidence and investigated the incident."
