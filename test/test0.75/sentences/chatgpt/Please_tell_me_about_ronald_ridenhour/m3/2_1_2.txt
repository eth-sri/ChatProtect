  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by American troops during the Vietnam War. The first statement emphasizes his fame for bringing the massacre to light, while the second statement provides more detail about how he conducted an investigation and uncovered evidence of the atrocity. Together, the statements paint a picture of Ronald Ridenhour as a courageous soldier who spoke out against injustice and helped to bring accountability to those responsible for the massacre."
