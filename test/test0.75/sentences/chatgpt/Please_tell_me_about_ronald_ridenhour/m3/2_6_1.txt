He became famous for exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by American troops in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. In 1969, Ridenhour heard rumors about the massacre and began investigating. He wrote letters to government officials, including the President of the United States, detailing what he had heard. His letters eventually led to a full investigation and the prosecution of several soldiers involved in the massacre. Ridenhour received numerous awards for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, including the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award and the Ridenhour Courage Prize, named in his honor.",
