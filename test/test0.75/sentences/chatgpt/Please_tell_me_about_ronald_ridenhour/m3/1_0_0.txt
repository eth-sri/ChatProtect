  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention his involvement in the Vietnam War, with the first statement specifically highlighting his efforts to expose the My Lai Massacre. The second statement simply states that he was a Vietnam War veteran, which is consistent with the first statement. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
