  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. They both describe his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, which was a war crime committed by American troops during the Vietnam War. The first statement highlights his fame for bringing attention to the massacre, while the second statement emphasizes his actions as a whistleblower in sending a letter to Congress detailing the event. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of Ronald Ridenhour's contribution to exposing the truth about the My Lai Massacre."
