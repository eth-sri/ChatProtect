  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor known for his naturalistic and erotic works. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer gained recognition for his realistic depictions of animals and his busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand. However, his most controversial work was the sculpture Woman Bitten by a Snake, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1847. The sculpture depicted a naked woman being bitten by a snake while writhing in ecstasy. The work was deemed scandalous and caused a public outrage, but it also garnered Cl\u00e9singer a great deal of attention. Cl\u00e9singer's personal life was also the subject of scandal. He was married to the writer George Sand, with whom he had two children. However, Sand left him for another man, the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Cl\u00e9singer was later involved in a public altercation with Chopin's sister over the composer's estate. Despite the controversies surrounding his personal life and art, Cl\u00e9singer continued to produce highly original and expressive sculptures until his death in 1883.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention that his works can be found in museums and private collections around the world, which is a fact that is widely accepted and acknowledged. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"various\" in statement 2, which simply adds a bit more specificity to the statement. Overall, both statements provide additional information about the reach and impact of Cl\u00e9singer's work."
