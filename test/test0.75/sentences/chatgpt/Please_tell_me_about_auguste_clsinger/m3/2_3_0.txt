  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention his influence from Michelangelo and his naturalistic style in sculpture. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions his sculptures depicting everyday life, while statement 2 mentions his influence from Italian Renaissance sculptors in general. However, both statements are consistent with Cl\u00e9singer's overall artistic style and influences."
