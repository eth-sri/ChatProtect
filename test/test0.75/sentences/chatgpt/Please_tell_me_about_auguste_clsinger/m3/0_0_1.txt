  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements mention his use of erotic themes in his sculptures, but they differ in describing his style. The first statement emphasizes his naturalistic approach, while the second statement highlights his neoclassical style. Therefore, the statements provide different perspectives on Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style and subject matter."
