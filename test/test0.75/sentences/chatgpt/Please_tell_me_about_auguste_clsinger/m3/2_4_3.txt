  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements refer to his famous sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its erotic content. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes the scandal caused by the sculpture, while statement 2 focuses on the fact that it was first exhibited at the Salon in Paris in 1847."
