  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 associates him with the Realist movement, while Statement 2 associates him with the Romantic movement. These two movements had different artistic styles and philosophies, with Realism emphasizing objective representation of reality and Romanticism emphasizing subjective emotions and imagination. Therefore, it is not possible for Cl\u00e9singer to be both a Realist and a Romantic artist at the same time."
