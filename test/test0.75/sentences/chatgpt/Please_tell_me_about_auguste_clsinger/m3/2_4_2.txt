They both refer to the same sculpture, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and both mention the controversy it caused due to its erotic content. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the fact that it is one of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works, while statement 2 focuses solely on the controversy surrounding the sculpture."
