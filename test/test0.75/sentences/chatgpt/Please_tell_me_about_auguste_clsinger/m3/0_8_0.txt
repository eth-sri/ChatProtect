  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor known for his naturalistic and erotic works. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer gained recognition for his realistic depictions of animals and his busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand. However, his most controversial work was the sculpture Woman Bitten by a Snake, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1847. The sculpture depicted a naked woman being bitten by a snake while writhing in ecstasy. The work was deemed scandalous and caused a public outrage, but it also garnered Cl\u00e9singer a great deal of attention. Cl\u00e9singer's personal life was also the subject of scandal. He was married to the writer George Sand, with whom he had two children.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about his personal life and relationship with George Sand. Statement 1 explains that Sand left Cl\u00e9singer for another man, while statement 2 clarifies that Sand left him after discovering his infidelity. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Sand and Cl\u00e9singer's marriage ended due to personal issues."
