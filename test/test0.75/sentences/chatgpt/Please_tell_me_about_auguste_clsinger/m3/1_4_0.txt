  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 says that his famous sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" is on display at the Louvre Museum, while statement 2 says that the same sculpture is housed in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. These two museums are different, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
