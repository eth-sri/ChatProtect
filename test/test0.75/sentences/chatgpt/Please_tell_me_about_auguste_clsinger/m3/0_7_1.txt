He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer gained recognition for his realistic depictions of animals and his busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand. However, his most controversial work was the sculpture Woman Bitten by a Snake, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1847. The sculpture depicted a naked woman being bitten by a snake while writhing in ecstasy. The work was deemed scandalous and caused a public outrage, but it also garnered Cl\u00e9singer a great deal of attention. Cl\u00e9singer's personal life was also the subject of scandal.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but they present different aspects of his relationship with the writer George Sand. Statement 1 indicates that Cl\u00e9singer was married to Sand and had children with her, while statement 2 highlights their tumultuous relationship as lovers and muses. Both statements can be true at the same time, as Cl\u00e9singer and Sand had a complex and multifaceted relationship that evolved over time."
