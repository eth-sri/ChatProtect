  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer's sculpture of the \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" are not contradictory. They both describe the sculpture as having intricate details and a lifelike depiction of the goddess in distress. The only difference is in the specific wording used to describe the depiction of the goddess, with one statement using the word \"realistic\" and the other using \"lifelike.\" However, both statements convey the same overall meaning and do not contradict each other."
