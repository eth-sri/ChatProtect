  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor known for his naturalistic and erotic works. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer gained recognition for his realistic depictions of animals and his busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand. However, his most controversial work was the sculpture Woman Bitten by a Snake, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1847. The sculpture depicted a naked woman being bitten by a snake while writhing in ecstasy. The work was deemed scandalous and caused a public outrage, but it also garnered Cl\u00e9singer a great deal of attention. Cl\u00e9singer's personal life was also the subject of scandal. He was married to the writer George Sand, with whom he had two children. However, Sand left him for another man, the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. The first statement mentions a public altercation with Chopin's sister over the composer's estate, which could suggest some conflict or controversy in Cl\u00e9singer's life. The second statement mentions his appointment as a professor of sculpture at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which suggests a level of professional success and recognition. These two statements do not contradict each other and can both be true."
