  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor known for his naturalistic and erotic works. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer gained recognition for his realistic depictions of animals and his busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand. However, his most controversial work was the sculpture Woman Bitten by a Snake, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1847. The sculpture depicted a naked woman being bitten by a snake while writhing in ecstasy. The work was deemed scandalous and caused a public outrage, but it also garnered Cl\u00e9singer a great deal of attention. Cl\u00e9singer's personal life was also the subject of scandal. He was married to the writer George Sand, with whom he had two children. However, Sand left him for another man, the composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but they are unrelated. Statement 1 discusses Cl\u00e9singer's involvement in a legal dispute over Chopin's estate, while Statement 2 mentions his involvement in the French Revolution of 1848. Both statements provide additional information about Cl\u00e9singer's life, but they do not contradict each other."
