  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. The first statement describes his style as realistic and naturalistic, while the second statement describes his style as neoclassical and focused on mythological figures. These two styles are quite different from each other, so the statements cannot both be true."
