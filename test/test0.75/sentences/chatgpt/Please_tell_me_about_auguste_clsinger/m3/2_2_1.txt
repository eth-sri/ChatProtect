  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 associates him with the Realist movement, while Statement 2 associates him with the Romantic movement. While there may be some overlap between the two movements, they are generally considered distinct and separate artistic movements with different styles and philosophies. Therefore, it is not possible for Cl\u00e9singer to be a prominent member of both movements simultaneously."
