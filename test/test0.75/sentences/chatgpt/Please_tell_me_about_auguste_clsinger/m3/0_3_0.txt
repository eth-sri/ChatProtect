  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather they provide different levels of detail about the same topic. Both statements refer to Cl\u00e9singer's most controversial work, the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and highlight its scandalous nature and the public outcry it caused. The only difference is that statement 2 provides more specific information about the sculpture's eroticism and the year it was exhibited."
