  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who wrote extensively about education and child development. He is best known for his advocacy of progressive education, which emphasizes the importance of child-centered learning and self-directed exploration. Holt began his career as a teacher, but soon became disillusioned with traditional educational practices and began to explore alternative approaches. He became a prominent critic of the American education system, arguing that it was too focused on testing and grading, and that it failed to cultivate creativity and curiosity in students. In his books, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981), Holt argued for a more child-centered approach to education, in which children are given the freedom to explore and learn at their own pace. He also advocated for homeschooling and unschooling, arguing that children can learn more effectively outside of traditional classroom settings.",
