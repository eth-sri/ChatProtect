  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was a critic of traditional schooling methods and believed that children should be allowed to learn in a more natural and unstructured way. Holt believed that children were naturally curious and would learn best if they were allowed to explore and discover on their own. Holt wrote many books on education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981). His writings had a profound impact on the homeschooling and unschooling movements, and he is considered a pioneer in these fields. In addition to his work as an educator and author, Holt was also a musician and a political activist. He was involved in the civil rights movement and spoke out against the Vietnam War.",
