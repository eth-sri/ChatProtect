  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that traditional schooling systems were inherently flawed and failed to provide children with a meaningful education. Holt's writings and teachings emphasized the importance of allowing children to learn at their own pace and follow their own interests, rather than forcing them to conform to a standardized curriculum. Holt's most famous book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964 and sparked a national conversation about the shortcomings of traditional schooling. He went on to write several more books, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Teach Your Own,\" and \"Escape from Childhood,\" which further developed his ideas about education and child-rearing. In addition to his writing, Holt was a prominent figure in the homeschooling movement and helped to establish several organizations that promoted alternative educational approaches. He believed that children were naturally curious and capable of learning on their own, and that it was the role of adults to facilitate and support their learning.",
