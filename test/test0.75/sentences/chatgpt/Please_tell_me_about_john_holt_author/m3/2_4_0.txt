  "explanation": "The statements about John Holt are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his advocacy for child-centered learning and self-directed exploration, which he believed was essential for cultivating creativity and curiosity in students. The first statement specifically mentions his books, which further elaborate on his ideas and proposals for alternative approaches to education. The second statement emphasizes Holt's belief that children learn best when they are allowed to pursue their own interests, which aligns with his overall philosophy of progressive education. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a comprehensive overview of John Holt's contributions to the field of education."
