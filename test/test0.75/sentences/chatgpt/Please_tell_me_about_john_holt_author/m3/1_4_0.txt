  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that traditional schooling systems were inherently flawed and failed to provide children with a meaningful education. Holt's writings and teachings emphasized the importance of allowing children to learn at their own pace and follow their own interests, rather than forcing them to conform to a standardized curriculum. Holt's most famous book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964 and sparked a national conversation about the shortcomings of traditional schooling.",
