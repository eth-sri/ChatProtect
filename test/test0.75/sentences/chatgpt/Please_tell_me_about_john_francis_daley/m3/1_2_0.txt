Statement 1 suggests that Daley is best known for his roles in \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Waiting...\" as well as his appearances in other popular TV shows and movies. However, Statement 2 suggests that Daley is best known for his role as Dr. Lance Sweets on \"Bones.\" These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they offer different answers to the same question."
