Both statements mention his work as a director, with statement 1 specifically mentioning \"Vacation\" and statement 2 mentioning \"The Goldbergs\" in addition to \"Bones.\" Both statements also mention his writing partnership with Jonathan Goldstein. The only difference is that statement 2 includes \"The Goldbergs\" as a show he has directed, while statement 1 does not. However, this does not contradict the information in statement 1, as it is simply an additional detail mentioned in statement 2."
