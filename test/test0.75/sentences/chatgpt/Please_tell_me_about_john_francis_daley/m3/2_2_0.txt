  "explanation": "The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory, but rather they provide different perspectives on his career. Statement 1 highlights his overall career, including his work as a screenwriter, director, and comedian, while also mentioning his notable acting roles in Freaks and Geeks and Bones. Statement 2, on the other hand, specifically focuses on his role as Sam Weir in Freaks and Geeks, which was a breakout role for him. Both statements are true and accurate, but they simply emphasize different aspects of his career."
