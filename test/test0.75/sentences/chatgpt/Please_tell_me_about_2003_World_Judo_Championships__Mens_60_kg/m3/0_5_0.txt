  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba defeated Choi Min-ho of South Korea and Georgi Georgiev of Bulgaria defeated Ruben Houkes of the Netherlands to win the bronze medals. However, Statement 2 claims that Arencibia defeated Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France to win the bronze medal. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about who won the bronze medal matches."
