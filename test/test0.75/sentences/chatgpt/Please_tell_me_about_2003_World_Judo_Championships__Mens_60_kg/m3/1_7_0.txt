  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. While statement 1 highlights the upsets that occurred during the competition, statement 2 focuses on the high level of technical skill and sportsmanship displayed by the judokas. These two statements can coexist as they are not mutually exclusive. It is possible for there to be upsets in a competition while still maintaining a high level of technical skill and sportsmanship."
