  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Hiroaki Hiraoka was the number two seed in the competition and that he lost to Dong Han Gwak in the final. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that Hiraoka won all of his matches by ippon or waza-ari before losing to Gwak in the final, while statement 2 mentions that Hiraoka won the silver medal. However, these statements do not contradict each other as winning all matches by ippon or waza-ari does not necessarily guarantee a gold medal, as there are also bronze medals to be won. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
