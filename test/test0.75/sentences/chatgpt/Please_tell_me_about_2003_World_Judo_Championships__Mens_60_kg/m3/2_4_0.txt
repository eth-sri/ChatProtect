Statement 1 mentions that the bronze medals were won by Hiroshi Izumi from Japan and Ryan Reser from the United States, while Statement 2 mentions that the bronze medals were won by Ludwig Paischer from Austria and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon from France. These are two different sets of athletes, and therefore cannot both be true."
