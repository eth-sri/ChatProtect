  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Tadahiro Nomura from Japan won the gold medal, while Statement 2 says that Ludwig Paischer from Austria won the gold medal. Only one person can win the gold medal, so these statements cannot both be true."
