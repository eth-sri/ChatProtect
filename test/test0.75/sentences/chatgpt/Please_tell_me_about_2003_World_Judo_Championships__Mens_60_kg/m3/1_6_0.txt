  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about Hiraoka's performance in the competition, stating that he also won all of his matches by ippon or waza-ari before losing to Gwak in the final. Statement 2 simply states that Hiraoka was the silver medalist in the category, which is consistent with him losing to Gwak in the final and winning the silver medal."
