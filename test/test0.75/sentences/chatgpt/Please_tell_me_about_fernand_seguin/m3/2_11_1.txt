  "prefix": " Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian biologist, broadcaster, and filmmaker. He is best known for his pioneering work in radio and television broadcasting, as well as his contributions to the field of environmental science. Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied biology at the University of Montreal. He began his career in radio broadcasting in the 1940s, producing a variety of science-based programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In the 1960s, Seguin turned his attention to television, creating a groundbreaking science documentary series called \"La Nature et Les Hommes\" (Nature and Man). The series explored a wide range of environmental topics, from pollution and deforestation to wildlife conservation and sustainable agriculture. It was hugely popular with Canadian audiences and was syndicated internationally. Seguin's work in broadcasting helped to raise public awareness about environmental issues and to promote the importance of scientific research. He was also an active advocate for environmental conservation, working with organizations such as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund. In addition to his broadcasting work, Seguin was a prolific filmmaker, producing numerous documentaries on subjects ranging from astronomy to anthropology. He also wrote several books on science and technology.",
