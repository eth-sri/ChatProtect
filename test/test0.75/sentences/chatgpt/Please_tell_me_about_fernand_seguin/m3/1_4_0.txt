  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. While he began his career as a scientist at the National Research Council in Ottawa, where he conducted research on radioisotopes and their applications in medicine and agriculture, he also worked on the development of atomic energy in Canada. Additionally, he later worked as a professor of biochemistry at the University of Montreal. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
