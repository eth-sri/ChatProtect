  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he received a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master's degree, while Statement 2 says that he received a degree in medicine and a PhD in physiology. These are two different educational paths, and it is unlikely that he received both a Bachelor of Science degree and a degree in medicine. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
