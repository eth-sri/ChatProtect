He is best known for his pioneering work in radio and television broadcasting, as well as his contributions to the field of environmental science. Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied biology at the University of Montreal. He began his career in radio broadcasting in the 1940s, producing a variety of science-based programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In the 1960s, Seguin turned his attention to television, creating a groundbreaking science documentary series called \"La Nature et Les Hommes\" (Nature and Man). The series explored a wide range of environmental topics, from pollution and deforestation to wildlife conservation and sustainable agriculture. It was hugely popular with Canadian audiences and was syndicated internationally.",
