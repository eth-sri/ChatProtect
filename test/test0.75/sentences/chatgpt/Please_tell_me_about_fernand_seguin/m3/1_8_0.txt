The first statement highlights Seguin's commitment to environmental conservation, while the second statement emphasizes his role in popularizing science in Canada. Both statements can be true at the same time, as Seguin's work as a science broadcaster and writer often focused on environmental issues and the importance of preserving natural resources. In fact, his popular programs and articles likely helped raise public awareness and support for environmental conservation efforts."
