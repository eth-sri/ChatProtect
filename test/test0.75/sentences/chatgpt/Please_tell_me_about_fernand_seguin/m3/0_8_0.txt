  "prefix": " Fernand Seguin was a Canadian scientist, broadcaster, and educator who is best known for his contributions to the development of radio and television in Quebec and for his pioneering work in environmental studies. Born in Montreal in 1922, Seguin earned a degree in chemistry from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 1943 and went on to complete a PhD in biochemistry at McGill University in 1948. He began his career as a research scientist at the National Research Council of Canada, where he conducted groundbreaking research on the effects of radiation on living organisms. In the 1950s, Seguin turned his attention to broadcasting, and he became a fixture on Quebec radio and television. He hosted a popular science program called \"Le monde de la science\" (\"The World of Science\"), which ran for over 20 years and helped to popularize science in Quebec. Seguin was also an early advocate for environmentalism, and he played a key role in establishing the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Canadian Parks Service in the 1960s. He was a vocal proponent of conservation and sustainable development, and he worked to raise public awareness of environmental issues through his broadcasting and educational activities. Throughout his career, Seguin received numerous awards and honors, including the Order of Canada and the Prix du Qu\u00e9bec.",
