Statement 1 highlights his contributions to environmental science, while also acknowledging his work in broadcasting. Statement 2 focuses specifically on his work as a science broadcaster and his most well-known documentary series. Both statements are true and accurate, but they offer slightly different perspectives on Seguin's career."
