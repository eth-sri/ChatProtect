  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements mention that he hosted a popular science program, but they differ in the name of the program and the time period it aired. This suggests that Seguin had a successful career in broadcasting and was involved in multiple science programs throughout his career."
