Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied biology at the University of Montreal. He began his career in radio broadcasting in the 1940s, producing a variety of science-based programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In the 1960s, Seguin turned his attention to television, creating a groundbreaking science documentary series called \"La Nature et Les Hommes\" (Nature and Man). The series explored a wide range of environmental topics, from pollution and deforestation to wildlife conservation and sustainable agriculture. It was hugely popular with Canadian audiences and was syndicated internationally.
