Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied biology at the University of Montreal. He began his career in radio broadcasting in the 1940s, producing a variety of science-based programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).

The series explored a wide range of environmental topics, from pollution and deforestation to wildlife conservation and sustainable agriculture. It was hugely popular with Canadian audiences and was syndicated internationally. Seguin's work in broadcasting helped to raise public awareness about environmental issues and to promote the importance of scientific research. He was also an active advocate for environmental conservation, working with organizations such as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund.
