  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Statement 1 explains that the army was defeated by American forces and its commander, Yamashita, surrendered. Statement 2 adds further detail by stating that Yamashita was later tried and executed for war crimes. Both statements provide information about the ultimate fate of the Thirty-First Army and its commander, but from slightly different perspectives."
