  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the army was formed to defend the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines, while Statement 2 mentions that it was intended to defend the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies. These are two different regions, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
