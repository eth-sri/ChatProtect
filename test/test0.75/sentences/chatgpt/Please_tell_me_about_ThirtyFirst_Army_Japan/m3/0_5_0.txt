It was formed on November 3, 1944, and was primarily involved in the defense of the Japanese home islands against Allied forces. The Thirty-First Army was commanded by General Hisakazu Tanaka and was initially stationed on the island of Kyushu. In March 1945, as the Allies began their invasion of Okinawa, the Thirty-First Army was ordered to reinforce the island's defenses. The Thirty-First Army suffered heavy losses during the Battle of Okinawa, with many of its soldiers killed or injured in the fighting.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the army was disbanded after the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan in August 1945. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the context of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, while statement 2 does not."
