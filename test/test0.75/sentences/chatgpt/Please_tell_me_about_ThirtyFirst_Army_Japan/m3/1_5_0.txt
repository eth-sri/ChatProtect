The army consisted of two infantry divisions, the 77th and the 78th, and was intended to defend the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines against American forces. The Thirty-First Army was involved in several major battles during the Philippines Campaign, including the Battle of Leyte and the Battle of Luzon. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the army fought fiercely and inflicted heavy casualties on the American forces.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the army fought fiercely but was ultimately unable to stop the American advance, while the second statement states that the army was forced to surrender following Japan's official surrender to the Allied Powers. Both statements are consistent with the army's participation in the Philippines Campaign and its eventual defeat."
