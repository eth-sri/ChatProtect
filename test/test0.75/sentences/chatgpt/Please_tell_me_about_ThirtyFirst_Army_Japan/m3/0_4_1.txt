  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the heavy losses suffered by the army during the Battle of Okinawa, with many soldiers killed or injured. The only difference is that statement 2 provides a specific timeframe for the battle, which lasted from April to June 1945. Overall, both statements support the idea that the Thirty-First Army suffered significant losses during the war."
