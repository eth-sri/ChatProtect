The army was composed of several divisions, including the 14th, 22nd, and 100th divisions, and was tasked with defending the Philippines against American forces. The Thirty-First Army was involved in several major battles during the Philippines campaign, including the Battle of Leyte, Battle of Mindoro, and Battle of Luzon.

Statement 1 highlights the army's responsibility for the Manila massacre, while Statement 2 provides additional context by specifying that the massacre occurred during the Battle of Manila, which was fought between the Thirty-First Army and American forces. Both statements are consistent with the historical record and provide different perspectives on the army's actions during the Philippines campaign."
