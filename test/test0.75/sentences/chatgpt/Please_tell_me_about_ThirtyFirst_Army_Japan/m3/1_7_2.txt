  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on April 6, 1944, under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka. The army consisted of two infantry divisions, the 77th and the 78th, and was intended to defend the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines against American forces. The Thirty-First Army was involved in several major battles during the Philippines Campaign, including the Battle of Leyte and the Battle of Luzon. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the army fought fiercely and inflicted heavy casualties on the American forces. However, it was ultimately unable to halt the American advance and was forced to retreat. After the fall of Manila in February 1945, the Thirty-First Army was reorganized and was tasked with defending the mountains and jungles of northern Luzon.",
