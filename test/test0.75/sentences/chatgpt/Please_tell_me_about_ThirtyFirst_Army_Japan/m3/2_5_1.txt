It was formed on April 6, 1944, in the Philippines under the command of Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita. The army was composed of several divisions, including the 14th, 22nd, and 100th divisions, and was tasked with defending the Philippines against American forces. The Thirty-First Army was involved in several major battles during the Philippines campaign, including the Battle of Leyte, Battle of Mindoro, and Battle of Luzon. Despite initial successes, the army was eventually defeated by American forces in early 1945, and Yamashita surrendered on September 2 of that year.",
