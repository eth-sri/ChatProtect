  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"Please tell me about Corey Parker (actor)\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the AI language model is capable of providing information about Corey Parker (actor) but does not have personal opinions or beliefs about him. On the other hand, Statement 2 indicates that the AI language model does not have any information about Corey Parker (actor). These two statements cannot be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
