  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not necessarily contradictory, but they do present different aspects of the party's ideology. Statement 1 emphasizes the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection, while Statement 2 highlights the party's focus on environmentalism and social justice. These two principles are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for a political party to prioritize both sustainable development and environmental protection. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide different perspectives on the party's ideology."
