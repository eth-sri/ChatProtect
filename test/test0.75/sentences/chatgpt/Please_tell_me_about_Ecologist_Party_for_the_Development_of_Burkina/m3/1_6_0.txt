  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the party has not yet achieved significant electoral success, but has the potential to become a major player in the future. Statement 2 supports this idea by stating that the party has been gaining support among young people and environmental activists in Burkina Faso. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the party is still relatively new and has not yet made a significant impact on the political landscape, but has the potential to do so in the future."
