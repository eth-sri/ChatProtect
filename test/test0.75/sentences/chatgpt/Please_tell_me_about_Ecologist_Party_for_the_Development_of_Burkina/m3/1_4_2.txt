  "explanation": "The two statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that the party has not yet won any seats in the National Assembly of Burkina Faso, but it has been actively involved in local elections and gaining support among young people and environmental activists. The second statement reinforces this by stating that the party has been gaining popularity in recent years, particularly among young people and those concerned about the environment and social justice issues. Both statements suggest that the party is growing in popularity and support, but has not yet achieved significant political power."
