  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the party has not yet achieved significant electoral success, but suggests that it has the potential to become a major player in the future. Statement 2 supports this idea by noting that the party has been gaining support among young people and environmental activists, indicating that it may be building a strong base of support that could translate into electoral success in the future. Overall, both statements suggest that while the party is still relatively new and has not yet won any seats in the National Assembly, it is a party to watch in the coming years."
