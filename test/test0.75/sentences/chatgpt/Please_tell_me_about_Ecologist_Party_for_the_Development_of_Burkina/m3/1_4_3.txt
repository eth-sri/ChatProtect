  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Both statements mention the party's growing support among young people and environmental activists in Burkina Faso. The first statement simply adds that the party has not yet won any seats in the National Assembly, while the second statement emphasizes the party's popularity among young voters. Overall, both statements suggest that the PED-BF is a relatively new but promising political force in Burkina Faso, particularly among those concerned with environmental and social issues."
