The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (PEDB) is a political party in Burkina Faso. It was founded in 2014 by the former Minister of Environment in Burkina Faso, Salifou Sawadogo. Their aim is to promote sustainable development and environmental protection in Burkina Faso. They believe that socio-economic development can be achieved through the preservation of the environment and the rational use of natural resources. The party's manifesto includes policies on environmental protection, sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and waste management. They also advocate for the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of the rights of indigenous communities. In the 2020 presidential elections, the PEDB supported the candidacy of Z\u00e9phirin Diabr\u00e9, the leader of the Union for Progress and Change (UPC). However, Diabr\u00e9 lost to incumbent President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9.",
