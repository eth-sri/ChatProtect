  "prefix": " Gordon Gollob was a German fighter pilot during World War II. He was born on April 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria. He joined the Austrian Air Force in 1931 and later transferred to the German Luftwaffe in 1938. During the war, Gollob served in various fighter units and was known for his aggressive and skilled flying. He was credited with shooting down 150 enemy aircraft, making him one of the top fighter aces of the war. Gollob was also known for his controversial tactics, which included attacking enemy bombers head-on rather than from behind. He believed this was the most effective way to take down enemy planes, but it also put him and his own plane in great danger.",
