He flew with distinction in the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, and was credited with 150 aerial victories, making him one of the top-scoring pilots of the war. Gollob was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1912, and joined the military in 1933. He became a fighter pilot in 1936 and was posted to the Condor Legion, a German force sent to fight in the Spanish Civil War. During this conflict, Gollob shot down several enemy planes and gained valuable combat experience. When World War II broke out in 1939, Gollob was a seasoned fighter pilot and quickly rose through the ranks to become a squadron commander. He led his unit with skill and bravery, and his aggressive tactics earned him a reputation as a daring and effective fighter pilot.",
