Gollob was born in Vienna, Austria, and began his military career in the Austrian Air Force in 1934. When Austria was annexed by Germany in 1938, Gollob transferred to the Luftwaffe. During the war, Gollob flew the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and was known for his aggressive and deadly tactics. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military honor in Germany at the time, for his service.",

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Gollob was released in 1947, while statement 2 says that he was captured by the British in 1945 and spent several years as a prisoner of war. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
