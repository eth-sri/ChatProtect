  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Gollob was born in Vienna, Austria, and joined the military in 1933, while Statement 2 states that he joined the German Army in 1912 and later transferred to the Luftwaffe. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about Gollob's background and military career."
