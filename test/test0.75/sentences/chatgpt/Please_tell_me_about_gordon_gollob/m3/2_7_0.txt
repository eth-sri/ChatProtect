He was credited with 150 aerial victories, making him the fourth-highest-scoring pilot in the German Luftwaffe. Gollob was born in Vienna, Austria, and began his military career in the Austrian Air Force in 1934. When Austria was annexed by Germany in 1938, Gollob transferred to the Luftwaffe. During the war, Gollob flew the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and was known for his aggressive and deadly tactics. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military honor in Germany at the time, for his service. After the war, Gollob spent several years in British captivity before being released in 1947.",

While he did work as a journalist and author, writing about his experiences in the war, he also worked as a commercial pilot for Austrian Airlines after his release from captivity. These two statements do not conflict with each other and can both be true."
