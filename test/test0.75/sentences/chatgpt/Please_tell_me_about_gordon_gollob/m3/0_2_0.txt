  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he joined the Austrian Air Force in 1931 and later transferred to the German Luftwaffe in 1938, while statement 2 says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1933. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when and where Gollob joined the military."
