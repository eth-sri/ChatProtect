During the war, Gollob flew the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and was known for his aggressive and deadly tactics.

  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. They both state that Gollob spent several years in British captivity after the war and was released in 1947. The only difference is that Statement 2 is a repetition of the information provided in the text, while Statement 1 adds the detail that Gollob spent time in captivity after the war."
