Both statements mention that Joba is married to Param, but they provide different information about his background and personality. Statement 1 highlights the economic and social differences between Joba and Param, while Statement 2 emphasizes the supportive nature of their relationship. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of the show's characters and plot."
