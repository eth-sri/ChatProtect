  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. While both statements mention that the series is produced by Boyhood Productions and stars Biswajit Ghosh and Pallavi Sharma in lead roles, the second statement includes Ambarish Bhattacharya as a lead actor instead of Bishu Chakraborty mentioned in the first statement. This difference in the cast makes the statements contradictory."
