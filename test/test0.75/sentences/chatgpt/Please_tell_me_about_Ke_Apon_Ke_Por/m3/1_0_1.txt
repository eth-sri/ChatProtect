  "explanation": "The statements about \"Please tell me about Ke Apon Ke Por\" are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Ke Apon Ke Por is a Bengali television drama series that airs on Star Jalsha channel. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence. Statement 1 uses the series name as the subject of the sentence, while Statement 2 uses the channel name as the subject. However, both statements convey the same information and are not contradictory."
