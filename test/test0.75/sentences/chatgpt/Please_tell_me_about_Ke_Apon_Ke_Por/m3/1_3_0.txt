  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the show revolves around the life of Joba, but they describe her in different ways. Statement 1 describes Joba as a strong and independent woman who is married into a conservative family, while Statement 2 describes her as a simple and kind-hearted woman who faces various challenges in her life. These descriptions are not contradictory, but rather provide different perspectives on the character of Joba and the themes explored in the show."
