  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Ke Apon Ke Por is a popular Bengali television show. The only difference is that one statement refers to it as a \"serial\" while the other refers to it as a \"soap opera\". However, these terms are often used interchangeably to refer to a long-running television drama series. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
