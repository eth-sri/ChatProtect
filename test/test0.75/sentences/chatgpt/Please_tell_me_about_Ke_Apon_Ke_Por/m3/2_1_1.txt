  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the show has completed over 1000 episodes, while statement 2 claims that the show has completed over 800 episodes. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different numbers for the total episodes of the show. Therefore, they are contradictory."
