  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the same theme of the show, which is the struggles of women in a patriarchal society and the importance of standing up for oneself. The only difference is that statement 1 uses the term \"male-dominated society\" while statement 2 uses \"patriarchal societies\". However, both terms refer to the same societal structure where men hold more power and authority than women. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but rather complementary."
