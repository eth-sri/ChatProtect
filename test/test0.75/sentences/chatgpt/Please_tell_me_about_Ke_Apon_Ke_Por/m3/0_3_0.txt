  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not necessarily contradictory, but they present different perspectives on the main character, Joba. Statement 1 describes Joba as a strong and independent woman, while Statement 2 portrays her as a simple and kind-hearted woman who faces challenges. Both statements can be true at the same time, as Joba's strength and independence may be tested by the challenges she faces in her life. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
