  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. While he did become involved in controversy within the Anglican Church due to his preaching and support of the evangelical movement, he also became involved in philanthropic work, raising funds for the Bethesda Orphanage in Georgia and advocating for the abolition of slavery. These two aspects of his life are not mutually exclusive and can coexist."
