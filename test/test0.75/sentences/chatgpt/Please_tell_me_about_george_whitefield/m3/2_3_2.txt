  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both describe how Whitefield's preaching outside of the Anglican Church caused controversy and conflicts with church authorities. The first statement specifically mentions that he was denied permission to preach in some churches, while the second statement more generally describes conflicts with church authorities. However, both statements support the idea that Whitefield's actions were seen as controversial by some within the Anglican Church."
