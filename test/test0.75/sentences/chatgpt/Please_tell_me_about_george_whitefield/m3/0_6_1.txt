He is considered one of the most influential figures of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept across the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was ordained as a deacon in 1736 and began preaching in the American colonies in 1739. He was known for his powerful oratory skills and his ability to captivate large crowds with his sermons. He traveled extensively throughout the colonies, preaching to thousands of people in open fields and public spaces.

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. While he believed in the concept of predestination, he also emphasized the importance of personal choice and repentance. This means that while God may have already chosen who will be saved, individuals still have the ability to choose to accept salvation through repentance. Additionally, Whitefield taught that God will not force anyone to accept salvation, further emphasizing the importance of personal choice. Therefore, both statements are consistent with Whitefield's teachings."
