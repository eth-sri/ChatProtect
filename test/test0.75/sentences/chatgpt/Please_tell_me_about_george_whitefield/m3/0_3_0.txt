They both highlight his ability to deliver powerful and captivating sermons that drew large crowds and inspired many to convert to Christianity. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes his oratory skills, while statement 2 emphasizes the emotional impact of his sermons. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea about Whitefield's preaching style and its impact on his audience."
