  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. While he did face controversy and denial of permission to preach in some churches due to his involvement in the evangelical movement and preaching outside of the Anglican Church, he also had a close friendship with Benjamin Franklin and worked with him to establish an orphanage in Georgia. These two statements provide different aspects of Whitefield's life and do not contradict each other."
