  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican minister and one of the most influential preachers of the Great Awakening, a religious movement that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was ordained as a minister in 1736. Whitefield quickly gained a reputation as a powerful and engaging speaker, drawing large crowds wherever he preached. He became deeply involved in the evangelical movement and began preaching outside of the Anglican Church, which caused controversy and led to him being denied permission to preach in some churches. In 1739, Whitefield traveled to America for the first time to preach, and he would go on to make several more trips to the colonies throughout his life. His preaching had a profound impact on the people of the colonies, and many credit him with helping to spark the religious revival of the Great Awakening. Whitefield was also known for his philanthropy, and he founded an orphanage in Georgia that cared for hundreds of children.",
