  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was ordained as a deacon in 1736, but they provide different information about what he did after his ordination. Statement 1 states that he began preaching in the American colonies in 1739, while Statement 2 simply mentions that he was ordained in the Church of England. Therefore, the statements are complementary and provide different pieces of information about Whitefield's life."
