  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his significant role in the Great Awakening, a religious revival movement that occurred in both Britain and the American colonies during the 18th century. The only difference between the two statements is that one emphasizes his influence in America, while the other emphasizes his influence in Britain."
