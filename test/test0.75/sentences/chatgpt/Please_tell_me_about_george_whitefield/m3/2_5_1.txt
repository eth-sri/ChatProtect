  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican minister and one of the most influential preachers of the Great Awakening, a religious movement that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was ordained as a minister in 1736. Whitefield quickly gained a reputation as a powerful and engaging speaker, drawing large crowds wherever he preached. He became deeply involved in the evangelical movement and began preaching outside of the Anglican Church, which caused controversy and led to him being denied permission to preach in some churches. In 1739, Whitefield traveled to America for the first time to preach, and he would go on to make several more trips to the colonies throughout his life.",
