  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican cleric and evangelist who was born on December 16, 1714, in Gloucester, England. He is considered one of the most influential figures of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept across the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was ordained as a deacon in 1736 and began preaching in the American colonies in 1739. He was known for his powerful oratory skills and his ability to captivate large crowds with his sermons. He traveled extensively throughout the colonies, preaching to thousands of people in open fields and public spaces. Whitefield's message focused on the need for personal salvation and the importance of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.",

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about George Whitefield are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Whitefield believed in both predestination and personal choice, while Statement 2 suggests that he only believed in predestination and spreading the message of salvation. These two beliefs cannot coexist, as predestination implies that personal choice is irrelevant in determining one's salvation."
