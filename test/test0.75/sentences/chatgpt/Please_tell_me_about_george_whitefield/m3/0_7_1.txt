  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican cleric and evangelist who was born on December 16, 1714, in Gloucester, England. He is considered one of the most influential figures of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept across the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was ordained as a deacon in 1736 and began preaching in the American colonies in 1739. He was known for his powerful oratory skills and his ability to captivate large crowds with his sermons. He traveled extensively throughout the colonies, preaching to thousands of people in open fields and public spaces. Whitefield's message focused on the need for personal salvation and the importance of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. He believed in the idea of predestination, which holds that God has already chosen who will be saved and who will not, but he also emphasized the importance of personal choice and repentance.",
