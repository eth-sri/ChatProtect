He was born in Gloucester, England in 1714 and was educated at Oxford University. Whitefield became known for his powerful preaching style and ability to draw large crowds. He traveled extensively throughout the American colonies, preaching to thousands of people in open-air meetings. He also founded several schools and orphanages in America. Whitefield was known for his evangelical views and his belief in the necessity of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. He became involved in controversy in the Anglican Church due to his preaching and his support of the evangelical movement.

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his lasting impact on the development of evangelical Christianity and the evangelical movement in America. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions the impact on Christianity as a whole, while statement 1 focuses on the impact on evangelical Christianity. However, both statements are consistent in recognizing Whitefield's significant influence on American religion."
