  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are not necessarily contradictory, as they both provide different aspects of his political career and reputation. Statement 1 highlights his political alignment and loyalty to President Erdo\u011fan, while Statement 2 emphasizes his expertise in economics and his efforts to improve Turkey's economy. These statements can coexist and complement each other, as Elvan's political views and support for the president may have influenced his appointment to the position of Minister of Finance and Treasury, where his economic expertise is now being put to use."
