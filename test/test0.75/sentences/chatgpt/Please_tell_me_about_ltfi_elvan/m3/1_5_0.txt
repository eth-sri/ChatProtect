  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Elvan was appointed as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in February 2021, while Statement 2 says that he was appointed on November 10, 2020. These two dates cannot both be correct, so the statements contradict each other."
