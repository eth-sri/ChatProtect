  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his current role as the Minister of Finance and Treasury and the challenges he faces in managing Turkey's struggling economy, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"further\" in the second statement, which suggests that the pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing economic issues in Turkey. However, this does not contradict the information provided in the first statement."
