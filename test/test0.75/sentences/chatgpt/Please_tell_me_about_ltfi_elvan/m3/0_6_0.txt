  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are not contradictory. They both mention his return to Turkish politics, but in different years and in different capacities. Statement 1 mentions his return as a member of parliament for Istanbul province in 2018, while Statement 2 mentions his return as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in 2021. Therefore, the statements provide complementary information about Elvan's political career."
