  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 states that he began his political career in 2002, while Statement 2 states that he began his political career as a member of the AKP and was elected as an MP in 2015. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when Elvan started his political career."
