  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Elvan began his political career in 2002 as a member of parliament for the AKP representing Ayd\u0131n province, while statement 2 claims that he began his political career in 2015 as a member of parliament for the AKP representing Konya province. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the start of Elvan's political career."
