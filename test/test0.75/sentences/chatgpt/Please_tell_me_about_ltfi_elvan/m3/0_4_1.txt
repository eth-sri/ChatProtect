Both statements mention that he served as the Minister of Development between 2013 and 2015 and oversaw the implementation of several infrastructure projects in Turkey, including the Marmaray rail tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions the Marmaray rail tunnel, while statement 2 is more general in its description of the infrastructure projects."
