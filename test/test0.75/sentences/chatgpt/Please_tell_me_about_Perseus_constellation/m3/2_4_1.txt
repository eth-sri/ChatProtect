  "orig": "Perseus also includes a number of interesting deep-sky objects, including the Double Cluster, a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye and located near the border with Cassiopeia.",
  "alt": "A pair of open star clusters, NGC 869 and NGC 884, are located in the constellation of Perseus.",
  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD and is part of the Perseus family of constellations, which includes Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus. Perseus is most famous for its brightest star, the variable star Algol, which is located at the head of the constellation. Algol is known as the \"Demon Star\" because of its erratic behavior; it dims and brightens every few days due to an eclipsing binary system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically pass in front of each other.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention open star clusters located in the constellation of Perseus. The first statement specifically mentions the Double Cluster, while the second statement mentions NGC 869 and NGC 884. These are different open star clusters, but they are both located in the constellation of Perseus. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
