  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the same mythological story of Perseus slaying the Gorgon Medusa, but they use slightly different wording. Statement 1 mentions that Perseus was known for this feat, while Statement 2 describes Perseus as the hero who accomplished it. However, both statements convey the same information and do not contradict each other."
