  "orig": "The constellation also contains the California Nebula, a large emission nebula that glows red due to ionized hydrogen gas, and the Perseus Molecular Cloud, a region of gas and dust where new stars are forming.",
  "alt": "In the constellation of Perseus, new stars are forming within the Perseus Molecular Cloud, a large cloud of gas and dust that is a site of active star formation.",
  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD and is part of the Perseus family of constellations, which includes Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus. Perseus is most famous for its brightest star, the variable star Algol, which is located at the head of the constellation. Algol is known as the \"Demon Star\" because of its erratic behavior; it dims and brightens every few days due to an eclipsing binary system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically pass in front of each other. Perseus also includes a number of interesting deep-sky objects, including the Double Cluster, a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye and located near the border with Cassiopeia.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the Perseus Molecular Cloud, a region of gas and dust where new stars are forming. The first statement also mentions the California Nebula, while the second statement emphasizes that the Perseus Molecular Cloud is a site of active star formation. Both statements provide additional information about the constellation of Perseus and its interesting deep-sky objects."
