  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD and is part of the Perseus family of constellations, which includes Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus. Perseus is most famous for its brightest star, the variable star Algol, which is located at the head of the constellation. Algol is known as the \"Demon Star\" because of its erratic behavior; it dims and brightens every few days due to an eclipsing binary system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically pass in front of each other.",
