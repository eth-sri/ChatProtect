  "prefix": " Perseus is a northern constellation that is named after the hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness. Algol is actually a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically eclipse each other, causing the brightness to fluctuate. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, which is a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about a specific deep-sky object, the Double Cluster, that can be seen in Perseus with the naked eye. Statement 2 also mentions the Double Cluster as a notable deep-sky object in Perseus. Both statements are consistent with the information provided in the beginning of the text about Perseus containing several deep-sky objects."
