It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD and is part of the Perseus family of constellations, which includes Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus.

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory, but rather provide different explanations for why Algol is known as the \"Demon Star\". Statement 1 explains that Algol's variability is due to an eclipsing binary system, while statement 2 suggests that its historical association with evil is the reason for its nickname. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
