Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Algol in the Perseus constellation are not contradictory. They both describe Algol as a binary star system consisting of two stars that orbit each other and cause the brightness to fluctuate. The only difference is that statement 2 provides additional information about the stars orbiting around a common center of mass. Therefore, the statements are complementary and not contradictory."
