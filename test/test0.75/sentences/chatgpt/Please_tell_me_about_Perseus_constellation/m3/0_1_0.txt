  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory, but statement 2 includes an additional constellation, Pegasus, that is not mentioned in statement 1. Both statements mention the same three constellations that are located near Perseus: Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. However, statement 2 expands on this by including Pegasus as another nearby constellation."
