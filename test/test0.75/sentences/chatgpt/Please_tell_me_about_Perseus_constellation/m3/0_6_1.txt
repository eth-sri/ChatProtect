  "prefix": " Perseus is a northern constellation that is named after the hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness. Algol is actually a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically eclipse each other, causing the brightness to fluctuate. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, which is a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away.",

They both provide additional information about the constellation, specifically about open star clusters that can be seen with the naked eye. The first statement mentions the Double Cluster, while the second statement mentions NGC 869 and NGC 884. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
