The constellation is easily recognizable because of its prominent shape, which resembles a \"W\" or \"M\" depending on its orientation in the sky. Perseus is home to several notable astronomical objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known for its dramatic changes in brightness. It also contains a number of open star clusters, such as NGC 884 and NGC 869, which are popular targets for amateur astronomers.",
