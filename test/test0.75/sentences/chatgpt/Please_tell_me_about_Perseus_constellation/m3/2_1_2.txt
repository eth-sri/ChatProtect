Statement 1 specifically mentions that Perseus is part of the Perseus family of constellations, while also naming some of the other constellations in that family. Statement 2 reiterates that the Perseus family includes Andromeda and Cassiopeia. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information."
