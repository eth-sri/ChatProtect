  "explanation": "The two statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about the constellation's relationship with other constellations in the Perseus family and its cataloguing by Ptolemy, while Statement 2 simply states that Perseus is one of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy. Both statements provide different but complementary information about the constellation."
