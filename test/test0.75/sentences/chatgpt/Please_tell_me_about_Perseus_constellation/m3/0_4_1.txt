  "orig": "Algol is actually a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically eclipse each other, causing the brightness to fluctuate.",
  "alt": "Two stars in Perseus, named V432 Persei and V471 Tauri, orbit around each other in a binary system.",
  "prefix": " Perseus is a northern constellation that is named after the hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements describe binary star systems within the constellation, but they refer to different stars. Statement 1 refers to Algol, which is a well-known binary star system in Perseus, while Statement 2 refers to a different binary system involving V432 Persei and V471 Tauri. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
