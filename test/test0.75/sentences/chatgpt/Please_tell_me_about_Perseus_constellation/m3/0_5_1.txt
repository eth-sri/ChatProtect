  "prefix": " Perseus is a northern constellation that is named after the hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness. Algol is actually a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically eclipse each other, causing the brightness to fluctuate.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. They both mention the Perseus Cluster, a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away from Earth, as a notable feature of the constellation. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that Perseus contains several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, while statement 2 specifically identifies the Perseus Cluster as a feature of the constellation."
