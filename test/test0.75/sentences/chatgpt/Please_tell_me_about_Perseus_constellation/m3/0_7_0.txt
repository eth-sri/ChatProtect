  "orig": "In Greek mythology, Perseus was a hero who slayed the Gorgon Medusa and rescued Andromeda from a sea monster.",
  "alt": "Perseus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy.",
  "prefix": " Perseus is a northern constellation that is named after the hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness. Algol is actually a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically eclipse each other, causing the brightness to fluctuate. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, which is a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away. Additionally, the Double Cluster is a beautiful pair of open star clusters that can be seen with the naked eye.",

The first statement provides information about the mythological figure Perseus, after whom the constellation is named, while the second statement provides information about the constellation's inclusion in Ptolemy's list of constellations. Both statements provide different but complementary information about Perseus (constellation)."
