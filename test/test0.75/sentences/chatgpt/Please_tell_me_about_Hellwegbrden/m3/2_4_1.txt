  "explanation": "The statements about Hellwegb\u00f6rden are not contradictory, but rather complement each other. Statement 1 mentions evidence of human settlement dating back to the Neolithic period, which is a later period than the Stone Age. Statement 2 adds to this by specifying that evidence of human settlement has been found even earlier, in the Stone Age. Therefore, both statements provide different but compatible information about the region's history of human settlement."
