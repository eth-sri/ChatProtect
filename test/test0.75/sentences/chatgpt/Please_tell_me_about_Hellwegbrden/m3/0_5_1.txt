Both statements mention evidence of human settlement dating back to different periods, but they do not contradict each other. The first statement mentions settlement dating back to the Stone Age, while the second statement specifies settlement dating back to the Neolithic period, which is a more specific time frame within the Stone Age. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the region's long history of human settlement."
