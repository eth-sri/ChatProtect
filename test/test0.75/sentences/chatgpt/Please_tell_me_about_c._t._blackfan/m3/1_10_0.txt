  "prefix": " C.T. Blackfan, also known as Cecil Thomas Blackfan, was a prominent American physician and pediatrician who is best known for his research on anemia in infants and children. He was born on June 6, 1882, in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1909. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. He conducted extensive studies on the use of liver extracts in treating anemia, which led to the development of liver therapy as a standard treatment for the condition. He also conducted research on the use of oxygen therapy and blood transfusions in treating anemia. Blackfan was a highly respected figure in the field of pediatrics and served as the director of the pediatric department at Boston Children's Hospital from 1930 to 1952. He was also a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School from 1928 until his retirement in 1952. In addition to his research on anemia, Blackfan made significant contributions to the field of pediatric infectious diseases and served as an important advisor to the US government during World War II on matters related to child health.
