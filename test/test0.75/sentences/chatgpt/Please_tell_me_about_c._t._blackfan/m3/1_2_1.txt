  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1909, while statement 2 says that he received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1917. These two statements cannot both be true, as Harvard Medical School did not exist until 1908, and therefore could not have awarded Blackfan a degree in 1909."
