Statement 1 mentions his significant contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, while Statement 2 describes the genetic disorder Blackfan discovered, Blackfan-Diamond anemia, which affects the bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells. Both statements provide additional information about Blackfan's research on different types of anemia."
