He was born on June 6, 1882, in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1909. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. He conducted extensive studies on the use of liver extracts in treating anemia, which led to the development of liver therapy as a standard treatment for the condition. He also conducted research on the use of oxygen therapy and blood transfusions in treating anemia. Blackfan was a highly respected figure in the field of pediatrics and served as the director of the pediatric department at Boston Children's Hospital from 1930 to 1952.",
