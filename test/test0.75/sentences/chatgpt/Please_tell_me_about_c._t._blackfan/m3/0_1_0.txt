  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about C. T. Blackfan are contradictory. The first statement states that he was born on December 26, 1883, while the second statement states that he was born on August 14, 1883. Since the two statements provide different dates of birth for C. T. Blackfan, they cannot both be true at the same time."
