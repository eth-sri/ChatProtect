Both statements refer to his discovery of Blackfan-Diamond anemia, with statement 1 specifying that it is a rare genetic disorder affecting the bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells, and statement 2 specifying that Blackfan discovered the genetic basis of the anemia. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about Blackfan's contributions to the field of hematology."
