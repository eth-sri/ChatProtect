  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements mention his prominence as an American physician and pediatrician, and his work on anemia in infants and children. The only difference is in the specific focus of his research, with statement 1 mentioning his research on anemia and statement 2 mentioning his work on the treatment of anemia. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of C.T. Blackfan as a significant figure in the field of pediatrics and an expert on anemia in infants."
