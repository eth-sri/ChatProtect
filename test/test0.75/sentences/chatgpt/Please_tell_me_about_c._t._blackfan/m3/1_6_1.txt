Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. He conducted extensive studies on the use of liver extracts in treating anemia, which led to the development of liver therapy as a standard treatment for the condition.
