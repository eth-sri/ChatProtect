  "prefix": " C.T. Blackfan was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He was born on January 30, 1882, in Boston, Massachusetts, and died on May 31, 1941. Blackfan earned his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908 and completed his residency at Boston Children's Hospital. He then joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School and became the chief of the Hematology Division at Boston Children's Hospital. Blackfan is best known for his research on anemia, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. He discovered a form of anemia called Blackfan-Diamond anemia, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells. He also made significant contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become misshapen and break down. In addition to his research, Blackfan was an excellent teacher and mentor to many students and residents.",
