  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements relate to Blackfan's work on different types of anemia. The first statement refers to his discovery of Blackfan-Diamond anemia, while the second statement highlights his work on thalassemia. Both are genetic disorders that affect the production of red blood cells and are related to anemia. Therefore, the statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
