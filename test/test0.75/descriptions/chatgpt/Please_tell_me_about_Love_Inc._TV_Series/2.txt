The show revolves around a group of dating consultants who work for a company called Love, Inc. The company's founder, Denise Johnson (played by Busy Philipps), is a former dating consultant who now runs the company and oversees her team of quirky employees.\n\nThe main character is Clea, played by Holly Robinson Peete, who is the team's lead dating consultant. Other members of the team include Francine (played by Reagan Gomez-Preston), a former client of the company who is now a consultant, and Barry (played by Vince Vieluf), a quirky and enthusiastic member of the team.\n\nThe show follows the team as they help clients navigate the world of dating and find love. Each episode features a new client with a unique set of dating problems, and the team works together to come up with solutions. Along the way, the team members also deal with their own romantic and personal struggles.\n\nDespite positive reviews, Love, Inc. was cancelled after one season due to low ratings. However, it has since gained a cult following and is considered a hidden gem of early 2000s television.",
