  "text": "Gordon Gollob (1912-1987) was a German fighter pilot during World War II. He flew with distinction in the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, and was credited with 150 aerial victories, making him one of the top-scoring pilots of the war.\n\nGollob was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1912, and joined the military in 1933. He became a fighter pilot in 1936 and was posted to the Condor Legion, a German force sent to fight in the Spanish Civil War. During this conflict, Gollob shot down several enemy planes and gained valuable combat experience.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939, Gollob was a seasoned fighter pilot and quickly rose through the ranks to become a squadron commander. He led his unit with skill and bravery, and his aggressive tactics earned him a reputation as a daring and effective fighter pilot.\n\nGollob's success continued throughout the war, and he was credited with shooting down 150 Allied aircraft in total. He was awarded numerous honors and decorations for his bravery in combat, including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military award in Nazi Germany.\n\nAfter the war, Gollob was held as a prisoner of war by the Allies for several years before being released in 1947. He later worked as a sales representative for an Austrian automotive company and died in 1987 at the age of 75.",
