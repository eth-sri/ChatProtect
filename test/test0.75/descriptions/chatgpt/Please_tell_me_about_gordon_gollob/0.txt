  "text": "Gordon Gollob was a German fighter pilot during World War II. He was born on April 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria. He joined the Austrian Air Force in 1931 and later transferred to the German Luftwaffe in 1938.\n\nDuring the war, Gollob served in various fighter units and was known for his aggressive and skilled flying. He was credited with shooting down 150 enemy aircraft, making him one of the top fighter aces of the war.\n\nGollob was also known for his controversial tactics, which included attacking enemy bombers head-on rather than from behind. He believed this was the most effective way to take down enemy planes, but it also put him and his own plane in great danger.\n\nAfter the war, Gollob was captured by the Allies and spent several years in prison before being released in 1948. He later worked as a test pilot for Messerschmitt and then for the West German Air Force.\n\nGollob passed away on September 7, 1987, in Salzburg, Austria, at the age of 75.",
