  "text": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style that emerged in the late 19th century in England. It was a reaction against the mass-produced goods of the Industrial Revolution and emphasized traditional craftsmanship and materials. \n\nThe style is characterized by its use of natural materials, such as stone, brick, and wood, and its attention to detail. Common features include asymmetrical facades, steeply pitched roofs, and decorative elements such as stained glass windows, intricate woodwork, and decorative tiles. \n\nThe movement was led by figures such as William Morris, who believed that art and beauty should be accessible to all, not just the wealthy. Morris founded the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. design firm, which produced a range of decorative objects, furniture, and textiles in the Arts and Crafts style. \n\nSome notable examples of English Arts and Crafts architecture include Red House, built for Morris in 1859, and the Blackwell Arts and Crafts House, designed by Baillie Scott in 1898. The style also influenced architecture in other countries, including the United States, where it became known as the Craftsman style.",
