  "text": "English Arts and Crafts architecture was a movement that flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in England. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made objects of the Industrial Revolution and the ornate, over-decorated styles of the Victorian era. The Arts and Crafts movement sought to revive traditional crafts and techniques, emphasizing simplicity, quality, and functionality.\n\nThe architecture of the Arts and Crafts movement was characterized by a focus on handcrafted details, natural materials, and an integration with the surrounding landscape. The movement was influenced by the medieval architecture of England and the Arts and Crafts movement in Europe.\n\nHouses built in the English Arts and Crafts style often feature steeply pitched roofs, asymmetrical facades, and handcrafted details such as decorative brackets, exposed beams, and carved woodwork. The interiors of these homes often include open floor plans, built-in cabinetry, and natural materials such as stone and wood.\n\nProminent architects associated with the English Arts and Crafts movement include Charles Rennie Mackintosh, C.F.A. Voysey, and William Morris. The movement also had a profound influence on the development of modern architecture, particularly in the use of natural materials, simplicity of design, and emphasis on function over ornamentation.",
