He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.\n\nCl\u00e9singer was a member of the Barbizon school of landscape painters, and he was also associated with the Realist movement in sculpture. He was influenced by the work of Michelangelo, and his sculptures often depicted naturalistic scenes of everyday life.\n\nOne of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its erotic content. The sculpture depicts a naked woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast.\n\nIn addition to his sculptural work, Cl\u00e9singer was also a painter and illustrator. He was married to the writer George Sand, and the couple had two children together. Cl\u00e9singer died in Paris in 1883.",
