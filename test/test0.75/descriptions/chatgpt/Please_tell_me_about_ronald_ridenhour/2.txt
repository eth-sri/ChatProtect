He wrote letters to government officials, including the President of the United States, detailing what he had heard. His letters eventually led to a full investigation and the prosecution of several soldiers involved in the massacre.\n\nRidenhour received numerous awards for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, including the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award and the Ridenhour Courage Prize, named in his honor. He continued to be an advocate for peace and justice throughout his life, and died in 1998 at the age of 52.",
