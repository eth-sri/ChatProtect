  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the mythical hero Perseus, who was known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is easily recognizable because of its prominent shape, which resembles a \"W\" or \"M\" depending on its orientation in the sky.\n\nPerseus is home to several notable astronomical objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known for its dramatic changes in brightness. It also contains a number of open star clusters, such as NGC 884 and NGC 869, which are popular targets for amateur astronomers.\n\nIn addition to its astronomical significance, Perseus has played an important role in human history and mythology. It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD and has since been referenced in a variety of cultural works, including Dante's Divine Comedy and the Percy Jackson series of novels.",
