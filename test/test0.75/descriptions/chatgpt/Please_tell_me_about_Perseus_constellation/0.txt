  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a northern constellation that is named after the hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is best visible in the northern hemisphere during winter months.\n\nPerseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"demon star\" because of its variable brightness. Algol is actually a binary star system, where two stars orbit each other and periodically eclipse each other, causing the brightness to fluctuate.\n\nPerseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, which is a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away. Additionally, the Double Cluster is a beautiful pair of open star clusters that can be seen with the naked eye.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Perseus was a hero who slayed the Gorgon Medusa and rescued Andromeda from a sea monster. The constellation is depicted holding the head of Medusa in one hand and a sword in the other.",
