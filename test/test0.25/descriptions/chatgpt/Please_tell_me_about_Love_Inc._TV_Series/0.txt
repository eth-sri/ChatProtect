She is joined by her colleagues, including the charming and suave Clea, played by Holly Robinson Peete, and the nerdy and lovable Barry, played by Vince Vieluf.\n\nThroughout the series, the consultants deal with a variety of clients, from the shy and awkward to the overly confident and demanding. They also navigate their own romantic relationships, with Denise struggling to balance her career and her love life, and Clea dealing with the aftermath of a messy divorce.\n\nDespite positive reviews from critics, Love, Inc. was cancelled after one season due to low ratings. However, it has since gained a cult following and is remembered for its witty writing and charming cast.",
