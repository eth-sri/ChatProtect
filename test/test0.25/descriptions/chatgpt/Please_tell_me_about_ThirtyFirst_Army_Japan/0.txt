  "text": "The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on July 9, 1944, under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka and was primarily responsible for the defense of the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines.\n\nThe Thirty-First Army was composed of approximately 80,000 troops, including both Japanese and Filipino soldiers. Its main units included the 10th Independent Mixed Brigade, the 102nd Division, and the 103rd Division.\n\nIn October 1944, the Thirty-First Army fought in the Battle of Leyte, where it faced off against American forces led by General Douglas MacArthur. Despite putting up a fierce resistance, the Japanese were eventually defeated, and the Thirty-First Army suffered heavy losses.\n\nAfter the Battle of Leyte, the Thirty-First Army was reorganized and sent to defend the island of Luzon. However, it was unable to stop the advance of American forces, and in February 1945, the army was forced to retreat to the mountains.\n\nThe Thirty-First Army continued to fight a guerrilla war against American forces until the end of the war in August 1945. Many of its soldiers were killed or captured, while others went into hiding and continued to fight for several years after the war ended.",
