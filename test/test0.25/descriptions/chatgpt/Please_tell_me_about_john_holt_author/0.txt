  "text": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that traditional schooling was often ineffective and harmful to children's natural curiosity and love of learning. \n\nHolt was a teacher himself, but became disillusioned with the education system and began writing about his ideas for reform. His first book, \"How Children Fail,\" published in 1964, criticized the traditional approach to education and argued that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and discover on their own. \n\nHolt went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Teach Your Own.\" He also founded the magazine \"Growing Without Schooling,\" which provided resources and support for homeschooling families. \n\nHolt's ideas have had a significant impact on the homeschooling and unschooling movements, and his work continues to be influential today.",
