  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is easily recognizable due to its distinctive shape, which resembles a \"W\" or \"M\" depending on the orientation.\n\nPerseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"Demon Star\" due to its variable brightness. It also contains several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster located approximately 250 million light-years away.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danae. He was tasked with slaying the Gorgon Medusa, whose gaze could turn people to stone. With the help of Athena and Hermes, Perseus was able to defeat Medusa by using a mirrored shield to avoid her gaze and cutting off her head with a sword.\n\nThe constellation Perseus is visible from the northern hemisphere from August to March. It is located between the constellations Cassiopeia and Taurus.",
