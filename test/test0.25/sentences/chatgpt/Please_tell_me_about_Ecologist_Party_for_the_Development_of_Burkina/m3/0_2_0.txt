  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the leadership of the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina Faso (PED-BF) are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the party is led by its founder, Ram Ou\u00e9draogo, while statement 2 claims that the party is led by its founder, Arouna Ou\u00e9draogo. As both statements cannot be true at the same time, they are contradictory."
