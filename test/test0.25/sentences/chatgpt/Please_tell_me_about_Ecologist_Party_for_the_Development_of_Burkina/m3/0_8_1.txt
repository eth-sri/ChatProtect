  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the party has not yet won any seats in the National Assembly, but has gained support from environmental activists and young people in the country through its participation in local elections. Statement 2 confirms that the party has limited representation in the National Assembly, which is consistent with the fact that it has not yet won any seats. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the party's current political status in Burkina Faso."
