Statement 1 mentions the party's lack of success in winning a significant number of seats in the National Assembly, while Statement 2 refers to the country of Burkina Faso as a whole, not specifically the PED-B, and its lack of success in winning a presidential election. Therefore, the two statements are not in conflict with each other."
