Both statements mention that the party has not yet won any seats in the National Assembly of Burkina Faso. The only difference is that the first statement adds that the party has participated in several national elections, while the second statement simply states that the party has not won any seats in the elections. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
