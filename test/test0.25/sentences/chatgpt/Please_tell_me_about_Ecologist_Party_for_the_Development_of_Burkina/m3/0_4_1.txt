  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the party has not won any seats in the National Assembly, while statement 2 suggests that the party won one seat in the 2020 elections. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that the party did not win any seats in previous elections but managed to win one seat in the most recent election. Alternatively, there may be some confusion or error in the information provided."
