  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the show's popularity among Bengali audiences and its status as one of the most popular television dramas in the region. The only difference is in the phrasing of the second statement, which uses \"become a huge following\" instead of \"gained a huge following.\" However, this difference in phrasing does not change the overall meaning of the statement."
