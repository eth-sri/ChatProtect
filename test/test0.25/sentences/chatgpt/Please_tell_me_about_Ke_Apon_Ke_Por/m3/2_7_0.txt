While the text focuses on the story and characters of the show, the two statements provide additional information about the relationship between Joba and Param, who are the main characters. The first statement highlights their strong bond and support for each other, while the second statement adds that they have two children together. Both statements are consistent with the portrayal of Joba and Param's relationship in the show."
