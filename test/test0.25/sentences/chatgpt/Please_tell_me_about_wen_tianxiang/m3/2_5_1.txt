  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory, but rather provide different pieces of information about his capture by the Mongols. Statement 1 indicates that he was captured in 1278 and eventually executed, while Statement 2 notes that he was taken captive after the fall of the Song Dynasty in 1279. These statements can be reconciled by understanding that Wen Tianxiang was captured before the fall of the Song Dynasty, but was not executed until after its collapse."
