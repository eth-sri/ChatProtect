  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. They both mention his demotion, but provide different reasons for it. Statement 1 states that he was accused of treason by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, while statement 2 suggests that he was demoted for his criticism of the government's handling of the war against the Mongols. These two reasons could potentially be related, as his criticism may have been seen as disloyal by the ruling dynasty. However, the statements do not directly contradict each other."
