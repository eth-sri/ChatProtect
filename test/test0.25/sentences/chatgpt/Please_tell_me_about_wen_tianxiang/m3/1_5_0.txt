  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Wen Tianxiang was successful in leading the Song army against the Mongols, while Statement 2 suggests that he was appointed as the Minister of War to lead the resistance against the Mongol invasion. However, the text does not mention Wen Tianxiang being appointed as the Minister of War, but rather mentions his appointment to various government positions, including the governorship of Jiangxi Province. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is accurate."
