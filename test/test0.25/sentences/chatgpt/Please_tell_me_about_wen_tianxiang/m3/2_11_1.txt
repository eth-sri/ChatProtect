  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song dynasty. He is best known for his heroic resistance against the Mongol invasion and his unwavering loyalty to the Song dynasty. Wen Tianxiang was born in Haining, Zhejiang province, and was educated in Confucian classics and military strategy. He served as a military officer and later as a high-ranking official in the Song government. In 1275, he was appointed as the chief minister of the Southern Song dynasty. In 1276, the Mongol army led by Kublai Khan invaded the Song dynasty and captured the capital city of Lin'an (modern-day Hangzhou). Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender and instead fled to the mountains, where he continued to resist the Mongol invasion. Wen Tianxiang wrote a famous poem called \"Song of Righteousness\" (also known as \"Song of the Loyalty and Righteousness\") in which he expressed his loyalty to the Song dynasty and his determination to fight against the Mongol invaders. The poem became a symbol of resistance against foreign aggression and a source of inspiration for later generations. Wen Tianxiang was eventually captured by the Mongols and was executed in 1283. He is remembered as a national hero and a symbol of loyalty and patriotism in Chinese history.",

Both statements mention his statue being present in many cities in China, with the second statement specifying Hangzhou and Haining. The first statement also mentions his legacy being celebrated in literature, art, and popular culture, which is not contradictory to the second statement."
