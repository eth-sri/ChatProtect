  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song Dynasty. He is best known for his role in resisting the Mongol invasion of China and for his literary works. Wen Tianxiang was born into a family of scholars and officials in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. He began his career as a scholar and was appointed to various government positions, including the governorship of Jiangxi Province. In 1278, the Mongol Empire launched a massive invasion of Southern Song Dynasty, which had been weakened by internal strife and corruption. Wen Tianxiang was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Song army and led a series of successful campaigns against the Mongols. However, in 1279, the Song army suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Yamen, and the Mongols captured the Song capital of Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou). Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender and was captured by the Mongols.",
