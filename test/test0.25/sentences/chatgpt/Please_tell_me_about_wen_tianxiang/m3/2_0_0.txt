  "explanation": "No, the statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements provide similar information about his background and roles during the Song Dynasty in China. The only difference is the use of the word \"politician\" in the first statement and \"statesman\" in the second statement, which are interchangeable terms. Overall, both statements convey the same information about Wen Tianxiang's multifaceted career in Chinese history."
