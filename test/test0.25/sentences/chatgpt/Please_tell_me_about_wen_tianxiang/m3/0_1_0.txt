  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Wen Tianxiang are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that he is best known for his role in resisting the Mongol invasion and his famous poem, while statement 2 suggests that he is best known for his patriotic poetry written during his exile after being captured by the Mongol Empire. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present different aspects of Wen Tianxiang's life and achievements as his primary claim to fame."
