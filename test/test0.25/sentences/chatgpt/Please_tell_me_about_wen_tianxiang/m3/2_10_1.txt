Wen Tianxiang was a prominent figure during the last years of the Southern Song Dynasty, which was under constant threat from the Mongol Empire. He served as a military general and was known for his bravery and strategic thinking. He was also a talented scholar and wrote several influential works on politics and military strategy. In 1278, Wen Tianxiang was captured by the Mongols and was taken to the capital of the Yuan Dynasty, where he was tortured and eventually executed. However, his legacy lived on, and he became a symbol of loyalty and patriotism in Chinese history. Wen Tianxiang is best known for his famous poem, \"Song of Righteousness,\" which he wrote while in captivity.
