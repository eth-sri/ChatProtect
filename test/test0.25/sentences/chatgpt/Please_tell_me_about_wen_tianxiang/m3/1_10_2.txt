  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song Dynasty. He is best known for his role in resisting the Mongol invasion of China and for his literary works. Wen Tianxiang was born into a family of scholars and officials in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. He began his career as a scholar and was appointed to various government positions, including the governorship of Jiangxi Province. In 1278, the Mongol Empire launched a massive invasion of Southern Song Dynasty, which had been weakened by internal strife and corruption. Wen Tianxiang was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Song army and led a series of successful campaigns against the Mongols. However, in 1279, the Song army suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Yamen, and the Mongols captured the Song capital of Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou). Wen Tianxiang refused to surrender and was captured by the Mongols. He was taken to the Mongol capital of Dadu (present-day Beijing) and was executed in 1283. Wen Tianxiang is remembered as a national hero and a symbol of resistance against foreign invasion.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his literary works, particularly the famous poem \"Song of Righteousness,\" and how they have inspired generations of Chinese patriots. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that the poem was written by Wen Tianxiang, while statement 2 emphasizes how his patriotic spirit and heroic deeds inspired the poem. However, both statements ultimately convey the same message about the significance of Wen Tianxiang's literary works in Chinese history and culture."
