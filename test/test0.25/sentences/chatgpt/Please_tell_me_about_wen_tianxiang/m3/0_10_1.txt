  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Southern Song dynasty. He is best known for his role in resisting the Mongol invasion of China and his famous poem \"Song of Righteousness\" (also known as \"Song of the Loyalty and Righteousness\"). Wen was born in Haining, Zhejiang province, and received a classical education in Confucianism and literature. He entered government service in his early twenties and rose to become a high-ranking official in the Southern Song court. However, in 1278, he was accused of treason by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and was demoted to a minor post. In 1279, the Song dynasty was defeated by the Mongols in the Battle of Yamen, and the emperor and many officials fled to the south. Wen refused to surrender and instead joined a group of loyalists who continued to resist the Mongols. He was captured by the enemy in 1283 and executed for his defiance. Wen's \"Song of Righteousness\" is a powerful expression of his loyalty to the Song dynasty and his determination to resist the Mongol invaders. The poem has become a symbol of Chinese patriotism and resistance to foreign aggression.",
