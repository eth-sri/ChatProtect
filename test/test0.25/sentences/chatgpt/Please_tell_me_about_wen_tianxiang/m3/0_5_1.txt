While statement 1 provides information about the defeat of the Song dynasty by the Mongols, statement 2 focuses on Wen's actions during the Mongol invasion. Specifically, it highlights how Wen and a small group of loyal followers defended the city of Guangzhou while the emperor and other officials fled to the south. Both statements provide additional context and information about Wen Tianxiang's life and actions during the Mongol invasion."
