  "explanation": "The statements about Homer Simpson are not contradictory, but they do differ slightly in terms of the year of his first appearance. Statement 1 states that Homer first appeared on television in 1989, while Statement 2 clarifies that Dan Castellaneta first voiced Homer in 1987 on The Tracey Ullman Show. However, this difference in dates does not contradict each other, as it is possible for a character to first appear in a different format or medium before appearing on television."
