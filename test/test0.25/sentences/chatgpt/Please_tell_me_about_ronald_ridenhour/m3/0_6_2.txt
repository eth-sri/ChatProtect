  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from other soldiers who had been involved. He was horrified by what he heard and decided to take action. He wrote letters to various government officials, including the President and members of Congress, detailing what had happened at My Lai. Ridenhour's letters helped to bring the massacre to the attention of the public and the military.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the aftermath of the My Lai Massacre, which Ridenhour helped to expose. The first statement mentions that an investigation was launched, which is true, and the second statement adds that several soldiers were court-martialed and found guilty, which is also true. Both statements support the idea that Ridenhour's actions had a significant impact on holding those responsible for the massacre accountable for their actions."
