  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard rumors about it from fellow soldiers and decided to investigate. He spent several months gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses, and eventually wrote a letter to the US Congress and the Pentagon detailing what he had learned. His letter sparked an official investigation into the massacre, which led to the prosecution of several soldiers involved. Ridenhour's bravery and dedication to justice helped to bring attention to the atrocities committed during the Vietnam War and contributed to the anti-war movement. After the war, Ridenhour became an investigative journalist and continued to speak out against government corruption and abuse of power.",
