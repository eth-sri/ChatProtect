  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard rumors about it from fellow soldiers and decided to investigate. He spent several months gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses, and eventually wrote a letter to the US Congress and the Pentagon detailing what he had learned. His letter sparked an official investigation into the massacre, which led to the prosecution of several soldiers involved.",

They both highlight his bravery and dedication to justice in exposing the My Lai Massacre and bringing attention to the atrocities committed during the Vietnam War, which ultimately contributed to the anti-war movement. The only difference between the two statements is the phrasing used to convey the same idea."
