  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. The first statement explains how Ridenhour played a crucial role in exposing the My Lai Massacre by investigating and gathering evidence, and eventually writing a letter to government officials. The second statement adds to the context by revealing that despite Ridenhour's efforts, some high-ranking officials were aware of the massacre but tried to cover it up. Both statements provide different aspects of the same story and do not contradict each other."
