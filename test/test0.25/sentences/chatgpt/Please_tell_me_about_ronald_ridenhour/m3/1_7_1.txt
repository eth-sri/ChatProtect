  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women and children, were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from fellow soldiers who had participated in the operation. Shocked and appalled by what he had heard, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and gathering evidence. He wrote letters to members of Congress, the Pentagon, and the media, detailing what he had learned about the massacre. His efforts helped to bring the incident to public attention and led to an official investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Ridenhour's actions were instrumental in exposing the truth about the My Lai Massacre and holding those responsible accountable for their actions.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he became an activist and advocate for peace and justice after the My Lai Massacre and continued to speak out against war and violence until his death. The only difference is that statement 1 implies that he became an activist after the Vietnam War, while statement 2 specifies that he spoke out against the atrocities committed during the Vietnam War. However, this difference does not contradict the overall message that Ridenhour became an activist and advocate for peace and justice."
