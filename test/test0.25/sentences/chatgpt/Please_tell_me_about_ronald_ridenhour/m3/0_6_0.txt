He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from other soldiers who had been involved. He was horrified by what he heard and decided to take action. He wrote letters to various government officials, including the President and members of Congress, detailing what had happened at My Lai. Ridenhour's letters helped to bring the massacre to the attention of the public and the military.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that an investigation was launched and soldiers were charged/prosecuted for their involvement in the My Lai Massacre. The only difference is in the wording used to describe the outcome of the investigation. Statement 1 says that soldiers were \"eventually charged,\" while Statement 2 says that the investigation \"confirmed the details of the massacre and led to the prosecution\" of soldiers. However, both statements convey the same information that soldiers were held accountable for their actions."
