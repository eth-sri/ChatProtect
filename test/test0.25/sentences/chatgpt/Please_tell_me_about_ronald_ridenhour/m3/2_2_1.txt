  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour heard about the My Lai Massacre from fellow soldiers, but they differ in that statement 1 implies that Ridenhour may have been a participant in the massacre, while statement 2 clarifies that he was not involved but took action to uncover the truth. Overall, the statements provide complementary information about Ridenhour's role in exposing the war crime."
