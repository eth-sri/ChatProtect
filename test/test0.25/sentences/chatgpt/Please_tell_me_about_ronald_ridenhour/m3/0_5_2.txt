  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers who had been present at the scene. Shocked by the brutality of the incident, he began to investigate and gather evidence. He eventually wrote a letter to several high-ranking military officials and members of Congress, detailing what had happened at My Lai.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. They both describe how Ridenhour's letter led to an official investigation into the My Lai Massacre and the prosecution of several US soldiers involved in the crime. The only difference is in the wording of the outcome, with one statement using the term \"prosecution\" and the other using \"court-martial.\" However, both outcomes refer to the legal process by which the soldiers were held accountable for their actions."
