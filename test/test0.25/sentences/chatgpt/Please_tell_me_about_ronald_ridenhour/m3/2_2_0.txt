Statement 1 emphasizes that Ridenhour learned about the massacre from soldiers who were involved in it, while Statement 2 specifies that he learned about it from soldiers who were part of the operation. Both statements ultimately convey the same idea that Ridenhour played a crucial role in exposing the My Lai Massacre."
