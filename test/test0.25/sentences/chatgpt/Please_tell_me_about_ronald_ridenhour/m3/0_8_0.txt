  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from other soldiers who had been involved. He was horrified by what he heard and decided to take action. He wrote letters to various government officials, including the President and members of Congress, detailing what had happened at My Lai. Ridenhour's letters helped to bring the massacre to the attention of the public and the military. An investigation was launched, and several soldiers were eventually charged with crimes related to the massacre. Ridenhour received numerous awards and honors for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements describe his post-military career as an advocate for justice and peace, with statement 1 specifically mentioning his work as an investigative journalist and statement 2 using the broader term \"activist.\" Both statements are consistent with Ridenhour's reputation as a whistleblower and advocate for social justice."
