  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by American soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers who had participated in it. Shocked and appalled by what he had heard, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and gathering evidence. He eventually wrote a letter to several high-ranking government officials, including President Richard Nixon, detailing what had happened at My Lai. Ridenhour's letter sparked an official investigation into the massacre, which led to the prosecution of several soldiers involved in the killings. His actions helped to bring attention to the atrocities committed by American soldiers in Vietnam and contributed to the growing anti-war movement in the United States. After the war, Ridenhour became an activist and writer, speaking out against war and advocating for peace and justice.",
