  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians were killed. Ridenhour was not present at the massacre, but he heard about it from other soldiers who had been involved. He was horrified by what he heard and decided to take action. He wrote letters to various government officials, including the President and members of Congress, detailing what had happened at My Lai. Ridenhour's letters helped to bring the massacre to the attention of the public and the military.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. They both refer to the aftermath of Ridenhour's actions in exposing the My Lai Massacre. The first statement mentions that an investigation was launched, which is a factual statement. The second statement expands on this by noting that several soldiers were charged and convicted as a result of Ridenhour's efforts. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Ridenhour played a key role in bringing the truth about the massacre to light and holding those responsible accountable for their actions."
