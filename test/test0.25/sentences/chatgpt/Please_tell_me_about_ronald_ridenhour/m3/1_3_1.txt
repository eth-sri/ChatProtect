Both statements highlight his efforts to expose the My Lai Massacre by gathering evidence and writing letters to government officials. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes his investigative work, while statement 2 emphasizes his advocacy through letter writing. However, both statements ultimately support the same narrative of Ridenhour's role in exposing the war crime."
