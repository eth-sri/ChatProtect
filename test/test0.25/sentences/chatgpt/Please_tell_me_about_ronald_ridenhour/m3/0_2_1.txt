  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory, as they both convey the same information that Ridenhour learned about the My Lai Massacre from other soldiers who had been involved. The only difference is in the wording, with one statement using the word \"heard\" and the other using the phrase \"heard rumors.\" However, both statements support the fact that Ridenhour was not present at the massacre but learned about it secondhand."
