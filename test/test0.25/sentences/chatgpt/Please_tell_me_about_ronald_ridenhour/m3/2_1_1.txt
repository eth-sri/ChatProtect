  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by American soldiers during the Vietnam War. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Ridenhour investigated and exposed the massacre after the war. Overall, both statements provide complementary information about Ridenhour's contribution to exposing the atrocities committed during the Vietnam War."
