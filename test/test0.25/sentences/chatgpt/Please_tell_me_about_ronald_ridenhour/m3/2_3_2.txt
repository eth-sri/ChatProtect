He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by US soldiers in March 1968, in which hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women and children, were killed. After hearing rumors about the massacre from fellow soldiers, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and eventually gathered enough evidence to bring it to the attention of the US Army and the media.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Ridenhour's efforts led to the court-martial of Lieutenant William Calley, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the My Lai Massacre. The only difference between the two statements is the order in which the information is presented."
