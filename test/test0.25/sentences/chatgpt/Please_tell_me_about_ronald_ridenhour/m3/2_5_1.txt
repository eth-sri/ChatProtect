Ridenhour first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers who had participated in it. Shocked and appalled by what he had heard, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and gathering evidence. He eventually wrote a letter to several high-ranking government officials, including President Richard Nixon, detailing what had happened at My Lai.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Ridenhour's letter led to an official investigation and the prosecution of several soldiers involved in the My Lai Massacre. Statement 2 provides additional information about the investigation, specifically that it was led by Lieutenant William Calley, who was eventually found guilty of murder. Both statements are consistent with Ridenhour's role in exposing the war crime and the subsequent investigation and prosecution of those responsible."
