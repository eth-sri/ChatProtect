  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are contradictory as they present him as having two different professions - a soldier and a journalist. While it is possible for someone to have served in the military and later become a journalist, the two statements suggest that Ridenhour was both at the same time, which is not possible. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
