  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour was not present during the My Lai Massacre but heard about it from fellow soldiers and decided to investigate. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which specifies that Ridenhour conducted his own investigation. However, both statements convey the same information about Ridenhour's actions in exposing the war crime."
