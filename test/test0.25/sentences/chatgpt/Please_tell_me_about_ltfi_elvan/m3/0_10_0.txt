  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are not contradictory, as they both express criticism of his handling of the Turkish economy. The first statement mentions criticism of his ties to the government, while the second statement specifically cites criticism during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, both statements ultimately convey a negative assessment of Elvan's performance as Minister of Finance and Treasury."
