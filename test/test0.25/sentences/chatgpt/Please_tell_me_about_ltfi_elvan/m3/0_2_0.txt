  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he graduated from the Middle East Technical University in Ankara with a degree in civil engineering, while statement 2 says that he graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. These are two different universities, and therefore cannot both be true."
