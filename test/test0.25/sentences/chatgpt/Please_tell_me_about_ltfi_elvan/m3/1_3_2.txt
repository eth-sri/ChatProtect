  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory as Statement 1 states that he earned a master's degree in transportation engineering from the Middle East Technical University, while Statement 2 states that he pursued a master's degree in civil engineering at the University of Delaware in the United States. These two degrees are in different fields, so they cannot both be true."
