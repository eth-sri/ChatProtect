  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory as they provide different information about where he pursued his master's degree. Statement 1 states that he earned a master's degree in transportation engineering from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom, while statement 2 says that he went to the United States to pursue a master's degree in civil engineering at the University of Delaware. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, indicating a contradiction."
