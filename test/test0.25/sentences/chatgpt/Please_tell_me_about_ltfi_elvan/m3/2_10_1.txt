Both statements mention his involvement in infrastructure projects, specifically the construction of highways, railways, and airports in Turkey. The only difference is that statement 1 uses the word \"several\" while statement 2 uses the word \"various\". However, this difference in wording does not change the overall meaning of the statements."
