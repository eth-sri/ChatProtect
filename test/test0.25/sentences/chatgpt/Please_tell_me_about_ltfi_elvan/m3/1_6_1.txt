  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory as they provide different dates for his appointment as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. Statement 1 states that he was appointed in July 2018, while statement 2 states that he was appointed in November 2020. These dates are two years apart, and therefore cannot both be true."
