  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Elvan began his political career in 2002 as a Member of Parliament for the AKP, while Statement 2 suggests that he started his political career with the AKP in 2011. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the beginning of Elvan's political career."
