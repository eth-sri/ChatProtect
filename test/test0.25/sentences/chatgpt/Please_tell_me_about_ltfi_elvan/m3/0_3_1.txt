  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory as they provide different information about his academic background. Statement 1 states that he earned a master's degree in transportation engineering from the University of Leeds, while statement 2 states that he earned a master's degree in civil engineering from the University of Birmingham. These two degrees are in different fields, so they cannot both be true."
