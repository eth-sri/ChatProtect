The stadium has a seating capacity of 20,000 spectators and is primarily used for football matches. It is the home stadium of Persiram Raja Ampat, a professional football club that competes in the Liga 3, the third tier of Indonesian football. The stadium was built in 1998 and was named after Thomas Matulessy, also known as Pattimura, a national hero from Maluku who led a rebellion against Dutch colonial rule in the 19th century. The stadium has undergone several renovations over the years, including the installation of a new artificial turf in 2017.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the stadium has hosted various events such as music concerts and cultural festivals, indicating that the stadium is not solely used for football matches. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions religious gatherings while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the fact that the stadium has hosted various cultural events and concerts."
