  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory. They both state that the stadium is used for events other than football matches, such as concerts and religious gatherings. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that the concerts are music concerts, while statement 1 does not. However, this difference does not create a contradiction."
