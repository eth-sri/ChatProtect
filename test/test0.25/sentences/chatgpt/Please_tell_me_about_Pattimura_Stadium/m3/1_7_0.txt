Both statements emphasize the importance of the stadium as a landmark in Ambon city and a popular destination for tourists. The only difference is that statement 2 uses the word \"iconic\" to describe the stadium, which adds a stronger emphasis on its significance. However, both statements convey a positive view of the stadium and its role in the city."
