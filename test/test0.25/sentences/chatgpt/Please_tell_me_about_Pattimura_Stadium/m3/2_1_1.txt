  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the stadium has a seating capacity of 20,000 spectators, while statement 2 says that it can hold up to 25,000 spectators. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the stadium's capacity."
