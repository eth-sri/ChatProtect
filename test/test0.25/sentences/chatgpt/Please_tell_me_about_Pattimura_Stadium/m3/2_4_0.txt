Both statements mention that the stadium has undergone renovations and upgrades over the years, but they provide different details about the specific renovations. Statement 1 mentions the installation of a new artificial turf in 2017, while Statement 2 provides a more general statement about the improvements made to meet international standards. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about the stadium."
