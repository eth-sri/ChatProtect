Both statements mention that Pattimura Stadium has hosted cultural and entertainment events, such as music concerts and festivals, in addition to football matches. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions that the stadium has hosted events other than football, while statement 2 simply includes cultural events as one of the types of events hosted at the stadium."
