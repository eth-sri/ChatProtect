  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory. They both provide information about the stadium's name and its connection to Thomas Matulessy, a national hero from Maluku who led a rebellion against Dutch colonial rule in the 19th century. The first statement explains that the stadium was named after Pattimura, while the second statement adds that it was previously named Lapangan Merdeka before being renamed Pattimura Stadium in 2006."
