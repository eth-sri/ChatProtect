  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the gradual depletion of troops and resources in the army as the war progressed. Statement 1 specifically mentions the army being severely understrength during the Allied invasion of Okinawa, while Statement 2 mentions soldiers being sent to other fronts. Both statements support the idea that the Thirty-First Army was gradually weakened over time."
