  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a specific example of the army's involvement in a battle during World War II, while Statement 2 provides a broader overview of the army's role in defending the Philippines against American forces. Both statements are consistent with the fact that the Thirty-First Army was primarily responsible for the defense of the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines during the war."
