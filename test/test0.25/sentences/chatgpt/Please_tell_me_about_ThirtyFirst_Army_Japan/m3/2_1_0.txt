  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the army was formed on March 9, 1944, and was primarily responsible for the defense of the Japanese-occupied Philippines. However, statement 2 contradicts this by stating that the army was formed on April 6, 1944, in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the formation and location of the Thirty-First Army."
