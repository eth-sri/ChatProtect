  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on 6 May 1944 in the Philippines under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who had previously led the successful invasion of Malaya and Singapore. The Thirty-First Army was tasked with defending the Philippines against the advancing Allied forces, which had already landed on the island of Leyte. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Yamashita and his troops put up a fierce resistance, launching several counterattacks against the Allied forces. However, the tide of the war had turned against Japan, and the Thirty-First Army was eventually defeated. Yamashita surrendered to the Allies on 2 September 1945, marking the end of World War II in the Philippines. The Thirty-First Army is perhaps best known for the atrocities committed by its troops during the Battle of Manila in February 1945. Japanese soldiers massacred thousands of Filipino civilians, including women and children, and destroyed much of the city in a desperate attempt to hold off the advancing Allied forces. The legacy of the Thirty-First Army and its commander, Tomoyuki Yamashita, remains controversial to this day.",
