  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on August 9, 1944, under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka, and was primarily responsible for the defense of the Japanese home islands against possible Allied invasion. The Thirty-First Army was initially stationed in the Kyushu region of Japan, where it was tasked with preparing defensive positions and fortifications. However, as the war progressed, the army was gradually depleted of troops and resources, and by the time of the Allied invasion of Okinawa in April 1945, it was severely understrength. Despite this, the Thirty-First Army fought fiercely against the American forces during the Battle of Okinawa, which lasted from April to June 1945. The army suffered heavy losses, with over 70,000 soldiers killed or wounded, but managed to hold out against the Allied assault for several weeks before finally being defeated.",
