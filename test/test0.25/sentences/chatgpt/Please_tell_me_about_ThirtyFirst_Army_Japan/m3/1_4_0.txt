  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on August 9, 1944, under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka, and was primarily responsible for the defense of the Japanese home islands against possible Allied invasion. The Thirty-First Army was initially stationed in the Kyushu region of Japan, where it was tasked with preparing defensive positions and fortifications. However, as the war progressed, the army was gradually depleted of troops and resources, and by the time of the Allied invasion of Okinawa in April 1945, it was severely understrength.",

The second statement simply states that the army was disbanded at the end of World War II, which is not contradictory to the first statement."
