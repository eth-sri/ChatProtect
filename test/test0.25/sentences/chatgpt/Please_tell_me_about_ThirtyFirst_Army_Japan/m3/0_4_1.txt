  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions the Battle of Leyte, which took place in October 1944, while Statement 2 refers to the Battle of Luzon, which occurred in early 1945. Both battles involved the Thirty-First Army fighting against American and Filipino forces, but they were separate engagements that took place at different times and locations."
