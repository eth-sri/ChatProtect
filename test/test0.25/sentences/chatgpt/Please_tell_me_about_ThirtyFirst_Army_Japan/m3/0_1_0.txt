  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. The first statement states that the army was formed on July 9, 1944, and was primarily responsible for the defense of the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines. However, the second statement claims that the army was formed on April 6, 1944, in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the formation and location of the Thirty-First Army."
