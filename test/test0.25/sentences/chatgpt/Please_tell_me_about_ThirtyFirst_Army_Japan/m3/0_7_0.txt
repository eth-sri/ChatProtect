It was formed on July 9, 1944, under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka and was primarily responsible for the defense of the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Thirty-First Army was composed of approximately 80,000 troops, including both Japanese and Filipino soldiers. Its main units included the 10th Independent Mixed Brigade, the 102nd Division, and the 103rd Division. In October 1944, the Thirty-First Army fought in the Battle of Leyte, where it faced off against American forces led by General Douglas MacArthur. Despite putting up a fierce resistance, the Japanese were eventually defeated, and the Thirty-First Army suffered heavy losses. After the Battle of Leyte, the Thirty-First Army was reorganized and sent to defend the island of Luzon.",

Both statements are consistent with the overall narrative of the Thirty-First Army's involvement in World War II."
