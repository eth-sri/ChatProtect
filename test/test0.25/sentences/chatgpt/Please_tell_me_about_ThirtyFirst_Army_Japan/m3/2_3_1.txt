  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the army's retreat, but they refer to different locations. Statement 1 states that the army retreated southwards, while Statement 2 mentions a retreat to the mountains of northern Luzon. These are not contradictory as the army could have retreated to the mountains after initially moving southwards. Therefore, the statements provide complementary information about the army's movements during the war."
