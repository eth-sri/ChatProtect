  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. The first statement states that the army was formed on August 9, 1944, while the second statement claims that it was formed on April 6, 1944. These two dates cannot both be correct, so the statements contradict each other."
