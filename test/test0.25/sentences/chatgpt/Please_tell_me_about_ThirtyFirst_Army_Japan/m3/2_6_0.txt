  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on March 9, 1944, under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka, and was primarily responsible for the defense of the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Thirty-First Army was composed of approximately 200,000 troops, including both Japanese soldiers and Filipino volunteers. It was initially stationed in northern Luzon, but as the Allied forces began to advance towards the Philippines, the army was forced to retreat southwards. In October 1944, the Thirty-First Army was involved in the Battle of Leyte, which was one of the largest and most significant battles of the Pacific War. Despite fierce resistance, the Japanese were eventually defeated, and the Thirty-First Army suffered heavy losses.",
