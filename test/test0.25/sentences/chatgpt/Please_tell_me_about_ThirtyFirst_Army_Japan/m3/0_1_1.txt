  "explanation": "The two statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the army was formed on July 9, 1944, and was under the command of General Shizuichi Tanaka. Additionally, both statements state that the army was responsible for defending the northern part of the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The only difference between the two statements is the wording used to describe the army's responsibilities. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
