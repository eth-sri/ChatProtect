Statement 1 provides specific information about the Thirty-First Army's involvement in the Battle of Leyte, while Statement 2 provides a broader overview of the army's role in the Philippines Campaign. Both statements are consistent with the fact that the Thirty-First Army fought against American and Filipino forces during World War II."
