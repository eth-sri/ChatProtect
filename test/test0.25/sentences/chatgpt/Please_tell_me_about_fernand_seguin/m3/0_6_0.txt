Both statements mention that he received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, but they list different specific awards. Statement 1 mentions the Order of Canada and the Prix du Qu\u00e9bec, while Statement 2 mentions the Order of Canada and the Royal Society of Canada's Flavelle Medal. Therefore, the statements are complementary rather than contradictory."
