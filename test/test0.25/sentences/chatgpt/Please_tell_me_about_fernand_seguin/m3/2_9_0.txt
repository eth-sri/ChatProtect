He was born in Montreal and studied at the University of Montreal, where he earned a degree in biochemistry. He went on to earn a PhD in biochemistry from the University of Paris. Seguin was a pioneer in the field of environmental science in Canada. He was one of the first scientists to study the effects of pollution on the environment, and he was a strong advocate for environmental protection. He was also a popular broadcaster, hosting several television and radio programs on science and the environment. Seguin was instrumental in the creation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) science program, \"Quirks and Quarks,\" which is still on the air today. He also served as the director of the Montreal Biodome, a popular science museum that showcases the ecosystems of the Americas.

  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1986 and inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 1995, while Statement 2 says that he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1976. Since the two statements provide different years for when he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, they cannot both be true."
