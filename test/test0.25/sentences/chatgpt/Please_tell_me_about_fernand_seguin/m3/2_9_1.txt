  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 1995, while statement 2 says that he was inducted in 2016. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different years for the same event."
