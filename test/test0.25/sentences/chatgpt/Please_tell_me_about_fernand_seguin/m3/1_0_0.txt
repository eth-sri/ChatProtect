  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. The first statement describes him as a scientist and environmentalist, while the second statement describes him as a biochemist and radio and television host. While biochemistry is a scientific field, it is not necessarily synonymous with being an environmentalist. Additionally, being a radio and television host does not necessarily align with being an environmentalist or scientist. Therefore, the two statements present different aspects of Fernand Seguin's career and do not fully align."
