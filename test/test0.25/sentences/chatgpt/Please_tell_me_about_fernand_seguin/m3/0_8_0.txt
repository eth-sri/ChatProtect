  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he held a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Montreal (or Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al). The first statement goes on to mention that he conducted research in various fields, while the second statement simply repeats the fact that he had a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Therefore, the statements are complementary and provide additional information about Seguin's academic background."
