Both statements mention his dedication to the study of the environment and his instrumental role in the creation of the Biosphere museum in Montreal. The only difference is in the wording of the first statement, which also emphasizes his advocacy for environmental conservation. However, this does not contradict the second statement, which also highlights his dedication to the study of the environment."
