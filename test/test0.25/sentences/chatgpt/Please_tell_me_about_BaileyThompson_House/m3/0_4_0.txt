  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. The first statement mentions the installation of leaded glass windows, while the second statement mentions the installation of stained glass windows. Leaded glass and stained glass are two different types of glass, with leaded glass being clear or colored glass held together by lead strips, and stained glass being colored glass that has been painted or stained and then fused together."
