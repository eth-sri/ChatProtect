The house was designed in the Queen Anne style and features a wrap-around porch, ornate woodwork, and stained glass windows. In 1917, the house was purchased by the Thompson family, who owned it for over 50 years. During their ownership, they made several renovations and additions to the house, including the addition of a sunroom and a second-story balcony. In 1973, the house was purchased by the Tallahassee Junior League, who restored it and turned it into a community center. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House is used for events such as weddings, receptions, and meetings.",
