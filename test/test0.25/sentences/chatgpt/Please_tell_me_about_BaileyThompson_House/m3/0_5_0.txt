  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by George W. Saxon, a prominent local builder, for William Bailey, a successful businessman and politician. The house is a fine example of Queen Anne-style architecture, with its asymmetrical facade, steeply pitched roof, and ornate detailing. In 1905, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a prominent attorney and judge. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including the addition of a large front porch and the installation of leaded glass windows.",

Statement 1 says that the house remained in the Thompson family until 1986, while statement 2 says that it remained in the family until 1967. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the same event."
