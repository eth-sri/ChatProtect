  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by John G. Bailey, a prominent local businessman and politician. The house is a prime example of the Queen Anne architectural style, with its asymmetrical design, steeply pitched roof, and decorative elements such as turrets, bay windows, and ornate woodwork. In 1912, the house was purchased by William and Mary Thompson, who made significant renovations and additions to the property. The Thompsons were also prominent members of the Tallahassee community, with William serving as the city's mayor from 1913 to 1915. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until the 1980s, when it was sold to the state of Florida and became part of the Florida Governor's Mansion complex.",
