  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by George W. Saxon, a prominent local builder, for William Bailey, a successful businessman and politician. The house is a fine example of Queen Anne-style architecture, with its asymmetrical facade, steeply pitched roof, and ornate detailing. In 1905, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a prominent attorney and judge. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including the addition of a large front porch and the installation of leaded glass windows. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until 1986, when it was purchased by the Tallahassee Historical Society.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. They both provide information about the house being restored and opened to the public as a museum. The first statement explains that the society restored the house to its original grandeur before opening it to the public, while the second statement specifies that the house opened as a museum in 1991 and is now available for tours. Both statements complement each other and provide a complete picture of the current state of the Bailey-Thompson House."
