  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1908 by George W. Saxon, a prominent local businessman, and was later purchased by William Bailey, a successful attorney and politician. The house is a two-story, wood-frame structure with a wraparound porch and a distinctive turret. It features a mix of architectural styles, including Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Classical Revival. In the 1930s, the house was purchased by the Thompson family, who owned it for several decades. During this time, the house underwent several renovations and additions, including the addition of a swimming pool and a garage. The Thompsons were known for their lavish parties and social events, and the house was a popular gathering place for Tallahassee's elite. In the 1970s, the house was purchased by the state of Florida and was used as the headquarters for the Florida Department of Education.",

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993, while statement 2 says that it was added in 1980. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different dates for the same event."
