  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the house was built in 1895 by John G. Bailey, while statement 2 claims that it was built in 1885 for attorney Charles H. Bailey. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the origin of the house."
