  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by a prominent local businessman named John Bailey. The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style structure with a wrap-around porch and a turret. It features a variety of architectural details, including stained glass windows, decorative woodwork, and a large bay window. In 1911, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in the lumber industry. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including the addition of a large ballroom on the second floor. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until the 1980s, when it was sold to the state of Florida. Today, the house is used as a conference center and event space.",

The fact that the house is open for public tours on certain days of the week does not contradict the fact that it is also used as a conference center and event space. Similarly, the fact that it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places does not contradict any of the other information provided about the house."
