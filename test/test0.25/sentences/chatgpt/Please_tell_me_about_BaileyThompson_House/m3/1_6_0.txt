It features a variety of architectural details, including stained glass windows, decorative woodwork, and a large bay window. In 1911, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in the lumber industry.

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the house was sold to the state of Florida in the 1980s, while statement 2 says that it remained in the Thompson family until the 1960s. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the ownership of the house."
