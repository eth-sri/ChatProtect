  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by a prominent local businessman named John Bailey. The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style structure with a wrap-around porch and a turret. It features a variety of architectural details, including stained glass windows, decorative woodwork, and a large bay window. In 1911, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in the lumber industry. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including the addition of a large ballroom on the second floor.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the house remained in the Thompson family until the 1980s, while Statement 2 specifies that it was sold to the state of Florida in 1979 and is now used as the Governor's Mansion Annex. These statements are not contradictory because it is possible that the Thompson family sold the house to the state of Florida in 1979, but it remained in their possession until the 1980s. Therefore, both statements can be true."
