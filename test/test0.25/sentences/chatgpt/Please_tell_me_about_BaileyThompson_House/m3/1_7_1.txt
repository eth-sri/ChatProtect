The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style structure with a wrap-around porch and a turret. In 1925, the house was sold to the Thompson family, who owned it until 1985. During their ownership, the house underwent several renovations and additions, including the addition of a third floor and a garage. In 1985, the house was purchased by the Tallahassee Historical Society and restored to its original condition. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House serves as the headquarters for the Tallahassee Historical Society and is open to the public for tours and events.",
