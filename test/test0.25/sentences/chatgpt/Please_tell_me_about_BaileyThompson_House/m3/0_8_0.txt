  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by George W. Saxon, a prominent local builder, for William Bailey, a successful businessman and politician. The house is a fine example of Queen Anne-style architecture, with its asymmetrical facade, steeply pitched roof, and ornate detailing. In 1905, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a prominent attorney and judge. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including the addition of a large front porch and the installation of leaded glass windows. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until 1986, when it was purchased by the Tallahassee Historical Society. The society restored the house to its original grandeur and opened it to the public as a museum. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House is a popular tourist attraction and a valuable resource for those interested in the history and architecture of Tallahassee.",
