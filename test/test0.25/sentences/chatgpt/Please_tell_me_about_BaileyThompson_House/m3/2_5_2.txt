The house is a prime example of the Queen Anne architectural style, with its asymmetrical design, steeply pitched roof, and decorative elements such as turrets, bay windows, and ornate woodwork. In 1912, the house was purchased by William and Mary Thompson, who made significant renovations and additions to the property. The Thompsons were also prominent members of the Tallahassee community, with William serving as the city's mayor from 1913 to 1915.",

Statement 1 explains that the house was sold to the state of Florida in the 1980s and became part of the Governor's Mansion complex, while Statement 2 explains that it was designated as a historic landmark in 1979. These two statements provide different pieces of information about the history of the house, but they do not contradict each other."
