  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory as they provide different years for when the house was built and by whom. Statement 1 claims that the house was built in 1895 by John Bailey, while statement 2 claims that it was built in 1885 for Charles H. Bailey. These discrepancies suggest that one or both of the statements may be inaccurate or incomplete. Further research would be necessary to determine the true history of the Bailey-Thompson House."
