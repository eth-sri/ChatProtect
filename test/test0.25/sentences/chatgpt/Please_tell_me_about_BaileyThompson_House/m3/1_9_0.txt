  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by a prominent local businessman named John Bailey. The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style structure with a wrap-around porch and a turret. It features a variety of architectural details, including stained glass windows, decorative woodwork, and a large bay window. In 1911, the house was purchased by William Thompson, a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in the lumber industry. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including the addition of a large ballroom on the second floor. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until the 1980s, when it was sold to the state of Florida. Today, the house is used as a conference center and event space. It is also open for public tours on certain days of the week.",
