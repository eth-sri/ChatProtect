  "explanation": "The two statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the Tallahassee Historical Society purchased the house in 1985 and restored it to its original condition, while statement 2 adds that the house was restored in the 1990s and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These statements complement each other, as statement 1 provides information about the initial restoration and ownership change, while statement 2 adds further detail about the house's current status as a historic landmark."
