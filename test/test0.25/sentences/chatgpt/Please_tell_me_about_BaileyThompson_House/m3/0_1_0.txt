  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the house was built in 1895 for William Bailey, while statement 2 states that it was built in 1885 for Charles H. Bailey. The difference in the year and the name of the original owner suggests that the two statements are referring to different houses or that one of them is incorrect."
