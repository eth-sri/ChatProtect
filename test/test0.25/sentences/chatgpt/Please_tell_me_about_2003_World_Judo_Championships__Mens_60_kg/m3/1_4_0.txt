  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the bronze medals were won by Ruben Houkes of the Netherlands and Hiroshi Izumi of Japan, while Statement 2 claims that the bronze medals were won by Georgii Zantaraia of Ukraine and Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Limardo of Venezuela. These are two different sets of athletes, and therefore cannot both be true."
