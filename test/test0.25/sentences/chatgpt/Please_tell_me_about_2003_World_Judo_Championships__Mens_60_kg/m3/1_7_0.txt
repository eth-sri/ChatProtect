  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that Tadahiro Nomura went on to win another Olympic gold medal in 2004, which is true. Statement 2 adds to this by specifying that he won his fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in the 60 kg category at the 2004 Athens Olympics, which is also true. Both statements provide additional information about Nomura's achievements after the 2003 World Judo Championships, but they do not contradict each other."
