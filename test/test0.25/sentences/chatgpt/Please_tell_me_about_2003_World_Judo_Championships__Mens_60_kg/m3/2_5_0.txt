  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba and Yosvany Despaigne of Cuba both competed in the tournament and lost in the bronze medal matches, while Statement 2 suggests that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France was one of the competitors who lost in the bronze medal match. However, only one bronze medal was awarded to each of the two winners, Hiroaki Hiraoka of Japan and Georgi Georgiev of Bulgaria, indicating that only two competitors could have won bronze medals in the tournament. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
