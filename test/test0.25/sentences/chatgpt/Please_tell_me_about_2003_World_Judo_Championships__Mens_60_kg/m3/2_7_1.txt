  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the text mentions Nomura's victory at the 2003 World Judo Championships and his third consecutive world title in the 60 kg category, statement 1 adds that he went on to win a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in the same category at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Statement 2 further emphasizes Nomura's achievement by noting that he became the first judoka to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the same weight category. Both statements provide additional information about Nomura's success in the 60 kg category, but they do not contradict each other."
