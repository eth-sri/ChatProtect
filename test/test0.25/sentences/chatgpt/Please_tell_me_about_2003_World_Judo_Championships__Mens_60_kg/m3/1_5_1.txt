  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Hiroshi Izumi won the bronze medal by defeating Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba, while Statement 2 claims that Izumi won the bronze medal by defeating Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France. These two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different opponents and outcomes for Izumi's bronze medal match."
