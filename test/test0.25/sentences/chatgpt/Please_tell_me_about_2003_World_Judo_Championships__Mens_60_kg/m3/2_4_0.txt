  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory as they provide different information about who won the bronze medals. Statement 1 states that the bronze medals were won by Hiroaki Hiraoka of Japan and Georgi Georgiev of Bulgaria, while statement 2 states that the bronze medals were won by Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France. Only one set of judokas could have won the bronze medals, so the statements cannot both be true."
