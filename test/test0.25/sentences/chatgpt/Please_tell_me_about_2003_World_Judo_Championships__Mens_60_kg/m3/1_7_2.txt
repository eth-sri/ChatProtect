  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement mentions Nomura winning another Olympic gold medal in 2004, it does not specify that it was in the same weight class as the 2003 World Judo Championships. The second statement clarifies that Nomura did indeed win his fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in the 60 kg category, which is consistent with his victory at the 2003 World Judo Championships."
