The gold medal was won by Tadahiro Nomura of Japan, who defeated Ludwig Paischer of Austria in the final. Nomura, who had won the gold medal in the same weight category at the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games, became the first judoka in history to win three Olympic gold medals in a row. His victory at the 2003 World Championships cemented his status as one of the greatest judokas of all time. The bronze medals were won by Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba and Hiroshi Izumi of Japan.",
