  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the bronze medals were won by Ludwig Paischer of Austria and Hiroshi Izumi of Japan, while Statement 2 claims that the bronze medals were won by Ludwig Paischer of Austria and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the same event. Therefore, they are contradictory."
