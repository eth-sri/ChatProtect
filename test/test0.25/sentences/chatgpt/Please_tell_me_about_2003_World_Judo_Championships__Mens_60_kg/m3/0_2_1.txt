  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Tadahiro Nomura of Japan won the gold medal by defeating Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba in the final, while Statement 2 claims that Ludwig Paischer of Austria won the gold medal by defeating Hiroshi Izumi of Japan in the final. These two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different outcomes for the same event."
