  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Ruben Houkes won the bronze medal by defeating Georgi Georgiev of Bulgaria, while Hiroshi Izumi won the other bronze medal by defeating Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba. However, Statement 2 says that Houkes won the bronze medal by defeating Nestor Khergiani of Georgia. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about who won the bronze medal matches."
