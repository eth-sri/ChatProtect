  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the playoffs, specifically that the top six teams advanced and that the playoff series were played in a best-of-five format. The second statement simply adds the word \"format\" to clarify the structure of the playoff series."
