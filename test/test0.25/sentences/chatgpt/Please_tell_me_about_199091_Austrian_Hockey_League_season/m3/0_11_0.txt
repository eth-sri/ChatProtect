  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. The first statement mentions Reinhard Divis as a forward for EC KAC Klagenfurt who had 70 points in 36 games, while the second statement corrects the information and states that Raimund Divis was the goaltender for EC KAC Klagenfurt who had a league-leading 2.33 goals against average. These are two different players with different positions and statistics, so the statements cannot both be true."
