  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. They both provide information about notable players who played in the league during that season, but they mention different players and different statistics. Statement 1 mentions Dieter Kalt, an Austrian forward who led the league in scoring, while Statement 2 mentions Jim Vesey, a Canadian forward who finished second in scoring. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
