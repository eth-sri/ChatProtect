  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the semifinals and finals were played at a neutral site, while Statement 2 says that they were played in a best-of-seven format. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as the format of the playoffs and the location of the games are two separate aspects of the season."
