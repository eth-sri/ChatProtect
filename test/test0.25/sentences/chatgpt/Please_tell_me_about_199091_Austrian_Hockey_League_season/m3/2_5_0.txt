  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that EC KAC Klagenfurt defeated EC VSV Villach in the finals to win their 22nd championship, while Statement 2 says that EC KAC Klagenfurt defeated VEU Feldkirch in the finals to win the championship. These two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different outcomes for the finals. Therefore, they are contradictory."
