  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Reinhard Divis of VEU Feldkirch was the league's top goaltender with a goals against average of 2.53 and a save percentage of .909, while Statement 2 claims that Divis had the best save percentage in the league with .926. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide conflicting information about Divis' save percentage. Therefore, they are contradictory."
