  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Jiri Lala finished second in the league in scoring with 84 points, while Statement 2 says that he finished second with 77 points. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, so they contradict each other."
