  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Corey Parker are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he has written several screenplays and produced several independent films, while Statement 2 says that he has produced several screenplays and independent films. The order of the words \"written\" and \"produced\" is reversed in the two statements, which changes the meaning. Therefore, they cannot both be true at the same time."
