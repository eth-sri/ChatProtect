  "explanation": "The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he has directed several episodes of TV shows, but they differ in which shows he has directed. Statement 1 lists \"Vacation\" as one of the shows he has directed, while Statement 2 lists \"Psych\" instead. However, this difference does not contradict the fact that he has directed episodes of multiple TV shows."
