  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is one of the 48 listed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. It is most easily visible in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. The brightest star in Perseus is called Mirfak, which is a yellow-white supergiant star located about 590 light-years away from Earth. Other notable stars in the constellation include Algol, which is a binary star system that appears to change in brightness over time, and Delta Persei, which is a blue-white giant star.",
