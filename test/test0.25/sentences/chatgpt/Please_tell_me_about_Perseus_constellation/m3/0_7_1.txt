  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing Andromeda from a sea monster. The constellation is easily recognizable due to its distinctive shape, which resembles a stick figure holding a sword and the head of Medusa. It is located near other famous constellations such as Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which is famous for its periodic dimming. It also contains several deep-sky objects, such as the Perseus Double Cluster, which is a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye. In addition to its mythological significance, Perseus has played an important role in astronomy.",
