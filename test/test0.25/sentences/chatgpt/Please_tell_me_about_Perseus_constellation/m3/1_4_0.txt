Both statements mention the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster located approximately 250 million light-years away. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that Perseus contains several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, while statement 2 specifically identifies the Perseus Cluster as a famous feature of the constellation."
