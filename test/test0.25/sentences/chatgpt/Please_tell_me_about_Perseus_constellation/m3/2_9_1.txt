The constellation is one of the 48 listed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. It is most easily visible in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. The brightest star in Perseus is called Mirfak, which is a yellow-white supergiant star located about 590 light-years away from Earth. Other notable stars in the constellation include Algol, which is a binary star system that appears to change in brightness over time, and Delta Persei, which is a blue-white giant star. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, which is a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye. There are also several galaxies located within the boundaries of Perseus, including the famous Perseus Cluster of galaxies, which is one of the largest known galaxy clusters in the universe.",
