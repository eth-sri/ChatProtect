  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is easily recognizable due to its distinctive shape, which resembles a \"W\" or \"M\" depending on the orientation. Perseus is home to several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"Demon Star\" due to its unusual variability. It also contains several deep-sky objects, such as the Perseus Cluster, which is one of the largest galaxy clusters known. In Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danae. He was tasked with slaying the Gorgon Medusa and was aided by the goddess Athena, who gave him a mirrored shield to avoid looking directly at Medusa. After slaying Medusa, Perseus used her head as a weapon and eventually became a hero in his own right.",
