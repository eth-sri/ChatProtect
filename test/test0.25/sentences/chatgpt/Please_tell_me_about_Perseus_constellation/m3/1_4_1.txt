Statement 1 mentions the Perseus Cluster, a galaxy cluster, while Statement 2 mentions the Perseus Double Cluster and the California Nebula, both of which are different deep-sky objects. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the various deep-sky objects located within the boundaries of the Perseus constellation."
