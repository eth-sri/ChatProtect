The constellation is easily recognizable due to its distinctive shape, which resembles a \"W\" or \"M\" depending on the orientation. Perseus contains several notable stars, including Algol, which is known as the \"Demon Star\" due to its variable brightness. It also contains several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster located approximately 250 million light-years away.",
