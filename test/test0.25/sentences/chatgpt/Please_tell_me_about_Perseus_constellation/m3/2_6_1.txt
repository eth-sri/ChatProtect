  "alt": "Perseus is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which means that it is home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster located approximately 250 million light-years away from Earth.",
  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is easily recognizable due to its distinctive shape, which resembles a \"W\" or \"M\" depending on the orientation. Perseus is located near several other prominent constellations, including Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus. It is also home to several notable celestial objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known for its periodic fluctuations in brightness. In addition to Algol, Perseus is also home to several other interesting stars, including Mirfak, which is one of the brightest stars in the constellation, and Atik, which is a binary star system consisting of two massive stars that orbit each other.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the Perseus Cluster, a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away from Earth, as a notable deep-sky object in the constellation. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Perseus is located in the Milky Way galaxy, while statement 1 does not. However, this difference does not contradict the information provided in either statement."
