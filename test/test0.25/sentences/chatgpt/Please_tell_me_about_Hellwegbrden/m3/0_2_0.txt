  "explanation": "The statements about Hellwegb\u00f6rden are contradictory. Statement 1 uses the past tense \"ran\" to describe the Hellweg trade route, implying that it no longer exists. In contrast, statement 2 uses the present tense \"runs\" to describe the same trade route, suggesting that it is still in use. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
