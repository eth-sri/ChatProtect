Statement 1 mentions that the region stretches from the Sauerland mountains to the Teutoburg Forest, while statement 2 mentions that it stretches from the Sauerland mountains to the Ruhr valley. The Teutoburg Forest and the Ruhr valley are not the same locations, so the statements cannot both be true."
