He was one of the most influential preachers of the Great Awakening, a religious revival movement that swept through Britain and the American colonies in the 18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and attended Oxford University, where he became involved in the Holy Club, a group of students who were dedicated to religious study and discipline. After his conversion to evangelical Christianity, Whitefield began preaching in the streets and fields of England, drawing large crowds with his powerful and emotional sermons. In 1739, Whitefield traveled to America, where he preached in cities and towns up and down the East Coast.",
