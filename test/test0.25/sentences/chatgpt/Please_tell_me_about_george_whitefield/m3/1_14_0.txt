  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican preacher who became one of the most influential figures in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 18th century. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University, where he became a member of the Holy Club, a group of students who were known for their piety and devotion to God. Whitefield was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1736 and began preaching in London and other parts of England. He quickly gained a reputation as a powerful and charismatic speaker, and his sermons attracted large crowds. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first time, where he preached in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. His preaching had a profound impact on the colonists, and he became known as the \"apostle of the Great Awakening.\" Whitefield's preaching style was characterized by his ability to connect with his audience and to convey the urgency of his message. He preached about the need for personal salvation and the importance of a personal relationship with God. He also spoke out against slavery and advocated for the education of slaves. Whitefield's influence extended beyond the pulpit. He founded an orphanage in Georgia and helped to establish the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He also wrote several books, including a memoir of his travels and sermons. Whitefield died in Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1770, at the age of 55. He was buried in a crypt beneath the pulpit of the Old South Presbyterian Church in Newburyport.",
