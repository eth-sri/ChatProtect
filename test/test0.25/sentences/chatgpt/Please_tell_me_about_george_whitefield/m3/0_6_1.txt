Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. While at Oxford, he became involved with the Holy Club, a group of students who were devoted to religious study and self-discipline. Whitefield was deeply influenced by the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, and became a close friend and collaborator of Wesley's. In 1738, Whitefield traveled to America for the first time, where he preached to large crowds in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities.",
