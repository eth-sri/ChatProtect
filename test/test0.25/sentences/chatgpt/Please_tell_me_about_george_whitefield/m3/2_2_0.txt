  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are contradictory as they provide different information about where he was educated. Statement 1 says he was educated at Oxford University, while Statement 2 specifies that he was educated at Pembroke College, which is a constituent college of Oxford University. However, the two statements do not contradict the fact that Whitefield was an influential figure of the Great Awakening."
