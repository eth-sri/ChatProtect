  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about his background and education, with statement 1 focusing on his early life and involvement with the Holy Club, and statement 2 highlighting the role of Oxford University in his ordination as a minister. Together, they provide a more complete picture of Whitefield's upbringing and path to becoming a prominent religious figure."
