  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher who lived from 1714 to 1770. He was one of the most influential preachers of the Great Awakening, a religious revival movement that swept through Britain and the American colonies in the 18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and attended Oxford University, where he became involved in the Holy Club, a group of students who were dedicated to religious study and discipline. After his conversion to evangelical Christianity, Whitefield began preaching in the streets and fields of England, drawing large crowds with his powerful and emotional sermons. In 1739, Whitefield traveled to America, where he preached in cities and towns up and down the East Coast. He was particularly popular in Philadelphia, where he helped to establish the first Methodist church in America. Whitefield's preaching style was characterized by his ability to move his listeners to tears and to inspire them to make a personal commitment to Christ. Whitefield was also a prolific writer, publishing numerous sermons and tracts during his lifetime. He was a strong advocate for the abolition of slavery and worked closely with the founders of the Georgia colony to establish a settlement that would be free of slavery. Whitefield died in Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1770, at the age of 55.",
