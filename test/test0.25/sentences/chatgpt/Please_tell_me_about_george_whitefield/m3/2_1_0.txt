  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight his significant role in the Great Awakening, a religious movement that had a profound impact on American society in the 18th century. While statement 1 emphasizes Whitefield's influence as a preacher during the Great Awakening, statement 2 adds that he was also a founder of Methodism, a denomination that emerged from the revival. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of Whitefield's impact on American religious history."
