  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher who lived from 1714 to 1770. He was one of the most influential figures of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a preacher in the Church of England and quickly gained a reputation for his powerful and emotional sermons. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first time and began preaching to large crowds in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. Whitefield's preaching style was characterized by his ability to move his audience to tears and to inspire them to commit themselves to a life of piety and devotion. He was also known for his use of outdoor venues, such as fields and parks, to preach to large crowds. Whitefield's influence extended beyond the American colonies. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Wales, preaching to thousands of people and helping to spread the Great Awakening throughout the British Isles. Despite his popularity, Whitefield was not without his critics.",
