  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about his birthplace and his involvement with the Holy Club at Oxford University, while Statement 2 simply adds that he attended Pembroke College at the same university. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher and evangelist who played a significant role in the Great Awakening."
