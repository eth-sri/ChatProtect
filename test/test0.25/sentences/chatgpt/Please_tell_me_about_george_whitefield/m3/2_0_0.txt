  "explanation": "No, the statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about his background and profession as an English Anglican preacher and evangelist. The only difference is that statement 2 includes the word \"cleric\" which is a synonym for \"preacher\". Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other."
