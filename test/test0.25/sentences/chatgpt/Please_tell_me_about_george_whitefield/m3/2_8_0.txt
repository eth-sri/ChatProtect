  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher who lived from 1714 to 1770. He was one of the most influential figures of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a preacher in the Church of England and quickly gained a reputation for his powerful and emotional sermons. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first time and began preaching to large crowds in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. Whitefield's preaching style was characterized by his ability to move his audience to tears and to inspire them to commit themselves to a life of piety and devotion. He was also known for his use of outdoor venues, such as fields and parks, to preach to large crowds. Whitefield's influence extended beyond the American colonies.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about his travels and preaching style, emphasizing his role in spreading the Great Awakening beyond the American colonies. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"thousands\" in statement 1, which is more specific than \"large crowds\" in statement 2. However, this difference does not contradict the overall information provided in the text."
