  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican preacher and evangelist who played a significant role in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. He was born in Gloucester, England, and attended Oxford University, where he became a member of the Holy Club, a group of devout students led by John Wesley. After his ordination as a deacon in the Church of England, Whitefield began preaching in London and quickly gained a reputation as a powerful and charismatic speaker. He soon became involved in the evangelical movement and began to travel extensively, preaching to large crowds in England, Scotland, and Wales. In 1739, Whitefield traveled to America for the first time, where he preached in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. His sermons drew huge crowds, and he became a celebrity in the colonies.",
