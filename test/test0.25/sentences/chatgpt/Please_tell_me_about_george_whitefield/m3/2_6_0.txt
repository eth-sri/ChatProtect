  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher who lived from 1714 to 1770. He was one of the most influential figures of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a preacher in the Church of England and quickly gained a reputation for his powerful and emotional sermons. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first time and began preaching to large crowds in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. Whitefield's preaching style was characterized by his ability to move his audience to tears and to inspire them to commit themselves to a life of piety and devotion.",
