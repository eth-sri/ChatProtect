  "explanation": "The statements about Love, Inc. (TV Series) are not contradictory. Both statements describe the premise of the show, which is about a group of dating consultants/matchmakers who work for a company called \"Love, Inc.\" and help their clients find love. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that the show is a romantic comedy, while statement 2 specifies that the show is set in New York City. However, these details do not contradict each other."
