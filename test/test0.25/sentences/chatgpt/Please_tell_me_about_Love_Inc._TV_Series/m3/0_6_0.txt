  "prefix": " Love, Inc. is a romantic comedy television series that aired on UPN from September 2005 to May 2006. The show follows the lives of a group of dating consultants who work for a company called \"Love, Inc.\" The consultants help their clients find love and navigate the ups and downs of dating. The main character is Denise Johnson, played by Busy Philipps, who is a dating consultant at Love, Inc. She is joined by her colleagues, including the charming and suave Clea, played by Holly Robinson Peete, and the nerdy and lovable Barry, played by Vince Vieluf. Throughout the series, the consultants deal with a variety of clients, from the shy and awkward to the overly confident and demanding. They also navigate their own romantic relationships, with Denise struggling to balance her career and her love life, and Clea dealing with the aftermath of a messy divorce. Despite positive reviews from critics, Love, Inc. was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.",
