  "explanation": "The statements about Love, Inc. (TV Series) are not contradictory. Both statements mention Clea trying to balance her personal life with her work at Love, Inc., but they focus on different aspects of her personal life. Statement 1 mentions Denise's struggles with her ex-boyfriend, which is a separate storyline from Clea's personal life. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
