  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the importance of traditional craftsmanship and materials in this style of architecture, and how it was a reaction against the mass-produced goods of the Industrial Revolution. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions the rejection of machine-made architecture, while statement 2 emphasizes the rejection of mass-produced goods in general. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that English Arts and Crafts architecture was a return to traditional craftsmanship and a rejection of industrialization."
