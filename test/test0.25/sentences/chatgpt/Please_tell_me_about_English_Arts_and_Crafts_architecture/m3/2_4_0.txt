It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made architecture of the Industrial Revolution, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and materials. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by a group of designers and architects who believed that buildings should be designed to reflect the natural environment and the needs of the people who lived in them. They emphasized the use of natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and the use of traditional building techniques such as hand-carving and hand-forging.",
