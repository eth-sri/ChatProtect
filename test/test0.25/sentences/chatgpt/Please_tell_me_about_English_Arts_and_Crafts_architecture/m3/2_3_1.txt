It was a movement that sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques, and to create buildings that were beautiful, functional, and in harmony with their surroundings. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by a group of designers, architects, and craftsmen who believed that good design should be accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy.",
