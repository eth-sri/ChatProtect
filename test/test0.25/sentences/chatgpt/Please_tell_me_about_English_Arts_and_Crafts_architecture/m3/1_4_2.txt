  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture was a movement that emerged in the late 19th century in England. It was a response to the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era, which many artists and designers felt had led to a decline in the quality of craftsmanship and design. The Arts and Crafts movement emphasized traditional craftsmanship, natural materials, and simple, functional design. Architects and designers sought to create buildings that were both beautiful and practical, with an emphasis on handcrafted details and a connection to the natural world.",
