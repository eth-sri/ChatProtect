  "explanation": "The two statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. In fact, they complement each other. Statement 1 explains the reason behind the emergence of this architectural style, which was a reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era. Statement 2 further elaborates on this by highlighting the focus on traditional craftsmanship and rejection of mass-produced goods that were central to the Arts and Crafts movement. Therefore, both statements provide a coherent and consistent description of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
