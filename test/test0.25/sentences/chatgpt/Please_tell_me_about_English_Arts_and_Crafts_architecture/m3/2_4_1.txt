  "alt": "Simple, functional designs emphasize the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.",
  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style that emerged in the late 19th century in England as a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made goods of the Industrial Revolution. It was a movement that sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques, and to create buildings that were beautiful, functional, and in harmony with their surroundings. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by a group of designers, architects, and craftsmen who believed that good design should be accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy. They rejected the ornate, decorative styles of the Victorian era in favor of simpler, more honest designs that emphasized natural materials and traditional techniques.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a list of features that are commonly found in this style of architecture, while Statement 2 highlights the emphasis on simple, functional designs that utilize local materials and traditional techniques. Both statements are consistent with the idea that English Arts and Crafts architecture sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and create buildings that were in harmony with their surroundings, while rejecting the ornate styles of the Victorian era."
