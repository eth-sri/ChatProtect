  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the same key elements of the movement, including traditional craftsmanship, natural materials, and simple design. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions the use of simple forms, while statement 1 emphasizes functionality. However, these are not contradictory ideas, but rather complementary aspects of the movement's design philosophy."
