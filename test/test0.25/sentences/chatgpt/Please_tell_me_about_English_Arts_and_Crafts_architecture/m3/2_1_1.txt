  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements describe the style as a return to traditional craftsmanship and materials, with an emphasis on hand-crafted details and techniques. The first statement adds that this style was a reaction against the mass-produced architecture of the Industrial Revolution, while the second statement emphasizes the use of traditional building techniques. However, both statements are consistent in their description of the style as a return to traditional craftsmanship and materials."
