  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the importance of designing buildings that are in harmony with their natural surroundings and reflect the needs of the people who live in them. The Arts and Crafts movement was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made architecture of the Industrial Revolution, and sought to return to traditional craftsmanship and materials. This emphasis on natural materials and craftsmanship was seen as a way to create buildings that were more in tune with the natural environment and the needs of the people who lived in them. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the principles of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
