  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era, and sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The style is characterized by its use of local materials such as stone, brick, and timber, and its emphasis on handcrafted details such as carved woodwork, stained glass, and decorative tiles. It also often features asymmetrical designs, steeply pitched roofs, and irregular floor plans. Some of the most notable architects associated with the English Arts and Crafts movement include William Morris, C.F.A. Voysey, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The movement also had a significant influence on the development of the American Craftsman style.",
