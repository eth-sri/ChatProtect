  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era, and sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and design. The style is characterized by its use of natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and its emphasis on handcrafted details and ornamentation. It often features asymmetrical facades, steeply pitched roofs, and prominent chimneys. English Arts and Crafts architecture was influenced by the Gothic Revival movement, as well as by the work of William Morris and his followers in the Arts and Crafts movement.",
