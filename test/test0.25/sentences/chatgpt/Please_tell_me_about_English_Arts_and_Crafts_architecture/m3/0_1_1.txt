  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the same aspect of the architectural style, which is its reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era. They also both mention the revival of traditional craftsmanship and techniques as a key feature of the style. While the wording of the statements is slightly different, they are essentially saying the same thing. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
