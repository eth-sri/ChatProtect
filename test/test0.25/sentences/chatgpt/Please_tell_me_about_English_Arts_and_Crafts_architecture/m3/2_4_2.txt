  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style that emerged in the late 19th century in England as a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made goods of the Industrial Revolution. It was a movement that sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques, and to create buildings that were beautiful, functional, and in harmony with their surroundings. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by a group of designers, architects, and craftsmen who believed that good design should be accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy. They rejected the ornate, decorative styles of the Victorian era in favor of simpler, more honest designs that emphasized natural materials and traditional techniques.",
