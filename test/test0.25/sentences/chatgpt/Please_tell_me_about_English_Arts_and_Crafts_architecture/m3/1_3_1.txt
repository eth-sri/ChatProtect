  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture was a movement that emerged in the late 19th century in England.

  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains the overall goal of the movement, which was to create buildings that were both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Statement 2 provides specific examples of the design elements commonly used in Arts and Crafts architecture, such as steeply pitched roofs and decorative details. Both statements support the idea that the movement emphasized traditional craftsmanship and natural materials in building design."
