  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made architecture of the Industrial Revolution, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and materials. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by a group of designers and architects who believed that buildings should be designed to reflect the natural environment and the needs of the people who lived in them. They emphasized the use of natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and the use of traditional building techniques such as hand-carving and hand-forging. English Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by a number of features, including steeply pitched roofs, asymmetrical facades, and the use of decorative elements such as exposed timber framing, leaded glass windows, and decorative brickwork. The interiors of Arts and Crafts buildings are often characterized by open-plan living spaces, exposed beams, and natural materials such as wood and stone.",
