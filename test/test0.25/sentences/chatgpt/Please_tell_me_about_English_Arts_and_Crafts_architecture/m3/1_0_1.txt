  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements provide complementary information about the movement, with the first statement introducing the topic and the second statement elaborating on the goals and principles of the movement. The emergence of the movement in the late 19th century and its focus on reviving traditional craftsmanship and creating functional yet beautiful buildings are both key aspects of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
