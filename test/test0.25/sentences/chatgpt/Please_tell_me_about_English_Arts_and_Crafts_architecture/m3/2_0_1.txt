  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements provide complementary information about the style of architecture, with the first statement giving a brief overview of its emergence and the second statement elaborating on its defining characteristics. The rejection of industrialization mentioned in the second statement is actually in line with the traditional craftsmanship emphasized in the first statement. Therefore, the two statements work together to provide a more complete understanding of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
