  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in the late 19th century in England. It was a reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era, and sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and techniques. The style is characterized by its use of natural materials, such as stone, wood, and brick, and its emphasis on handcrafted details and ornamentation. It often features asymmetrical designs, steeply pitched roofs, and prominent chimneys. English Arts and Crafts architecture was influenced by the Gothic Revival movement, as well as the Arts and Crafts movement, which sought to elevate the status of craftspeople and promote the value of handmade goods.",
