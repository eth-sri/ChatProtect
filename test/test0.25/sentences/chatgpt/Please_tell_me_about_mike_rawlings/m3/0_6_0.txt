  "explanation": "The statements about Mike Rawlings are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Rawlings entered politics in 2011 and became the mayor of Dallas. The only difference is in the wording - the first statement says he \"ran for mayor\" while the second statement says he was \"elected as the mayor.\" However, both statements convey the same information and are consistent with each other."
