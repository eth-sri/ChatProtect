  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Rawlings did not seek a third term in 2019, while Statement 2 says that he was re-elected as mayor of Dallas in 2015. If he was re-elected in 2015, it would imply that he served until 2019, which contradicts Statement 1."
