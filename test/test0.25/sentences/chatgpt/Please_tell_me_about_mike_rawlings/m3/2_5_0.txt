  "explanation": "The statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Rawlings served as the CEO of the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau from 2003 to 2004, while Statement 2 suggests that he served in that role before becoming the mayor of Dallas. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, so they are contradictory."
