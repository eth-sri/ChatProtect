  "explanation": "The two statements about Mike Rawlings are not contradictory. They both state that he was re-elected as the mayor of Dallas in 2015, which is consistent with the fact that he served as the mayor from 2011 to 2019. The first statement simply provides a brief summary of his two terms as mayor, while the second statement specifically mentions his re-election in 2015."
