  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was credited with 150 aerial victories, which is a significant achievement and places him among the top-scoring fighter pilots of the war. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions that he was the fourth-highest scoring ace in the German Air Force, while statement 2 describes him as \"one of the top-scoring fighter pilots of the war.\" However, both statements convey the same general idea that Gollob was a highly successful fighter pilot during World War II."
