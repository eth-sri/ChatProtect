  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly states that Gollob joined the German Luftwaffe in 1936 and was trained as a fighter pilot. However, Statement 2 incorrectly suggests that the Luftwaffe was trained by Gollob as a fighter pilot, which is not true. The correct statement would be that the Luftwaffe trained Gollob as a fighter pilot."
