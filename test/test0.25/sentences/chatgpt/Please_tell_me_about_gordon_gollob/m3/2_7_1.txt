  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. They both state that he was captured by the Allies after the war and spent time as a prisoner of war. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he was captured by the British and held until 1947, while statement 1 does not specify which Allied forces captured him or how long he was held."
