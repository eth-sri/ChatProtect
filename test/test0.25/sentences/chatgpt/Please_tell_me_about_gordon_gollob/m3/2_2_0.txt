  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and became a squadron leader in 1939, while statement 2 says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1933 and became a fighter pilot in 1937. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when Gollob joined the Luftwaffe and what his role was at different points in time."
