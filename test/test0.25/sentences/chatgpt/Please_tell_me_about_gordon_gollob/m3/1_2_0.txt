  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. The first statement says that he joined the German Luftwaffe in 1936, while the second statement says that he joined in 1933. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when Gollob joined the Luftwaffe."
