  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1936, while Statement 2 says that he joined in 1933. Additionally, Statement 1 says that he quickly rose through the ranks, while Statement 2 provides information about his role as a fighter pilot. These inconsistencies suggest that the information provided in the two statements may not be accurate or reliable."
