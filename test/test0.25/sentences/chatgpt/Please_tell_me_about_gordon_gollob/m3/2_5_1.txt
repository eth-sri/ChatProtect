  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. They both state that he was captured by the Allies after the war and held as a prisoner of war for several years. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he was captured by the British in May 1945 and released in 1947, while statement 1 does not provide specific dates or which Allied forces captured him."
