He was credited with 150 aerial victories, making him the fourth-highest scoring ace in the German Air Force. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his achievements. Gollob was known for his aggressive flying style and his willingness to take risks.
