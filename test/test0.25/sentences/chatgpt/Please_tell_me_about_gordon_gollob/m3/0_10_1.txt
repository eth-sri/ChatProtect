  "prefix": " Gordon Gollob was a German fighter pilot during World War II. He was born on June 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria. Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and quickly rose through the ranks. He became a fighter pilot in 1938 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77) in 1939. During the war, Gollob became one of the most successful fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe. He was credited with 150 aerial victories, making him the fourth-highest scoring ace in the German Air Force. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his achievements. Gollob was known for his aggressive flying style and his willingness to take risks. He was also known for his outspokenness and his criticism of the German high command. He was eventually relieved of his command in 1944 after a series of disagreements with his superiors.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was captured after the war and held as a prisoner of war. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he was captured by the British in May 1945 and released in 1947, while statement 1 does not mention the specific captors or release date. However, both statements are consistent in their overall message about Gollob's post-war captivity."
