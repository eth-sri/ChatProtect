He became a fighter pilot in 1938 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77) in 1939. During the war, Gollob became one of the most successful fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe. He was credited with 150 aerial victories, making him the fourth-highest scoring ace in the German Air Force. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his achievements. Gollob was known for his aggressive flying style and his willingness to take risks. He was also known for his outspokenness and his criticism of the German high command. He was eventually relieved of his command in 1944 after a series of disagreements with his superiors. After the war, Gollob was captured by the Allies and spent several years in prison.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he worked as a businessman after being released from prison, while statement 2 says that he worked as a commercial pilot for Lufthansa. These two professions are different, and therefore the statements cannot both be true."
