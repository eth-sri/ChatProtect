  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was released in 1947 and went on to work as a businessman and consultant, while Statement 2 says that he was released when the war ended and returned to Austria. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when Gollob was released from captivity and what he did afterwards."
