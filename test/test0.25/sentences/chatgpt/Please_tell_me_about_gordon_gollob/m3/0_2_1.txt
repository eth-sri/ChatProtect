  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. They both describe his rapid rise through the ranks of the Luftwaffe during World War II. The first statement notes that he quickly rose through the ranks after joining in 1936, while the second statement specifies that he eventually reached the rank of Generalleutnant. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional information about Gollob's military career."
