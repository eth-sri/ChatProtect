  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory as they provide different information about his rank during the war. Statement 1 claims that he was promoted to the rank of Generalleutnant (Major General) in 1944, while Statement 2 states that he was promoted to the rank of Major in 1942. These two ranks are significantly different, with Generalleutnant being a higher rank than Major. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
