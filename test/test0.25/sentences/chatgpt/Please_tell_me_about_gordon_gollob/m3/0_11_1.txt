  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. They both provide information about his life after his release from captivity, but they focus on different aspects of his post-war career. The first statement mentions his work as a farmer and a businessman in Austria, while the second statement highlights his career as a commercial pilot for Lufthansa. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Gollob returned to civilian life after the war and pursued different occupations."
