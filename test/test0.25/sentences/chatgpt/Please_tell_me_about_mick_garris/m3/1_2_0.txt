  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mick Garris are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Garris began his career as a writer and producer for television shows, while Statement 2 suggests that he began his career as a publicist for the film industry. These two career paths are quite different, and it is unlikely that both statements could be true."
