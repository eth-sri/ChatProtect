  "explanation": "The two statements about Mick Garris are not contradictory. They both mention his frequent collaboration with horror author Stephen King and his adaptations of King's works for film and television. Statement 2 provides specific examples of the adaptations, while Statement 1 simply mentions the collaboration in general. However, both statements are consistent with each other and with the overall description of Garris as a filmmaker and writer in the horror genre."
