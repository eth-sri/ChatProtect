  "explanation": "The statements about Mick Garris are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that Garris is a prolific author, which is a different aspect of his career than his work in film and television. The second statement highlights his prominence in the horror genre, which is consistent with his work as a filmmaker, screenwriter, and producer in that genre. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and provide additional information about Garris's career."
