They both mention his prolific writing career in the horror genre, with statement 1 specifically mentioning his book \"Masters of Horror\" and statement 2 providing the full title of that book as well as mentioning another book he has written, \"Nightmare Cinema.\" Both statements are consistent with Garris being a writer and author in addition to his work in film and television."
