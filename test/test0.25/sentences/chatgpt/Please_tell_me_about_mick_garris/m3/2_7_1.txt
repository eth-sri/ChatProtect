  "explanation": "The statements about Mick Garris are not contradictory. They both mention his involvement in writing and editing horror anthologies, specifically \"Masters of Horror\" and \"The Best Horror of the Year.\" The only difference is that statement 1 says he has written and edited these anthologies, while statement 2 says he edited and contributed to them. However, both statements convey the same idea that Garris has been involved in the creation of these horror anthologies."
