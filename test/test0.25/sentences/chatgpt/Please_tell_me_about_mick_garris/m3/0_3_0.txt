  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mick Garris are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Garris began his career as a screenwriter, while Statement 2 suggests that he began as a publicist. These two roles are quite different, and it is unlikely that Garris started his career in both simultaneously. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
