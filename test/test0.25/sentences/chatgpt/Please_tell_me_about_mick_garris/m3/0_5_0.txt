They both provide additional information about his work as a director, specifically mentioning his involvement in directing episodes of popular horror television series. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"shows\" in statement 2 instead of \"series\" in statement 1, but this does not change the meaning or contradict the information provided."
