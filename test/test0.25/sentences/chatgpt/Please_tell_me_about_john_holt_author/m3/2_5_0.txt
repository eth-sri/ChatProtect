  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that traditional schooling was too rigid and focused too much on rote memorization and standardized testing, and that children would learn better if they were allowed to follow their own interests and explore the world around them. Holt's most influential book was \"How Children Fail,\" which was published in 1964. In this book, he argued that traditional schooling was actually hindering children's natural curiosity and love of learning, and that it was causing many children to become disengaged and disenchanted with education. Holt went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Teach Your Own,\" and \"Escape from Childhood.\"",
