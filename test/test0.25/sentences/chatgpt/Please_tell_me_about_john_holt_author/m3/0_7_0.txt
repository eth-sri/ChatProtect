  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was born in New York City and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he attended Yale University and later became a teacher in the public school system. Holt became disillusioned with the traditional education system and began to advocate for alternative approaches to learning. He believed that children should be allowed to learn at their own pace and in their own way, without the constraints of a rigid curriculum or standardized testing. In 1964, Holt published his first book, \"How Children Fail,\" which criticized the traditional education system and argued that children learn best through play and exploration. He went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Teach Your Own.\"",
