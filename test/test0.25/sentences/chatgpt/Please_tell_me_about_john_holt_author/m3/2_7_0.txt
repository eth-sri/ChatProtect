  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was born in New York City and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he attended Yale University and earned a degree in English. He then worked as a teacher in various schools in the United States and Europe. Holt became disillusioned with the traditional education system and began to advocate for alternative approaches to learning. He believed that children learn best when they are allowed to follow their own interests and passions, rather than being forced to conform to a rigid curriculum. He coined the term \"unschooling\" to describe this approach.",

Both statements mention that Holt wrote influential books on education, but the first statement provides a specific list of titles, including \"Teach Your Own\" (1981), while the second statement only mentions two of his books."
