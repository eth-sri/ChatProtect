  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was born in New York City and graduated from Yale University in 1948. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he worked as a teacher in private schools and later became a public school teacher in Colorado. Holt became disillusioned with traditional schooling methods and began to advocate for alternative approaches to education. He believed that children learn best when they are allowed to pursue their own interests and passions, rather than being forced to follow a rigid curriculum. He coined the term \"unschooling\" to describe this approach, which emphasizes self-directed learning and hands-on experiences. Holt wrote several influential books on education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981).",
