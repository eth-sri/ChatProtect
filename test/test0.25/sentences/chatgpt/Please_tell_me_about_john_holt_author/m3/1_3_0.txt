  "explanation": "The statements about John Holt are not contradictory. The first statement explains how Holt became disillusioned with traditional schooling methods and began advocating for alternative approaches to education. The second statement elaborates on how Holt became a leading figure in the homeschooling movement, which was one of the alternative approaches he advocated for. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Holt's contributions to education."
