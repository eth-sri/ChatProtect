  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that traditional schooling was often ineffective and harmful to children's natural curiosity and love of learning. Holt was a teacher himself, but became disillusioned with the education system and began writing about his ideas for reform. His first book, \"How Children Fail,\" published in 1964, criticized the traditional approach to education and argued that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and discover on their own. Holt went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Teach Your Own.\"",

The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes that Holt's work laid the groundwork for the modern homeschooling movement."
