  "explanation": "The statements about John Holt are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his belief that traditional schooling can be harmful to children's natural curiosity and love of learning. The only difference is in the wording and emphasis, with statement 1 focusing on Holt's beliefs and statement 2 emphasizing the subject of his criticism. Overall, both statements support the idea that Holt was a proponent of alternative education methods."
