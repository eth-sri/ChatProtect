He was born in New York City and graduated from Yale University in 1948. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he worked as a teacher in private schools and later became a public school teacher in Colorado. Holt became disillusioned with traditional schooling methods and began to advocate for alternative approaches to education.",

  "explanation": "The statements about John Holt are not contradictory. They both emphasize his belief that children learn best when they are allowed to pursue their own interests and passions, rather than being forced to follow a rigid or predetermined curriculum. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which uses the term \"predetermined\" instead of \"rigid.\" However, this does not change the overall meaning or message of the statement."
