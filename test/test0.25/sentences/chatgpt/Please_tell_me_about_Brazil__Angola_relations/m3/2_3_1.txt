  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are contradictory as they provide different figures for the exports from Brazil to Angola in 2019 and 2020. Statement 1 states that exports totaled $1.3 billion in 2019, while Statement 2 claims that exports totaled $1.5 billion in 2020. It is unclear which statement is accurate, and further research would be necessary to determine the correct figure."
