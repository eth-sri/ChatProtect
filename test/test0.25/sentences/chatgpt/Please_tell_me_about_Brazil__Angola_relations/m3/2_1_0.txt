Statement 1 highlights the strong cultural and historical connection between the two countries, while also acknowledging Brazil's importance as a trading partner for Angola. Statement 2 further emphasizes the economic relationship between the two countries, stating that Brazil is Angola's largest trading partner outside of Africa. Both statements provide different perspectives on the relationship between Brazil and Angola, but they do not contradict each other."
