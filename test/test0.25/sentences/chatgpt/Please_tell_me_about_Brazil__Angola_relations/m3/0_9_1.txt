  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long-standing relationship that dates back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers established a slave trade route between Angola and Brazil. Today, Brazil is Angola's largest trading partner and the two countries share cultural, historical, and linguistic ties. Economic relations between Brazil and Angola have grown significantly in recent years, with Brazil being Angola's largest trading partner. Brazil exports a range of products to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and chemicals, while Angola exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil. In addition to economic ties, Brazil and Angola have also cooperated in the areas of education, health, and culture. Brazil has provided scholarships to Angolan students to study in Brazilian universities, and has also sent medical professionals to Angola to assist with healthcare initiatives. However, the relationship between the two countries has not been without its challenges. In 2013, Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras was accused of paying bribes to Angolan officials in exchange for contracts. The scandal strained relations between the two countries, but they have since worked to repair the damage.",
