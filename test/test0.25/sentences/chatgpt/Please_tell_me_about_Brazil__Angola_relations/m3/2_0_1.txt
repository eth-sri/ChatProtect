  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. In fact, they complement each other. The first statement highlights the historical ties between the two countries, which were both colonized by Portugal. The second statement adds to this history by mentioning the transatlantic slave trade, which brought many Angolans to Brazil as slaves. Both statements show that Brazil and Angola have a shared past that has influenced their relationship over time."
