  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention Brazil providing scholarships to Angolan students to study in Brazilian universities. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions Brazil sending medical professionals to Angola to assist with healthcare initiatives, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the information provided in the text, which states that Brazil and Angola have cooperated in the areas of education, health, and culture."
