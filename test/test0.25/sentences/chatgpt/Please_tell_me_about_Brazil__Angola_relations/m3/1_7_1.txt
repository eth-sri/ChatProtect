  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight Brazil's provision of technical assistance to Angola in areas such as agriculture, health, and education. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions Brazil's support for Angola's efforts to promote peace and stability in the region, while statement 2 emphasizes that the technical assistance is part of Brazil's efforts to strengthen their bilateral relationship. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Brazil's involvement in supporting Angola's development and strengthening their relationship."
