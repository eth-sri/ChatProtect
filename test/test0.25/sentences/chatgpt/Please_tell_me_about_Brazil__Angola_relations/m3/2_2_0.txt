Statement 1 highlights the importance of trade in the relationship between the two countries, while Statement 2 specifies that the trade is mainly focused on oil, which is consistent with Angola being one of Brazil's top suppliers. Both statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of the relationship between Brazil and Angola."
