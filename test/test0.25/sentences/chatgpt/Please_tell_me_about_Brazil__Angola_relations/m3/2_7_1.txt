  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long-standing relationship that dates back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers established settlements in both countries. Today, Brazil is one of Angola's most important trading partners and has played a significant role in Angola's post-war reconstruction efforts. Trade between the two countries has been growing steadily in recent years, with Brazil exporting a range of goods to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products. Angola, in turn, exports oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil. In addition to trade, Brazil has also provided significant development assistance to Angola, particularly in the areas of health, education, and infrastructure. Brazil has also played a role in peacekeeping efforts in Angola, providing troops and support to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the country. Cultural ties between the two countries are also strong, with Brazil and Angola sharing a common language and a rich cultural heritage.",
