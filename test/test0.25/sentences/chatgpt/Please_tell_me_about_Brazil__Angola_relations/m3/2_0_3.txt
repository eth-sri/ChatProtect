  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the historical ties between the two countries that date back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers established settlements in both Brazil and Angola. The second statement further emphasizes the cultural and economic exchange that has occurred between the two countries since then. Therefore, both statements complement each other in providing a brief overview of the historical relationship between Brazil and Angola."
