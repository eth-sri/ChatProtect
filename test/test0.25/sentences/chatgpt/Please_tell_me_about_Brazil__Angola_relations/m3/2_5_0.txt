Trade is a significant aspect of the relationship between Brazil and Angola. Brazil is Angola's second-largest trading partner, with exports from Brazil to Angola totaling $1.3 billion in 2019. The main exports from Brazil to Angola include machinery, vehicles, and chemicals, while Angola exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both highlight Brazil's involvement in Angola's post-war reconstruction efforts, but use slightly different wording. Statement 1 uses the word \"significant\" to describe Brazil's role, while statement 2 uses the word \"important.\" However, both convey the same idea that Brazil has played a crucial role in supporting Angola's reconstruction efforts."
