  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long-standing relationship that dates back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers established settlements in both countries. Today, Brazil is one of Angola's most important trading partners and has played a significant role in Angola's post-war reconstruction efforts. Trade between the two countries has been growing steadily in recent years, with Brazil exporting a range of goods to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products. Angola, in turn, exports oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil. In addition to trade, Brazil has also provided significant development assistance to Angola, particularly in the areas of health, education, and infrastructure.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but they focus on different aspects of the relationship. Statement 1 highlights Brazil's involvement in peacekeeping efforts in Angola, while Statement 2 emphasizes Brazil's support for Angola's military and security forces. Both statements demonstrate Brazil's commitment to supporting Angola's development and stability, but they address different areas of cooperation."
