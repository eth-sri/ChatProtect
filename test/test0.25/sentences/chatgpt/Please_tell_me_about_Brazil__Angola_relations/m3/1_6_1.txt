In recent years, the two countries have strengthened their ties through diplomatic visits and agreements in areas such as education, agriculture, and defense. Brazil has also provided technical assistance to Angola in areas such as healthcare and infrastructure development. However, the relationship between the two countries has not been without its challenges. Brazil has faced criticism from human rights groups for its arms sales to Angola, which has been accused of using its military to suppress dissent and violate human rights.",
