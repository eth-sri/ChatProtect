  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the historical connection between the two countries that began with the Portuguese colonization of both Angola and Brazil. The first statement emphasizes the longevity of the relationship, while the second statement specifically mentions the slave trade route that was established between the two countries. Together, these statements provide a brief overview of the historical context of Brazil \u2013 Angola relations."
