  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the relationship between Brazil and Angola dates back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers established a slave trade route between the two countries. Statement 2 further supports this by stating that Portuguese colonizers established both Brazil and Angola as colonies in the 16th century. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the historical roots of the relationship between Brazil and Angola."
