  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are contradictory as Statement 1 mentions Angola exporting crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil, while Statement 2 does not mention any mineral exports from Angola to Brazil. Instead, Statement 2 mentions food products as one of the main exports from Brazil to Angola, which is not mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, the two statements provide different information about the main exports between the two countries."
