  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long-standing relationship that dates back to the 16th century when Portuguese colonizers brought slaves from Angola to Brazil. After Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, Brazil recognized the new government and established diplomatic relations. In recent years, the relationship between the two countries has grown stronger, with Brazil becoming one of Angola's largest trading partners. Brazil exports a variety of goods to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products, while Angola exports oil and diamonds to Brazil. In addition to trade, Brazil has also provided aid and technical assistance to Angola in areas such as agriculture, health, and education. Brazil has also invested in infrastructure projects in Angola, such as the construction of a hydroelectric power plant and a new airport. Cultural exchange between the two countries has also been significant, with Brazilian music and dance being popular in Angola, and Angolan literature and cinema gaining recognition in Brazil.",
