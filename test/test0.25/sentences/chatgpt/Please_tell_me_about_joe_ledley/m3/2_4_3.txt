  "explanation": "The statements about Joe Ledley are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he has played for the Welsh national team and earned over 70 caps, which is consistent. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions his role in Wales' run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016, while statement 2 mentions his participation in both the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. However, these are not contradictory as they are simply different ways of highlighting his international career."
