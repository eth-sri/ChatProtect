  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Joe Ledley are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions his historic run with the Welsh national team in the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, while statement 2 states that he is currently playing for the Australian club Newcastle Jets. These two statements cannot be true at the same time, as the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament took place before Ledley joined Newcastle Jets."
