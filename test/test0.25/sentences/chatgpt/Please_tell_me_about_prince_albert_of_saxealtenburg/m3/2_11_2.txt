He was born on April 26, 1819, in the town of Hildburghausen, Thuringia, Germany, and was the second son of Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg. In 1836, Prince Albert began his studies at the University of Bonn, where he developed an interest in the arts, sciences, and politics. He also became fluent in several languages, including English, French, and Italian. In 1839, Prince Albert met Queen Victoria for the first time when he visited England with his brother, Prince Ernest. The two fell in love and were married on February 10, 1840, at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. As Prince Consort, Albert played an active role in British politics and public life. He was a strong supporter of education, science, and the arts, and helped to establish several institutions, including the Royal Society of Arts, the Royal College of Music, and the Victoria and Albert Museum.
