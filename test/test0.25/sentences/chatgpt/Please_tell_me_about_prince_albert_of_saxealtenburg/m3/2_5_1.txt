  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was married to Queen Victoria on February 10, 1840, at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London. The only difference is that statement 1 adds the detail that the two fell in love before getting married."
