  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he had six children with Princess Marie of Prussia, including Ernst II, who succeeded him as the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which specifies that Ernst II succeeded Albert as the Duke. However, both statements convey the same information about Prince Albert's family and succession."
