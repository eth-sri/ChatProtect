  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he died in 1861 at the age of 42, while statement 2 says that he died on December 14, 1902, at the age of 83. These two statements cannot both be true, as they give different dates and ages for his death."
