  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg meeting Queen Victoria for the first time are contradictory. Statement 1 states that he met her in 1839, while Statement 2 claims that he met her in 1836. These two statements cannot both be true, so they contradict each other."
