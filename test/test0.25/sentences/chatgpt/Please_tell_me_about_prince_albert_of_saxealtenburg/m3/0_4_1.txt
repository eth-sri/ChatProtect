  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he fought in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, but statement 1 adds that he also served as a general in the Prussian army. Therefore, statement 1 provides additional information about Prince Albert's role in the war, but it does not contradict statement 2."
