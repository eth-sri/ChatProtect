  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. The first statement claims that he abdicated in favor of his son in 1900, while the second statement claims that he succeeded his brother as the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
