  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he had six children, including Prince Ernst II, who succeeded him as the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which specifies that Prince Ernst II succeeded his father, while the first statement simply states that he succeeded him without specifying the relationship."
