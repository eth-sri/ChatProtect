  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory as they provide different years for when he began his studies at the University of Bonn. Statement 1 states that he began his studies in 1836, while statement 2 states that he began in 1837. Only one of these statements can be true, and without further information, it is unclear which one is accurate."
