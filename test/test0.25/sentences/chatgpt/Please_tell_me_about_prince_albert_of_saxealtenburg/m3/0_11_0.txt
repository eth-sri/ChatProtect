  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he died in 1861 at the age of 42, while statement 2 says that he died in 1902 at the age of 83. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the date and circumstances of his death."
