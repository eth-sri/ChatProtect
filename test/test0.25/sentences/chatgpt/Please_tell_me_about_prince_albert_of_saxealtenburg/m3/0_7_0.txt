  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he ruled over Saxe-Altenburg until his death in 1902, with the first statement providing additional information about his age at the time of his death. The second statement specifies that he ruled as regent after the death of his brother in 1871, which is not mentioned in the initial text. However, this does not contradict any of the information provided in the text."
