  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements mention his interest in the arts and sciences, with statement 1 specifically stating that he developed this interest during his time at the University of Bonn, while statement 2 suggests that he had this interest from a young age. However, both statements are consistent in highlighting Prince Albert's passion for the arts and sciences."
