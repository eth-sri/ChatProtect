He was born on April 14, 1819, in Hildburghausen, Thuringia, Germany, as the second son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, the daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia and Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. They had six children together, including Ernst II, who succeeded his father as the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. Prince Albert was a military officer and served in the Prussian Army during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He was also a patron of the arts and sciences and supported the construction of several cultural institutions in Saxe-Altenburg. In 1871, Prince Albert's brother, Ernst I, abdicated as the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, and Prince Albert succeeded him. He ruled until 1900 when he abdicated in favor of his son, Ernst II.

Statement 1 says he was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in Altenburg, while statement 2 says he was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in the Friedhof am Glockenberg cemetery in Altenburg. These two locations cannot both be correct, as they are different places."
