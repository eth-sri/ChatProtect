  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Molla joined the Yesh Atid party in 2013, while statement 2 says that he joined the Labor Party in 2012 and served as a member of the Knesset until 2015. These two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different political affiliations during overlapping time periods."
