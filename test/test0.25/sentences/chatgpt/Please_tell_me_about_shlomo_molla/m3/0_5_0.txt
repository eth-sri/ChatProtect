He was born in Ethiopia in 1965 and immigrated to Israel in 1984 as part of Operation Moses, which brought thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Molla was a social activist before entering politics, working to promote the integration of Ethiopian Jews into Israeli society. He was elected to the Knesset in 2008 as a member of the Kadima party, becoming the first Ethiopian-born member of the Israeli parliament. During his time in the Knesset, Molla focused on issues such as immigrant absorption, education, and social justice.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his advocacy for the rights of Ethiopian Jews and other marginalized communities in Israel. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions Ethiopian Jews, while statement 1 includes other marginalized communities as well. However, both statements are consistent in portraying Molla as a champion for social justice and equality in Israel."
