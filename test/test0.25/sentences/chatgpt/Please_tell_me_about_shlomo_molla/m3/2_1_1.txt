  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about his background. Statement 1 specifies that he was part of a larger group of Ethiopian Jews who immigrated to Israel through Operation Moses, while Statement 2 simply states that he himself was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to Israel in 1984. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
