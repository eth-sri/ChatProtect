  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 indicates that he served as a member of the Knesset for two political parties, Kadima and Yesh Atid. This suggests that he was an active politician at some point in time. \n\nOn the other hand, statement 2 simply states that he is a former member of the Knesset, without specifying which parties he was affiliated with or for how long he served. This statement implies that he is no longer an active politician. \n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
