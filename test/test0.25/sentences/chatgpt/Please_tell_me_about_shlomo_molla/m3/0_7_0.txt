Molla was a social activist before entering politics, working to promote the integration of Ethiopian Jews into Israeli society. He was elected to the Knesset in 2008 as a member of the Kadima party, becoming the first Ethiopian-born member of the Israeli parliament. During his time in the Knesset, Molla focused on issues such as immigrant absorption, education, and social justice. He was known for his advocacy for the rights of Ethiopian Israelis and other marginalized communities in Israel. In 2013, Molla left Kadima to join the newly-formed Yesh Atid party, which he represented in the Knesset until 2015.",
