  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. The first statement specifies that he was born in 1964, while the second statement does not provide his birth year. Additionally, the first statement mentions that he immigrated to Israel as part of Operation Moses, while the second statement does not provide this detail. Therefore, the two statements provide different information about Shlomo Molla's background and immigration to Israel."
