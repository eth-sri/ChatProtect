  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory as they present two different career paths. Statement 1 suggests that Molla worked as a social worker and community organizer after serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, while Statement 2 suggests that he worked as a journalist before entering politics. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, indicating a contradiction."
