  "prefix": " C.T. Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist. He was born on November 14, 1883, in Boston, Massachusetts, and died on December 2, 1941, in Boston. Blackfan received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908 and went on to become a professor of pediatrics at the same institution. He was also a physician at Boston Children's Hospital, where he conducted groundbreaking research on blood disorders in children. One of Blackfan's most significant contributions to medicine was his discovery of the condition now known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a rare blood disorder that affects the production of red blood cells. He described the condition in a paper published in 1938, along with his colleague, Kenneth Diamond. Blackfan also made important contributions to the study of sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent. He was one of the first physicians to recognize the disease as a distinct clinical entity and to describe its symptoms and complications.",
