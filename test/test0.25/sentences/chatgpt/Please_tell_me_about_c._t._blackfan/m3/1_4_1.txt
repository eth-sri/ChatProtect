  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements discuss his work on anemia in infants and the treatments he developed for the condition. The first statement mentions feeding infants iron-rich foods as a treatment, while the second statement mentions the use of liver extracts. These treatments are not mutually exclusive and could have both been used by Blackfan in his research."
