He was born on December 4, 1882, in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. Blackfan is best known for his work on anemia in infants, which he studied extensively throughout his career. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron in their diets, and he developed a treatment for the condition that involved feeding infants iron-rich foods. Blackfan also made important contributions to the study of blood transfusions, and he was one of the first physicians to use blood transfusions to treat anemia in infants. He also helped to develop the first blood bank in the United States. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a respected teacher and mentor to many young physicians. He served as a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and was the director of the Children's Medical Service at Boston City Hospital.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan's death are contradictory. Statement 1 says he died on October 11, 1941, while statement 2 says he died on September 30, 1941. These two dates cannot both be true, so the statements contradict each other."
