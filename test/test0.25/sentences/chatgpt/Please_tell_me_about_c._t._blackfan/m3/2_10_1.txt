  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963) was an American pediatrician and hematologist who made significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of blood disorders in children. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. Blackfan's early research focused on the development of red blood cells and the causes of anemia in children. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron in their diet, and he developed a treatment for this condition using liver extracts. Blackfan also made important contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent. He was one of the first physicians to describe the characteristic sickle-shaped red blood cells that give the disease its name. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated clinician who cared for many children with blood disorders. He was known for his kindness and compassion towards his patients and their families. Blackfan was a member of the American Pediatric Society, the American Society of Hematology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. He received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 1950.",
