  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory. The first statement describes him as a hematologist, which is a medical specialist who focuses on blood disorders. The second statement describes him as a pathologist, which is a medical specialist who focuses on the diagnosis and study of diseases. While both specialties are related to medicine, they are distinct fields with different areas of expertise. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
