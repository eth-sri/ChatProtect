  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1963) was an American pediatrician and hematologist who made significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of blood disorders in children. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. Blackfan's early research focused on the development of red blood cells and the causes of anemia in children. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron in their diet, and he developed a treatment for this condition using liver extracts. Blackfan also made important contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent.",

Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
