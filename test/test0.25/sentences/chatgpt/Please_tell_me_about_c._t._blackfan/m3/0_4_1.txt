  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory as they attribute different accomplishments as his best known work. Statement 1 credits him with the development of the first successful treatment for pernicious anemia, while statement 2 credits him with the discovery of erythroblastosis fetalis. Both are significant contributions to the field of hematology, but they cannot both be his \"best known\" work."
