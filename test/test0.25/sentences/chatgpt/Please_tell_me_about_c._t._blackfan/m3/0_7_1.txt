  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1965) was an American pediatrician and hematologist who made significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of anemia in infants and children. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia, particularly in infants. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron, and he developed a treatment using liver extracts that was effective in treating the condition. Blackfan also made important contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent. He was one of the first researchers to describe the characteristic sickle-shaped red blood cells that are a hallmark of the disease. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated clinician and teacher.",
