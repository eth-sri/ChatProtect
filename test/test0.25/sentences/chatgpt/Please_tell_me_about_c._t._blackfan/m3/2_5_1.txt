  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory. The first statement mentions Diamond-Blackfan anemia, while the second statement mentions Blackfan-Diamond anemia. The order of the names is reversed, which suggests that they may be two different conditions. Additionally, the first statement states that Blackfan discovered Diamond-Blackfan anemia, while the second statement implies that the condition was named after him. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
