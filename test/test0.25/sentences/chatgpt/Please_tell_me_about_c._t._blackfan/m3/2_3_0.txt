  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he became a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School after receiving his medical degree in 1908, while statement 2 says that he received his medical degree in 1909. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
