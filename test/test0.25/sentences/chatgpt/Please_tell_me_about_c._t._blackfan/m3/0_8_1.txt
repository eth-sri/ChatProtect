He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1901. Blackfan's research focused on the study of blood and blood disorders, particularly anemia. He is best known for his work on the development of the first successful treatment for pernicious anemia, a condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12. Blackfan also made significant contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent. He was one of the first physicians to describe the clinical features of the disease and to recognize its hereditary nature. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated clinician and teacher.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, but the first statement adds that he also served as the chief of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Boston. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about Blackfan's career."
