He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency of iron in their diets, and he developed a treatment for the condition that involved feeding infants iron-rich foods. Blackfan also made important contributions to the study of blood transfusions, and he was one of the first physicians to use blood transfusions to treat anemia in infants. He also helped to develop the first blood bank in the United States.",
