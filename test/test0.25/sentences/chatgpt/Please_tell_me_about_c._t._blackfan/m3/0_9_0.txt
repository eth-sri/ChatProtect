He is best known for his work on the development of the first successful treatment for pernicious anemia, a condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12. Blackfan also made significant contributions to the understanding of sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent.

In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated clinician and teacher. He served as the chief of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Boston and was a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.",
