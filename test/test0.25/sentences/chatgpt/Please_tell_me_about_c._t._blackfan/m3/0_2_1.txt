  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about C.T. Blackfan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1901, while statement 2 says that he graduated in 1902. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the same event. Therefore, they are contradictory."
