  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Cl\u00e9singer's early works were influenced by neoclassicism, but he later developed a more naturalistic approach. Statement 2 simply states that his early works were influenced by neoclassicism without mentioning any later developments. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
