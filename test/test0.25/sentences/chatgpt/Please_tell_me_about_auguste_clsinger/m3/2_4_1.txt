He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by Pradier's neoclassical style, but he later developed his own unique style that was more expressive and emotional. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" (La Femme piqu\u00e9e par un serpent), which was created in 1847.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements are describing the same sculpture, \"Woman bitten by a serpent\", and provide different details about it. Statement 1 describes the physical depiction of the sculpture, while statement 2 provides a symbolic interpretation of the serpent biting the woman's breast. Both statements complement each other and provide a fuller understanding of Cl\u00e9singer's work."
