  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who is best known for his works in the Romantic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by Pradier's neoclassical style, but he later developed his own unique style that was more expressive and emotional. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" (La Femme piqu\u00e9e par un serpent), which was created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a naked woman writhing in pain as a serpent bites her breast.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" caused controversy when it was first exhibited due to its erotic subject matter. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that the work was also seen as scandalous, while statement 2 focuses solely on the eroticism of the sculpture."
