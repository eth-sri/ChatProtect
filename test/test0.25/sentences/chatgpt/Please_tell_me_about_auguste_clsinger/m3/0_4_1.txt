He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later developed a more naturalistic approach to sculpture. He was particularly interested in the female form, and many of his works depict women in various states of undress or in sensual poses.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but they differ in their description of the woman in his famous sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake.\" Statement 1 describes the woman as being in pain as the snake bites her breast, while Statement 2 describes her as being in a dramatic pose with the snake wrapped around her body. Both statements are accurate in their own way and provide different perspectives on the sculpture."
