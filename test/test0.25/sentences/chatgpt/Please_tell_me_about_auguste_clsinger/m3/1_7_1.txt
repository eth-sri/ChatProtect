He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He began his career as a painter, but later turned to sculpture. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" which was inspired by the Greek myth of Laocoon. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it depicted a naked woman in a sensual pose. The controversy only increased when it was revealed that the model for the sculpture was Cl\u00e9singer's mistress, the famous French writer George Sand. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, which were highly realistic and captured the character of his subjects.",
