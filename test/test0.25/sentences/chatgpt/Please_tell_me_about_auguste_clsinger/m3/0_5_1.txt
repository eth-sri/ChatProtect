  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and sensual depictions of the human form. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later developed a more naturalistic approach to sculpture. He was particularly interested in the female form, and many of his works depict women in various states of undress or in sensual poses. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts a naked woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake\" was eventually removed from public view, while statement 2 provides additional context by explaining that it caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its erotic subject matter. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the sculpture was controversial and faced backlash."
