He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He began his career as a painter, but later turned to sculpture. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" which was inspired by the Greek myth of Laocoon. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it depicted a naked woman in a sensual pose.",

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the model for the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" was Cl\u00e9singer's mistress, the famous French writer George Sand, while statement 2 claims that the model was Apollonie Sabatier. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, therefore they are contradictory."
