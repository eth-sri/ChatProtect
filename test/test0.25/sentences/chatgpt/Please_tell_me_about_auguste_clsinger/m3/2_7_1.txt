  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and naturalistic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later shifted towards a more realistic approach. He was particularly interested in the human form and often depicted his subjects in a naturalistic manner, with an emphasis on the details of their anatomy and expression. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which was inspired by a story from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast. The work caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it was seen as scandalous and erotic.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements highlight Cl\u00e9singer's ability to create highly realistic and individualized depictions of his subjects, whether through his portraits or his sculptures. They both emphasize his focus on capturing the details of anatomy and expression, which contributed to his reputation as a naturalistic artist."
