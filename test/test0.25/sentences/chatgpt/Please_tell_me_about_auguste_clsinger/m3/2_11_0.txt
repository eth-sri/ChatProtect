  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and naturalistic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later shifted towards a more realistic approach. He was particularly interested in the human form and often depicted his subjects in a naturalistic manner, with an emphasis on the details of their anatomy and expression. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which was inspired by a story from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast. The work caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it was seen as scandalous and erotic. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, which were highly realistic and captured the individuality of his subjects. He received numerous commissions for public monuments and sculptures, including a statue of Napoleon III for the city of Lyon. In addition to his work as a sculptor, Cl\u00e9singer was also a writer and a political activist. He was a member of the Paris Commune in 1871 and was briefly imprisoned for his involvement.",
