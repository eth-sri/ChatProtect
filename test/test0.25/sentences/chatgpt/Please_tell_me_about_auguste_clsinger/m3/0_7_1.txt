  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and sensual depictions of the human form. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later developed a more naturalistic approach to sculpture. He was particularly interested in the female form, and many of his works depict women in various states of undress or in sensual poses. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts a naked woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast. The sculpture caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in 1847, and it was eventually removed from public view. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, including a bust of the composer Hector Berlioz and a statue of the writer George Sand.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that he was married to George Sand's daughter, Solange, and they had two children together. The second statement adds that one of their children, a daughter named Jane, also became a sculptor. Both statements provide additional information about Cl\u00e9singer's personal life and family, but they do not contradict each other."
