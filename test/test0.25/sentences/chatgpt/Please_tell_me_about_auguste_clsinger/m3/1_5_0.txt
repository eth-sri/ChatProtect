  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and naturalistic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He began his career as a painter, but later turned to sculpture. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" which was inspired by the Greek myth of Laocoon. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it depicted a naked woman in a sensual pose.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the controversy surrounding his famous sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" specifically that the model for the sculpture was his mistress, the writer George Sand. The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the word \"famous\" before George Sand's name in statement 1."
