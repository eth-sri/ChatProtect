  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Cl\u00e9singer developed his own unique style that was different from Pradier's neoclassical style, while Statement 2 suggests that Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by the neoclassical style. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
