  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and sensual depictions of the human form. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later developed a more naturalistic approach to sculpture. He was particularly interested in the female form, and many of his works depict women in various states of undress or in sensual poses. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts a naked woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements refer to the same sculpture, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and describe the controversy it caused when it was first exhibited in 1847. The first statement notes that the sculpture was eventually removed from public view, while the second statement explains that the controversy was due to the sculpture's erotic subject matter. Both statements provide additional information about the reception of Cl\u00e9singer's work and do not contradict each other."
