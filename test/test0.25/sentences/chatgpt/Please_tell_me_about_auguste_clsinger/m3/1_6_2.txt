  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and naturalistic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He began his career as a painter, but later turned to sculpture. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" which was inspired by the Greek myth of Laocoon. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it depicted a naked woman in a sensual pose. The controversy only increased when it was revealed that the model for the sculpture was Cl\u00e9singer's mistress, the famous French writer George Sand.",
