  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter who was born in Besan\u00e7on, France. He studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and became known for his realistic and expressive sculptures. Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement and often depicted mythological and historical figures in his work. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous sculptures is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts the Greek myth of Laocoon and the serpent. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847 because of its eroticism and realism. Cl\u00e9singer also created a number of other sculptures, including busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand. In addition to his work as a sculptor, Cl\u00e9singer was also a painter and illustrator. He worked for several publications, including Le Charivari and La Caricature, creating satirical illustrations and political cartoons. Cl\u00e9singer was married to the writer George Sand, and the couple had two children together. They were known for their unconventional lifestyle and were often the subject of gossip and scandal.",
