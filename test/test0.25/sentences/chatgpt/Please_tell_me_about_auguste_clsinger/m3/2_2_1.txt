  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. The first statement explains how Cl\u00e9singer's style evolved from neoclassical to a more expressive and emotional style, while the second statement highlights the influence of Italian Renaissance sculptors on his work. These two statements can coexist and complement each other, as Cl\u00e9singer's style could have been influenced by both neoclassical and Renaissance styles."
