  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who is best known for his works in the Romantic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied under the famous sculptor James Pradier. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were heavily influenced by Pradier's neoclassical style, but he later developed his own unique style that was more expressive and emotional. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent\" (La Femme piqu\u00e9e par un serpent), which was created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a naked woman writhing in pain as a serpent bites her breast. The work caused controversy when it was first exhibited, as it was seen as scandalous and erotic. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, which were highly realistic and detailed. He created busts of many famous people of his time, including Victor Hugo and George Sand.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. The first statement mentions his involvement in politics, which does not contradict the second statement about his membership in an art organization. It is possible for an artist to be involved in politics and also be a member of an art organization."
