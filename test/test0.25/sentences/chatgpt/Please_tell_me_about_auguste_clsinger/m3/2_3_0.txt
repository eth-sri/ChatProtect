  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but they provide different information about the same sculpture. Statement 1 simply mentions the title and creation date of one of Cl\u00e9singer's famous works, while statement 2 adds that the sculpture caused controversy due to its erotic subject matter. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
