  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, as they both refer to the controversy surrounding his sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent.\" They simply use slightly different wording to describe the nature of the controversy. Statement 1 emphasizes the nudity of the sculpture, while statement 2 emphasizes its eroticism. However, both statements agree that the sculpture caused controversy due to its sensual nature."
