  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight his skill in creating realistic sculptures, but the second statement adds that his sculptures were also sensual in nature. Therefore, the two statements provide different aspects of Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style without contradicting each other."
