  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different descriptions of his style as a sculptor. Both statements agree that Cl\u00e9singer was a French sculptor and that he was known for his realistic style. However, the second statement adds that his style was also sensual, which is not mentioned in the first statement. Overall, the two statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style."
