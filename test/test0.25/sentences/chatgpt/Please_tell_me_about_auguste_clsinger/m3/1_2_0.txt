  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather convey the same information in different ways. Both statements indicate that Cl\u00e9singer initially studied painting but later shifted his focus to sculpture. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 emphasizes Cl\u00e9singer's career trajectory, while Statement 2 emphasizes the sequence of his studies."
