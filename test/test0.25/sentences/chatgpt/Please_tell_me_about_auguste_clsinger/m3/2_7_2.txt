  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was known for his realistic and naturalistic style. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's early works were influenced by the neoclassical style, but he later shifted towards a more realistic approach. He was particularly interested in the human form and often depicted his subjects in a naturalistic manner, with an emphasis on the details of their anatomy and expression. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which was inspired by a story from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain as a snake bites her breast. The work caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it was seen as scandalous and erotic.",
