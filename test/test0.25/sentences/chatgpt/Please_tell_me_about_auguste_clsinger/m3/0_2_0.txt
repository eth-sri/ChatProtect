  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Cl\u00e9singer's early works were influenced by neoclassicism but later developed a more naturalistic approach to sculpture. The difference between the two statements is that statement 1 emphasizes the change in Cl\u00e9singer's style over time, while statement 2 highlights the reputation that his early works earned for their attention to detail and naturalism. Overall, the two statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Cl\u00e9singer's artistic development."
