  "text": "Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier during the Vietnam War who later became a journalist and anti-war activist. In 1969, he learned about the My Lai Massacre, in which American soldiers killed over 500 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women, children, and elderly people.\n\nDetermined to expose the truth, Ridenhour conducted his own investigation by interviewing fellow soldiers who had served in the area. He compiled a detailed report and sent it to the Defense Department, Congress, and the media.\n\nThanks to Ridenhour's efforts, the My Lai Massacre became public knowledge and led to the prosecution of several soldiers involved. Ridenhour received the Army Commendation Medal for his actions.\n\nAfter leaving the military, Ridenhour became a journalist and continued to speak out against the war in Vietnam. He wrote articles for publications such as the New York Times and the Nation, and he also authored a book called \"A Soldier's Sweetheart.\"\n\nRidenhour passed away in 1998 at the age of 52, but his legacy as a whistleblower and anti-war activist lives on.",
