  "text": "C.T. Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was an American physician who lived from 1883 to 1963. He is known for his research on blood and the discovery of the anemia disease in infants. \n\nDuring his career, Blackfan studied medicine at Harvard University and eventually became a professor there. He was also a member of the American Pediatric Society and the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. \n\nIn 1910, Blackfan made a significant discovery by identifying a form of anemia that affected newborn infants. The disease was later named after him and his colleague, Louis Diamond, and is called Blackfan-Diamond anemia.\n\nBlackfan also worked on understanding the causes of hemolytic disease in newborns, which occurs when a mother's antibodies attack her fetus's red blood cells. His research contributed significantly to the development of treatments for this condition.\n\nOverall, Blackfan's work in pediatrics and hematology made significant contributions to the understanding of blood disorders and the treatment of anemia in infants.",
