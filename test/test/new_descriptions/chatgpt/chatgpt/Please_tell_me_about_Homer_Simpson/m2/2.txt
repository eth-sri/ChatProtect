  "text": "Homer Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. He is voiced by actor Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on the show's debut episode \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" on December 17, 1989. Homer is the bumbling and lazy husband of Marge and the father of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. He works as a nuclear safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and is best known for his catchphrases \"D'oh!\" and \"Mmm... donuts.\" Homer is often seen as a lovable but flawed character, with a short temper and a penchant for overeating, drinking, and slacking off at work. Despite this, he is fiercely protective of his family and is willing to go to great lengths to keep them safe and happy. Over the years, Homer has become one of the most iconic and recognizable characters in popular culture, with numerous spin-off merchandise products and even his own Hollywood star on the Walk of Fame.",
