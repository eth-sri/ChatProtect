  "text": " Love, Inc. is an American television sitcom that aired from 2005 to 2006. The show starred French Stewart, Christine Lakin, and Jessica Lu. Clea's best friend and business partner is a fiery, impulsive woman named Denise (played by Jessica Lu). The show's premise centers around Clea and Denise's misadventures in their personal and professional lives. They frequently find themselves in absurd situations, often caused by their own poor decision-making. Clea's search for love and her struggles with commitment are a recurring theme throughout the series. Love, Inc. features a number of romantic interests for Clea, including her business rival, Luke (played by French Stewart), and a charming, albeit dim-witted, man named Lance (played by Jordan Bually). The show also features a supporting cast of characters, including Clea's eccentric mother, Lara (played by Anne Meara), and her goofy, yet lovable, assistant, Weddy (played by Robin Thomas). Despite its light-hearted tone, Love, Inc. tackles a number of serious themes, such as the complexities of relationships, the importance of family, and the challenges of finding true love. The show's humor is often campy and physical, with a focus on slapstick comedy and witty banter. Love, Inc. aired for two seasons on UPN (now The CW) before being cancelled due to low ratings. Despite its short run, the show developed a loyal fan base and remains a cult favorite among fans of sitcoms and romantic comedies.",
