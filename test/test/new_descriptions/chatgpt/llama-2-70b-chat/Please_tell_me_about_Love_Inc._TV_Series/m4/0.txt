Each episode features a new match for one of Fran's clients, often with comedic and sometimes disastrous results. Throughout the series, Fran also struggles with her own relationships, particularly her on-again, off-again romance with Paul. Love, Inc. struggled to find an audience and was ultimately canceled after one season.

Despite this, Love, Inc. has developed a small cult following in the years since its cancellation.",
