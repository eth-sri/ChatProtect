  "text": "Hellwegb\u00f6rden is a traditional German bread from the region of Westphalia. Hellwegb\u00f6rden is a dense, dark bread with a distinctive sour taste and chewy texture, made from a mixture of rye and wheat flour, water, salt, and sometimes caraway seeds or other grains. The dough is typically fermented for several hours before being baked, which gives the bread its characteristic flavor and texture. Hellwegb\u00f6rden is often served with hearty stews or soups, and is a popular accompaniment to Westphalian specialties such as Pak Choi and Knipp. It is also commonly served with a variety of cheeses and cold cuts. The bread is named after the Hellweg, a historic trade route that runs through the region where it is made.",
