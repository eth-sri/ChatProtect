During his time in office, he was a vocal advocate for the rights of Ethiopian Jews and worked to promote social justice and equality for all Israelis. Molla was also a prominent figure in the Likud party and held several positions within the party, including as a member of the party's central committee and as the chairman of the Likud's committee for immigrant absorption. He was known for his strong leadership and his ability to build bridges between different communities within Israel. In addition to his political career, Molla was also a successful businessman and owned several businesses in Israel. He was a proud advocate for Israeli-Ethiopian culture and worked to promote awareness and appreciation of the community's history and traditions. Despite his many accomplishments, Molla's career was not without controversy. In 2012, he was accused of fraud and forgery related to his business dealings, and he was eventually convicted and sentenced to prison. However, his legacy as a trailblazing politician and advocate for social justice continues to be celebrated by many in Israel and beyond.",
