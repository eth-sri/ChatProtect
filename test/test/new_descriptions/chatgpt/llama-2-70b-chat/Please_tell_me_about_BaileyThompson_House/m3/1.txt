  "prompt": "Please tell me about Bailey\u2013Thompson House",
  "text": "The house was donated. The house is a two-story, Queen Anne-style Victorian mansion with a Torreyson stone exterior and a slate roof. It features a wraparound porch, bay windows, and a projecting front gable. The interior includes a grand central staircase, ornate fireplaces, and original woodwork and moldings. The Bailey-Thompson House is significant not only for its architectural style but also for its historical association with the families who lived there. John G. Bailey was a pioneer settler of Kerr County and played a significant role in its development, while William H. Thompson was a prominent figure in Texas politics, serving as a state representative and senator. The house remains a well-preserved example of late 19th-century architecture and is a popular tourist attraction in Kerrville.",
