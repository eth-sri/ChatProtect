  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a constellation in the northern sky. It is one of the 12 constellations that were listed by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his 150-year series of astronomical works, the Almagest. Perseus is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is best known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing Andromeda from a sea monster. In the sky, Perseus is represented by a constellation that bears his name and consists of several stars and galaxy clusters. Mirfak is a star in the constellation of Perseus. Another notable feature of Perseus is the Perseus Cluster, which is a rich cluster of galaxies located near the constellation. Perseus is a circumpolar constellation, which means it can be seen from the northern hemisphere throughout the year. It is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, which is a pair of open clusters that are visible with binoculars or a small telescope.",
