  "text": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is known for his work on education and learning. He is best known for his book \"How Children Fail\" (1964), in which he argued that traditional methods of teaching were not effective in promoting real learning and that children should be given more freedom and autonomy in the learning process. He also wrote other books on education and psychology, such as \"The Learning Pyramid\" (1989), \"Mastery Learning\" (1982), and \"The Buffalo Wagon\" (1976). Holt believed that children should be taught according to their individual needs and abilities, rather than being forced to conform to a rigid curriculum. He also believed that children should be taught how to learn, rather than just being taught facts and information. He was a proponent of the unschooling philosophy.",
