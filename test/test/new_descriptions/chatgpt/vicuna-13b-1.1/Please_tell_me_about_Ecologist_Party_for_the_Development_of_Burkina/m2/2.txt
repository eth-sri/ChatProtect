  "text": "The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (Parti Ecologiste pour le D\u00e9veloppement de Burkina, PEDB) is a political party in Burkina Faso. The party was founded by a group of ecologists who wanted to promote a more ecologically sustainable and socially just development model in the country. The PEDB is committed to promoting ecological practices and protecting the environment, and it seeks to build a more equitable and democratic society that prioritizes the needs of marginalized communities. The party also emphasizes the importance of education, culture, and participatory democracy, and it seeks to create a more inclusive political system that allows for the full expression of citizens' needs and aspirations. In the 2012 and 2019 legislative elections, the PEDB won a total of three seats in the National Assembly, making it one of the smaller parties in the Burkinabe political landscape. However, the party has managed to build a significant presence in local governments, particularly in rural areas, where its ecological and development priorities have resonated with many voters. Overall, the PEDB represents an important voice in Burkinabe politics, and it continues to advocate for a more sustainable and just development model that prioritizes the needs of all citizens, especially those in marginalized communities.",
