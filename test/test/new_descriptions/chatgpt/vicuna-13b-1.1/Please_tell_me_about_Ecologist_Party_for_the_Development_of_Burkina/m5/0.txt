  "text": "The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (French: Parti \u00c9cologiste pour le D\u00e9veloppement de Burkina, PEDB) is a political party in Burkina Faso. The party was founded by Philom\u00e8ne Sawadogo. The PEDB is dedicated to promoting ecological values and sustainable development in Burkina Faso. The party's platform includes a commitment to protecting the environment, promoting renewable energy, and ensuring that natural resources are used in a sustainable way. In the 2020 Burkinab\u00e9 general election, the PEDB fielded candidates in several constituencies across the country, but none of its candidates were elected to the National Assembly. Sawadogo had previously served as Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development in the government of Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba, and had resigned from that position in March 2019 in protest against the government's handling of a border dispute with Mali. She did not garner enough votes to advance to the second round of voting in the 2021 Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election.",
