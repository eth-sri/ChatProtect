  "text": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an Anglican clergyman who played a significant role in the early days of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the American colonies. He was educated at Oxford University. Whitefield was a proponent of the evangelical movement, which emphasized the need for a personal relationship with God and the importance of living a life of holiness. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America as a missionary, and he quickly gained a large following due to his powerful preaching style and his passion for spreading the Gospel. He was particularly effective in reaching out to the colonists who were not affiliated with the established churches, and his itinerant preaching style helped to establish the concept of an \"evangelical circuit\" in the colonies. Whitefield was a friend and colleague of Jonathan Edwards and other prominent evangelical leaders of his time, and he played a key role in the growth and development of the Episcopal Church in America. He established the first Episcopal ministers' conference in 1743, and he was a strong advocate for the establishment of new churches and the training of new clergy. Whitefield was also a strong opponent of the slave trade and worked to educate the colonists on the immorality of owning slaves. He used his platform as a preacher to speak out against slavery and urged his congregants to treat their slave populations with compassion and kindness. Whitefield's legacy is still felt in the Episcopal Church today, and he is remembered as one of the key figures in the early history of the denomination in America. His passion for spreading the Gospel and his commitment to social justice continue to inspire many Christians today.",
