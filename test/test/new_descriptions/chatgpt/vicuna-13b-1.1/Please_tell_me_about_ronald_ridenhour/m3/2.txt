Ridenhour, who was not a professional journalist, investigated the events at My Lai and reported his findings to the US government, ultimately helping to expose the massacre and bringing attention to the issue of war crimes committed by US military personnel during the Vietnam War. His efforts helped lead to the prosecution and conviction of several soldiers involved in the massacre, and he was awarded the Bronze Star for his heroism.",
