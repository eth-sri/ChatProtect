Gollob's paintings are known for their attention to detail and their highly realistic depictions of aircraft. He often used photographs as reference for his paintings, but he also made detailed studies of the planes he was painting, sometimes even taking flights in them to get a better understanding of their characteristics. Gollob's work is highly regarded among aviation enthusiasts and collectors. Many of his paintings are on display in museums and private collections around the world.",
