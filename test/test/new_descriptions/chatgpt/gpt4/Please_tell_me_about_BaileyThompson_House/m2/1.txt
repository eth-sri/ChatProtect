  "text": "The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic residential building located in Delano, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1901 and is a two-story wooden structure designed in the Queen Anne architectural style. The house was originally constructed for William C. Bailey, a prominent businessman in Delano. The exterior of the Bailey-Thompson House is characterized by its distinctive red color with white trim, and a two-story bay window with ornamental woodwork. The interior features high ceilings, decorative wood trim, and multiple fireplaces. The home is a fine example of the craftsmanship and detail that was prevalent in affluent homes during the period. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, due to its significance as one of the few remaining examples of Queen Anne architecture in the area, as well as its connection to William Bailey, who played an important role in Delano's development. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House has been restored and is a beautiful representation of the Queen Anne style in a small-town context. It serves as a reminder of Delano's historic past, and the architectural and cultural heritage that is still present in the town.",
