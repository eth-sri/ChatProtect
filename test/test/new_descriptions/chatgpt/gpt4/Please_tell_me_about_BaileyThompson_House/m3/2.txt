  "text": "The Bailey-Thompson house was built in the Colonial Revival style. The house is significant for its architectural design and for its association with two prominent Memphis families, the Baileys and the Thompsons. The Bailey family, led by Napoleon Hill Bailey, was a prominent banking family in Memphis, who was involved in several successful businesses such as Bailey, Inc. (a retail business), Tri-State Motors, Inc., and the Tennessee-Pueblo Development Company. J. C. Thompson, the patriarch of the Thompson family, was the founder of the Thompson Realty Company and later served as president of the Memphis Real Estate Board. The house was sold to the Memphis College of Art. The Bailey-Thompson house is a two-story red brick building, featuring various decorative elements such as dentil moldings, cornices, and an elaborate entrance with a fanlight and sidelights. The structure is a fine example of the Colonial Revival style, which was popular in the United States in the first half of the 20th century. This architectural style drew inspiration from earlier colonial-era buildings, reflecting a newfound appreciation for America's architectural heritage. The Bailey-Thompson house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the house stands as a reminder of the city's rich history and architectural legacy, preserving the stories of the prominent families who once lived there.",
