  "text": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter, best known for his sculptures, particularly for his realist and sensual works. Auguste Cl\u00e9singer was born in Besan\u00e7on, France on October 22, 1814, and was raised in an artistic environment as his father, Georges-Philippe Cl\u00e9singer, was a successful painter. This early exposure to art influenced Auguste Cl\u00e9singer's decision to pursue a career in art. Auguste Cl\u00e9singer studied sculpture in Paris under the renowned sculptor James Pradier. He gained recognition for his early sculptural works that demonstrated his realist style and ability to depict human emotions. His big breakthrough came in 1847 with his controversial sculpture \u2018Woman Bitten by a Serpent,\u2019 which depicted a nude female figure in the throes of suffering from a snakebite. Due to the sensual nature of the work, it garnered much attention and incited intense debate on the appropriateness of such realism in art. Cl\u00e9singer also dabbled in painting and created several notable pieces throughout his career, but he remained more renowned for his sculptural works. He also created funeral monuments and homages to various historical figures, such as those for Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, and Madame R\u00e9camier. Apart from his artworks, Cl\u00e9singer made headlines through his personal life as well. He married the daughter of the famous French novelist George Sand, Solange Dudevant, in 1847. The marriage was troubled and short-lived, ending in a separation in 1850. Cl\u00e9singer continued to work and exhibit his art in the Salons in Paris throughout the subsequent years, experimenting with both classicism and realism in his sculptures. However, his later works did not achieve the same level of success or notoriety as his earlier pieces. Auguste Cl\u00e9singer died in Paris, leaving behind an artistic legacy marked by controversy, sensuality, and the triumph of realism in French sculpture.",
