  "text": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer was a French sculptor and painter known for his romantic, sensuous, and controversial style. Born in Paris, he was the son of French sculptor Georges-Philippe Cl\u00e9singer and started off studying under his father until he later entered the studio of F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Desruelles. In 1843, Cl\u00e9singer debuted his works at the Salon de Paris, an annual national exhibition by living artists. His early works included busts and portrait sculptures, but he gained most renown for his sensual female figures. One such example is his 1847 creation, \"Woman Bitten by a Serpent\", which caused a scandal due to its provocative posture and lifelike quality. The piece showcased a reclining nude woman with the serpent biting her ankle, resulting in a mix of shock and admiration from the public and critics. Additionally, he produced several monuments and busts of famous personalities, such as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and Napoleon I. In his personal life, Cl\u00e9singer was known for his spirited and passionate nature. In 1847, he married Solange Dudevant. Their tumultuous relationship was filled with infidelity and public scandal. The couple eventually separated, and Cl\u00e9singer returned to Paris to focus on his art. Despite his controversial style, Auguste Cl\u00e9singer received several honors during his career, such as the Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1849 and the Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1867. He continued to create acclaimed works of art until his death in 1883, leaving a lasting impact on French art in the 19th century.",
