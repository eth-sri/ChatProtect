  "text": "The 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season was the 61st season of the top-level ice hockey league in Austria. It took place between September 1990 and March 1991. Eight teams participated in the league, including the defending champions VEU Feldkirch. After the regular season, the teams were divided into two groups for the final stage of the competition. In the final stage, the top four teams formed the upper play-off group and played six additional matches to determine the winner of the Austrian Championship. The bottom four teams played six additional matches to determine which team would be relegated to the second-tier league. EC KAC emerged as the winners of the upper play-off group in the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season. EHC Lustenau finished last in the relegation group. The Austrian ice hockey league, now known as the IceHL, has since evolved to be an international competition with teams from multiple countries, but the 1990-91 season was a prominent chapter in the league's history.",
