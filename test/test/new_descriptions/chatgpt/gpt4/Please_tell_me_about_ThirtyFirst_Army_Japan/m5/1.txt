  "text": "The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was a strategic formation of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was formed as part of the Japan's Southern Expeditionary Army Group responsible for the military operations in Southeast Asia and the South West Pacific. It was involved in multiple military campaigns, including the Burma Campaign against British, Commonwealth, and Chinese forces. In these battles, the Japanese forces attempted to invade India and destroy British positions, but instead suffered significant losses due to poor logistics, harsh terrain, and stiff enemy resistance. The defeat at Imphal and Kohima was considered one of the turning points of the Burma Campaign, forcing the Japanese to retreat and ultimately changing the course of the war in Southeast Asia. As the situation worsened for Japan, the Thirty-First Army struggled with a lack of supplies, food, and reinforcements. With the end of World War II in August 1945, the Thirty-First Army was disbanded, and its remaining troops were taken as prisoners by the victorious Allies.",
