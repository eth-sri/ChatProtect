  "text": "John Holt (1923 \u2013 1985) was an American author and educator who played a significant role in the progressive education movement and the homeschooling movement. He was a proponent of child-centered education and the \"unschooling\" approach, in which children direct their own learning according to their interests, without following a set curriculum. Holt attended Yale University, where he earned a degree. He pursued a career in teaching, eventually becoming an elementary school teacher at two private schools in Boston. Holt's experiences in the classroom led him to develop his educational philosophy, which centered on the idea that children had a natural curiosity and desire to learn that was best supported in a voluntary, flexible, and child-directed environment. He believed forced education and standardized testing did more harm than good and stifled children's growth and creativity. He penned several influential books discussing his ideas, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path for Education\" (1981). These books criticised traditional schooling methods and advocated for a more personalized approach to education in which children could direct their learning at their own pace. In the 1970s, Holt's focus shifted to the growing homeschooling movement, and he became an advocate for the rights of parents to educate their children at home. He founded \"Growing Without Schooling,\" a magazine dedicated to homeschooling, in 1977, which provided resources, support, and advice to parents and educators interested in the homeschooling movement. John Holt's work as an author and educator has had a lasting impact on both the progressive education movement and the growth of homeschooling as an alternative to traditional school settings. His ideas continue to influence modern educational practices, as more parents and educators recognize the value of a child-centered, flexible approach to learning.",
