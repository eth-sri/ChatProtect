Seguin was well known for his work in public education, teaching scientific concepts to a wide audience through television and radio. Throughout his career, he played a crucial role in promoting scientific thinking and fostering an interest in science in Quebec society. Born on June 9, 1922, in Montreal, Quebec, Seguin was the son of a postman and showed interest in science from a young age. Fernand Seguin completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry. He pursued postdoctoral studies at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris in France. Seguin's communication career began in 1950 when he started a French-language radio program named \"La Science en marche\" (Science on the Move) on Radio-Canada. He hosted several popular science programs on television, including \"B\u00e9cyk\" (1965-1969), \"Les samedis de l'histoire\" (1971-1975), and \"L'homme devant la science\" (1977-1981). These television shows were dedicated to simplifying complex scientific concepts and making them more accessible to the general public. He also authored books on biology and biochemistry, such as \"L'ABC de la biochimie\" (1952), aimed at encouraging popular understanding of scientific research. Besides being a prominent figure in public education, Seguin was also a dedicated researcher and university professor. He taught at the specialized Institute of Biochemistry at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and served as the head of the biochemistry department at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM) from 1969 to 1972. Fernand Seguin received several accolades for his work in popularizing science, including the Officer of the Order of Canada in 1988. His death marked the end of a career dedicated to both research and the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public. Today, he is remembered for his lasting impact on scientific education and his contributions to fostering a culture of curiosity and scientific understanding in Quebec.",
