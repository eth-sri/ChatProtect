  "text": "Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 \u2013 May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin. Albert was the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. Prince Albert focused on military studies to prepare for a career in the Prussian army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert studied in Leipzig and Geneva, focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. The couple had five children: Marie (1875-1938), Elisabeth (1865-1927), Margarete (1878-1962), Ernst (1871-1955), and Luise (1886-1979). Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family. Albert had disputes with his cousin Ernst over the family estate and finances. Albert chose to live mainly outside of Saxe-Altenburg, residing in Switzerland, Munich, and eventually in Bamberg. Despite his disagreements with his family, Prince Albert was known for his patronage of the arts and his interest in numismatics, or the study of coins, medals, and other forms of currency. Additionally, he was considered a philanthropist, supporting various cultural and charitable causes. Prince Albert died on May 22, 1902, and is buried at the Ducal Park Cemetery in Altenburg.",
