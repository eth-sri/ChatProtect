  "text": "Wen Tianxiang (1236 - 1283), also known as Wen Zhenming, was a Chinese poet, scholar, and politician during the Song Dynasty. He is best known for his loyalty and dedication to the Song Dynasty, even in the face of military failures and direct threats to his own life. Wen Tianxiang is considered one of the most famous heroes in Chinese history, and his writings, particularly his poems, have become an enduring symbol of patriotism and resistance to foreign aggression. Wen Tianxiang excelled in academics from a young age. In 1256, he passed the highest level of the Imperial Examination and began a career in the civil service. He reached the rank of Grand Councilor. Wen Tianxiang's loyalty to the Song Dynasty was tested when the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan invaded China in the late 13th century. In 1278, in the face of the invading Yuan forces, Wen was put in charge of defending the kingdom. Despite his best efforts, he was ultimately captured by the Yuan in 1279. Imprisoned but unbowed, Wen Tianxiang famously refused to submit to his captors, rejecting several invitations to serve in the Yuan government despite the threat of execution. He spent the last few years of his life in prison, where he continued to write poetry, including his most famous piece, \"The Song of Righteousness\" (Zhengqige), which exemplified his unwavering loyalty to the Song Dynasty. Wen Tianxiang's steadfast refusal to capitulate to the Yuan earned him widespread admiration and respect throughout Chinese history. In 1283, he was executed by the Yuan regime, and his death only served to further enhance his legend. Today, Wen Tianxiang is remembered as a symbol of resistance, patriotism, and loyalty in Chinese literature and culture.",
