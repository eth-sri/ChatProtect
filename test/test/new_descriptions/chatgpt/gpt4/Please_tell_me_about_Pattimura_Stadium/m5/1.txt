  "text": "Pattimura Stadium is a multi-purpose sports facility located in Ambon, Maluku, Indonesia. It is named after Thomas Matulessy, better known as Pattimura, a national hero in Indonesia who played a significant role in the history of the Maluku Islands. Built in 1980, Pattimura Stadium has received several upgrades over the years, including the installation of floodlights for nighttime games and the improvement of spectator facilities. Despite these improvements, the stadium has faced challenges related to maintenance and infrastructure, and there have been calls for further renovations or construction of a new facility in recent years. Overall, Pattimura Stadium remains an important center of social and sporting activity in Ambon and the larger Maluku region, serving both as a tribute to a local hero and as a shared space for community engagement and development.",
