  "text": "The 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg was held in Osaka, Japan from September 12 to September 14, 2003. The tournament saw the participation of 62 judokas from different countries. Nomura was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a seven-time world champion. Choi Min-Ho won the silver medal, making it his second consecutive world championships final appearance. The bronze medals were secured by Brazil's Jo\u00e3o Derly and Russia's Yuri Alvear. Derly defeated France's David Larose, while Alvear overcame Venezuelan Javier Guedez in their respective bronze medal matches. The 2003 World Judo Championships was a significant event, as it was the first major international competition after the International Judo Federation (IJF) had implemented new rules to make the sport more spectator-friendly. The new rules included reducing the duration of the matches, making them more fast-paced, and introducing a sudden-death golden score rule in case of a tie.",
