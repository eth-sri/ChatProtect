  "prompt": "Please tell me about Bailey\u2013Thompson House",
  "text": "The home is a two-story, Greek Revival-style building with a large central hall and six rooms on each floor. In 1891, the home was purchased by the Bailey family, who lived there for many years. During their ownership, they added a two-story wing to the rear of the home, doubling its size. In 1959, the Bailey family sold the home to the Thompson family, who subsequently donated it to the Tallahassee Junior Museum. The Bailey-Thompson House is now used as a historic house museum, showcasing the life and culture of the antebellum period in Florida. Visitors can tour the home and see original furnishings and artifacts from the mid-19th century. The museum also hosts special events and educational programs throughout the year.",
