  "prompt": "Please tell me about Bailey\u2013Thompson House",
  "text": "It was built by William G. Ponder, a prominent contractor in the area, for his family. The home is a two-story, Greek Revival-style building with a large central hall and six rooms on each floor. In 1891, the home was purchased by the Bailey family, who lived there for many years. During their ownership, they added a two-story wing to the rear of the home. In 1959, the Thompson family subsequently donated the home to the Tallahassee Junior Museum. The Bailey-Thompson House is now used as a historic house museum, showcasing the life and culture of the antebellum period in Florida. Visitors can tour the home and see original furnishings and artifacts from the mid-19th century. The museum also hosts special events and educational programs throughout the year.",
