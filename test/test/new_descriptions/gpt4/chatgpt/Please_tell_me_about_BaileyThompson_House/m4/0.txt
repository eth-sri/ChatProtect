  "text": "This two-story, Federal-style brick house was built in 1820 for Gabriel Bailey, a prominent member of the community who served as a state delegate, senator, and U.S. Congressman. The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico supported by four columns. The fa\u00e7ade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade. His descendants occupied the house until 1968. In 1970, the Bailey\u2013Thompson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historical significance as an example of Federal-style architecture and its association with Gabriel Bailey and George L. Thompson. Today, the house is privately owned and serves as a private residence.",
