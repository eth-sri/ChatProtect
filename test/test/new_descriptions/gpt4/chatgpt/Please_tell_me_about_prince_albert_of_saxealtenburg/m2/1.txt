He was educated at the University of Bonn. In 1843, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Karl of Prussia and a niece of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. The couple had three children: Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg, Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg, and Prince Ernst II of Saxe-Altenburg. Prince Albert served as a lieutenant in the Prussian Army and later became a captain. He was also a member of the German Confederation's federal assembly and served as an advisor to his brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1866, Prince Albert's brother helped to lead the pro-Austrian forces in the Austro-Prussian War, and Prince Albert himself was briefly exiled from Saxe-Altenburg as a result. However, he was able to return to his homeland after the war ended. Prince Albert died in 1902 at the age of 82 and was buried in the royal mausoleum in Altenburg. His son, Prince Ernst II, succeeded him as the ruler of Saxe-Altenburg.",
