Nomura was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a seven-time world champion. Choi Min-Ho won the silver medal, making it his second consecutive world championships final appearance. The 2003 World Judo Championships was a significant event, as it was the first major international competition after the International Judo Federation (IJF) had implemented new rules to make the sport more spectator-friendly. The new rules included reducing the duration of the matches, making them more fast-paced, and introducing a sudden-death golden score rule in case of a tie.",
