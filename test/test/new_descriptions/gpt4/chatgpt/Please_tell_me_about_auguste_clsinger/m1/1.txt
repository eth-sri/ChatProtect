  "text": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer was a French sculptor who lived from 1814 to 1883. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He was known for his realistic and expressive sculptures, which often depicted historical and mythological figures. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is his sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Serpent,\" which was inspired by the story of Adam and Eve. It caused controversy when it was first displayed in 1847 because of its sensual and erotic nature. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, which captured the likeness and character of his subjects. He created busts of famous figures such as the writer George Sand and the composer Hector Berlioz. In addition to his work as a sculptor, Cl\u00e9singer was also a member of the French National Assembly and played an active role in politics during the 1848 Revolution. He died in Paris in 1883.",
