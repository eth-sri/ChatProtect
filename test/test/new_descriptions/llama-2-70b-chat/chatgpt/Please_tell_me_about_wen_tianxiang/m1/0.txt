  "text": "Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a famous Chinese scholar, military leader, and loyalist who served as the chancellor of the Southern Song dynasty. He was born in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, during the reign of Emperor Lizong. Wen Tianxiang is best known for his unwavering loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty, which was in decline due to the relentless attacks of the Mongol empire. However, he was later accused of conspiracy and was banished from the court. Despite this setback, he refused to abandon his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty and organized a resistance movement against the invading Mongols. In 1278, Wen was captured by the Mongols and was executed in 1283. Before his death, he wrote a famous poem titled \"Inspection Tour of the South\", which expressed his love for his homeland and his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty. This poem is considered one of the greatest works of Chinese literature and has become a symbol of national pride in China. Wen Tianxiang is celebrated as a hero and a symbol of loyalty in Chinese history. He is often portrayed in Chinese films, novels, and other works of literature as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and oppression. His legacy continues to inspire Chinese people to this day.",
