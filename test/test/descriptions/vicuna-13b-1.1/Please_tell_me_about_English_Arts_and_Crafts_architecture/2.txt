  "text": "The English Arts and Crafts movement, which emerged in the late 19th century, was a reaction against the industrialization of society and the lack of attention to craftsmanship and traditional techniques in architecture. Arts and Crafts architects sought to recapture the essence of medieval craftsmanship and to promote the idea of harmony between the arts and crafts themselves, as well as between the building and its surroundings.\n\nArts and Crafts architecture is characterized by its use of simple forms, natural materials, and handcrafted details. Buildings were designed to be in harmony with their surroundings, with emphasis on the use of local materials and traditional construction techniques.\n\nCommon features of Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n* Simple, clean lines and forms\n* Use of natural materials such as wood, stone, and brick\n* Emphasis on craftsmanship and attention to detail\n* Use of simple, sometimes irregular, massing\n* Organic, curved lines and forms\n* Arts and Crafts style embraced traditional architectural forms such as gables, oriels, and porches\n* Use of decorative elements like textiles, ceramics and stained glass.\n\nArts and Crafts architects such as William Morris, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and Gustav Stickley were instrumental in the development of the movement. The style has had a lasting influence on the field of architecture and design, and many Arts and Crafts buildings are considered to be of great significance.",
