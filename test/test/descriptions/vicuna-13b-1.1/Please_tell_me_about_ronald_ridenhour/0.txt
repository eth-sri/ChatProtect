  "text": "Ronald Ridenhour was an American investigative journalist and activist who is best known for his work exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. In 1969, Ridenhour received a letter from a former US soldier who had witnessed the massacre and was deeply troubled by what he had seen. Inspired by this letter, Ridenhour began his own investigation into the incident, which led to the uncovering of evidence of widespread human rights abuses by US troops in Vietnam.\n\nRidenhour's work was instrumental in bringing the My Lai Massacre to public attention and led to a Congressional inquiry into the conduct of US forces in Vietnam. As a result of his efforts, several US soldiers were charged with war crimes and eventually convicted. In recognition of his work, Ridenhour was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970.\n\nIn addition to his work as a journalist, Ridenhour was also an advocate for human rights and social justice. He continued to investigate and expose human rights abuses around the world, and was involved in campaigns to support political prisoners and promote democracy. He was also an advocate for the rights of Vietnam veterans, and worked to help them receive the benefits and recognition they had been denied upon their return to the United States.\n\nRidenhour's legacy as a journalist and activist continues to inspire others to this day. His commitment to exposing the truth and promoting human rights has had a significant impact on American society and beyond.",
