  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a constellation in the northern sky, located between the constellations of Auriga and Taurus. It is one of the 88 modern constellations and was first defined by the Italian astronomer, Gian stuilio Casseopia in the 16th century. The constellation is named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, who is known for killing the Medusa and rescuing Andromeda.\n\nPerseus is a large constellation that covers an area of about 1094 square degrees and it is located within the bounds of the milky way, making it a great place to observe galaxies and other deep sky objects. Perseus is home to several notable astronomical objects, including the Perseus cluster, the Caldwell 65 star cluster, and the famous spiral galaxy, M31, also known as the Andromeda galaxy.\n\nPerseus is easy to spot in the sky, as it contains several easily recognizable asterisms, or patterns of stars, such as the \"Double Perseus\" which is composed of two stars that are relatively close to each other.\n\nPerseus is also home of the Perseid meteor shower which occurs every year between July 17 and August 24. This meteor shower is produced by debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle and it's one of the most popular and best-known meteor showers in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, Perseus is a constellation that is rich in cultural and astronomical significance, and it offers many opportunities for observation and study of celestial objects.",
