  "text": "Bailey-Thompson House, also known as the Bailey House, is a historic home located at St. Augustine, St. Johns County, Florida, United States. It is noted for its distinctive architecture and historic significance.\n\nThe Bailey-Thompson House was built in 1887 by Dr. J.T. Bailey, a prominent local physician and Civil War veteran. The house was designed in the popular Victorian-Italianate style and features a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade with a central entrance, arched windows, and a bracketed roof. It has a brick foundation and wooden frame, with a slate roof.\n\nThe house was later occupied by several other families, including the Thompsons, for whom it is named. In the early 1900s, the house was converted into a boardinghouse, and later served as a funeral home.\n\nToday, the Bailey-Thompson House is privately owned and has been restored to its original Victorian-Italianate style. It is a popular tourist destination in St. Augustine and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",
