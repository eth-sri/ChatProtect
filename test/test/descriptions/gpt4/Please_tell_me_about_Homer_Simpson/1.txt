  "text": "Homer Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the long-running American animated television sitcom \"The Simpsons.\" Created by cartoonist Matt Groening and voiced by actor Dan Castellaneta, Homer is the bumbling but lovable, overweight head of the Simpson family, which consists of his wife, Marge, and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.\n\nWorking as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer often displays comedic clumsiness, buffoonery, and a short attention span. Despite his ignorance, questionable ethics, and laziness, he has a strong love for his family and can show moments of profound insight and sentiment.\n\nHomer is famous for his catchphrases \"D'oh!\" and \"Mmm... donuts,\" both of which have been popularly associated with his character since the show's debut in 1989. He has appeared in countless episodes and storylines, interacting with the diverse and quirky residents of the fictional town of Springfield.\n\nThroughout the show's run, Homer has become an iconic figure in popular culture, symbolizing the typical American working-class father with a unique blend of humor and heart. His antics and personality have allowed him to remain a beloved character for over 30 years since The Simpsons first aired.",
