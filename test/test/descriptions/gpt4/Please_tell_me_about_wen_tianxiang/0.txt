  "text": "Wen Tianxiang (1236\u20131283) was a Chinese poet, scholar, and politician during the Southern Song Dynasty. Born in Luling, Jiangxi Province, he is well-known in Chinese history for his patriotism and unwavering devotion to his country during the invasion by Mongolian forces led by Kublai Khan, who would later establish the Yuan Dynasty in China.\n\nWen Tianxiang excelled in his studies and passed the prestigious Imperial Examination in civil service, which propelled him into an illustrious career in the government. He held several significant positions within the imperial court, including Grand chancellor (equivalent to Prime Minister), and played a crucial role in the Song Dynasty's defense against the invading Mongols.\n\nIn 1278, as the Southern Song dynasty was on the brink of collapse, Wen was captured by the Mongols and imprisoned. Kublai Khan, impressed with Wen's talents, tried to persuade him to join the Yuan Dynasty under Mongolian rule. However, Wen Tianxiang remained steadfast in his loyalty to the Song Dynasty, and he refused the offer. As a result, he was incarcerated for several years before being executed in 1283.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Wen Tianxiang composed many notable poems and other literary works expressing his unyielding patriotic spirit and commitment to his homeland. Of particular significance is his poem titled \"Passing Ling Ding Yang\" (literally, Crossing the Lingding Ocean), which has become a famous symbol of Chinese patriotism and admired for its profound message of loyalty, integrity, and resistance against foreign oppression.\n\nWen Tianxiang is now regarded as one of the great heroes in Chinese history and has been honored posthumously with the title Duke of Xinguo. His dedication to his country, exemplary character, and literary contributions have made him a revered figure and an inspiration to many generations of Chinese people.",
