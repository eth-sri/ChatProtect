  "text": "Perseus (constellation) is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus. It was among the 48 constellations listed by the ancient astronomer Ptolemy in the second century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.\n\nPerseus is bordered by the constellations Andromeda, Aries, Auriga, Camelopardalis, Cassiopeia, Taurus, and Triangulum. It is visible from most parts of the Northern Hemisphere in late summer and autumn.\n\nThe brightest star in the constellation is Mirfak or Alpha Persei, which is a supergiant star approximately 590 light-years away from Earth. Other notable stars include Algol, also known as Beta Persei, which is a famous eclipsing binary star system known for its regular changes in brightness.\n\nPerseus is also home to several interesting deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a cluster of galaxies about 250 million light-years away; the Double Cluster, which is a pair of open star clusters located 7,500 light-years away; and the California Nebula, a large emission nebula about 1,000 light-years away.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Perseus is the demigod son of Zeus and Danae. He is well-known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and saving Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus. The constellation represents the mortal Perseus holding the severed head of Medusa, while the constellation Andromeda represents the rescued princess.",
