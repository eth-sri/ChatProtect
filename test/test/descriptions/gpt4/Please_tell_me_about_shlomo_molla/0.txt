Born in a small village in the Gondar region, Molla underwent a dangerous journey with a group of other Ethiopian Jews, walking for two months through Sudan to reach Israel in 1984. Upon his arrival, he was granted asylum by the Jewish Agency.\n\nIn Israel, Molla faced many challenges, including integration into a new society, language barriers, and racism. Despite these hardships, he became an advocate for Ethiopian Jews and worked towards improving their situation in Israel. He studied Political Science and Public Administration at Bar-Ilan University, and later on pursued his Master's degree in non-profit management from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nHis political career began in the early 2000s when he joined the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors, advocating for Ethiopian Jews and working on issues such as education, employment, and housing. He later joined the Israeli Kadima Party, serving as a member of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) between 2008 and 2013.
