  "text": "Gordon Gollob (1912\u20131987) was an Austrian fighter pilot and military officer during World War II, who later served in the post-war Austrian Air Force. Born on June 26, 1912, in Vienna, Austria, Gollob joined the Austrian military in 1930 and after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, he was transferred to the German Luftwaffe.\n\nGollob served as a fighter pilot during the early stages of World War II and participated in the Battle of Britain, the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), and several other military engagements. He achieved great success and recognition as a skilled pilot, ultimately becoming one of the top-scoring fighter aces of the war. Gollob was credited with 150 aerial victories in over 340 combat missions, earning him numerous awards and decorations, including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds \u2013 one of the highest military awards of Nazi Germany.\n\nIn addition to his combat duties, Gollob also held various command positions within the Luftwaffe, ultimately being promoted to the rank of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) in 1943. In 1944, he was appointed as the Inspector of Day Fighters (Jagdflieger) in the Luftwaffe High Command (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) under Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring. However, in the closing months of the war, he fell out of favor with G\u00f6ring, leading to his dismissal from this position.\n\nAfter the war, Gollob was captured by the Allies and spent some time in a prisoner of war camp before being released in 1947. In the 1950s, he joined the newly formed Austrian Air Force, where he served until his retirement in 1970, including a period as a Senior NATO Liaison Officer. Gordon Gollob passed away on September 7, 1987, in Vienna, Austria.",
