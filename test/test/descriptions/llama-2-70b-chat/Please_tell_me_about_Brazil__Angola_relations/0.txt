  "text": " Brazil and Angola have enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. Brazil, which had supported Angola's independence movement, was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's sovereignty.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil provided significant economic and military aid to Angola, which helped the country recover from the damage caused by the civil war that followed independence. Brazil also played a key role in the peace negotiations that led to the signing of the Bicesse Accords in 1991, which helped to end the conflict.\n\nSince then, Brazil and Angola have maintained strong economic and political ties. Brazil is one of Angola's largest trading partners, with significant investments in the areas of oil, mining, agriculture, and infrastructure. In 2018, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited Angola, where he signed several cooperation agreements in areas such as trade, security, and education.\n\nCultural exchanges between the two countries have also been significant, with many Angolans studying in Brazil and a growing number of Brazilians visiting Angola for business and tourism. In 2019, the two countries signed a visa exemption agreement, which has facilitated travel between the two countries.\n\nOverall, the relationship between Brazil and Angola is a prime example of South-South cooperation, with both countries having benefited from their close ties and cooperation in various fields.",
