  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern hemisphere, named after the mythological hero Perseus. It is one of the 48 ancient Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy, and is still recognized as a constellation today. Perseus is situated near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga.\n\nThe constellation is home to several notable celestial objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a large galaxy cluster located approximately 240 million light-years away. The cluster is visible as a faint, diffuse patch in the constellation, and is made up of hundreds of galaxies that are held together by gravity.\n\nPerseus also contains several variable stars, including Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which is a binary star system that varies in brightness as the two stars orbit each other. Another notable variable star in Perseus is Mirfak, which is a yellow supergiant that pulsates and changes brightness over a period of several weeks.\n\nIn addition to its celestial objects, Perseus has also been the subject of numerous myths and legends throughout history. In Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Zeus and a mortal woman, and was known for his bravery and adventures. The constellation is said to represent the hero's figure in the sky, with his sword and shield visible as two bright stars.\n\nOverall, Perseus is a fascinating constellation that offers a wealth of celestial objects and cultural significance, making it a popular target for amateur astronomers and stargazers alike.",
