  "text": " The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was a formation of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed in 1944 in response to the Allied invasion of the Mariana Islands, and was tasked with defending the Philippines and other Japanese-held territories in the Pacific. The army was led by General Shunroku Hata, who was responsible for overseeing the defense of the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. After the defeat of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, the Thirty-First Army was largely disbanded, with some of its units being transferred to other formations or used as reinforcements in other theaters of the war.",
