It was formed on October 9, 1944, under the command of Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata, and was primarily stationed in the Philippines. The primary responsibility of the Thirty-First Army was to repel the anticipated invasion of the Philippines by the Allied Forces, mainly the United States. The army consisted of several divisions, including the 8th, 16th and 29th Infantry Divisions and the 1st, 2nd, 13th and 14th Independent Mixed Brigades. The units were either stationed in the Philippines or assigned to defend nearby islands. Due to various transportation issues, the Thirty-First Army suffered from a lack of organization and coordination, which severely limited its combat effectiveness.",
