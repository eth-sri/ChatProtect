  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army of Japan was a field army unit of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) that played a significant role during World War II, particularly in the South-West Pacific and Southeast Asian theaters of war. The army was formed on June 12, 1944, and was active until the end of the war in September 1945. Headquartered in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, the Thirty-First Army was encharged with defending the Philippines from the Allied Forces. The Japanese command, under General Tomoyuki Yamashita, was aware of the strategic importance of the Philippines, as it served as a crucial link between Japan's mainland and its occupied territories in Southeast Asia. By maintaining control over the Philippines, Japan hoped to ensure that the essential resources of rubber, oil, and other materials continued to flow into the Japanese empire. During the Thirty-First Army's activation, the situation for Japan had become increasingly dire as the Allied Forces, led by General Douglas MacArthur, began their campaign to recapture the Philippines.",
