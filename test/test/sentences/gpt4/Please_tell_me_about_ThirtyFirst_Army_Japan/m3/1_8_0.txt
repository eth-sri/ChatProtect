  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was a strategic formation of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on November 6, 1943, as part of the Japan's Southern Expeditionary Army Group responsible for the military operations in Southeast Asia and the South West Pacific. The Thirty-First Army was primarily stationed in Burma (present-day Myanmar) during the war, with its main objective being to protect and defend Japanese interests and territories in the region. It was involved in multiple military campaigns, including the Burma Campaign against British, Commonwealth, and Chinese forces. The most notable commander of the Thirty-First Army was General Renya Mutaguchi, who led the forces during the disastrous Battle of Imphal and Kohima in 1944. In these battles, the Japanese forces attempted to invade India and destroy British positions, but instead suffered significant losses due to poor logistics, harsh terrain, and stiff enemy resistance. The defeat at Imphal and Kohima was considered one of the turning points of the Burma Campaign, forcing the Japanese to retreat and ultimately changing the course of the war in Southeast Asia. The Thirty-First Army continued to fight in various capacities throughout the remainder of World War II, engaging in guerrilla warfare and defensive operations against Allied forces.",
