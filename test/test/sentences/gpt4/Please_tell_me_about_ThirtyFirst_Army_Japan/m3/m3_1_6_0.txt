  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was a strategic formation of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was responsible for military operations in Southeast Asia and the South West Pacific. It was involved in multiple military campaigns, including the Burma Campaign against British, Commonwealth, and Chinese forces. The forces were led during the disastrous Battle of Imphal and Kohima in 1944. In these battles, the Japanese forces attempted to invade India and destroy British positions, but instead suffered significant losses due to poor logistics, harsh terrain, and stiff enemy resistance. The defeat at Imphal and Kohima was considered one of the turning points of the Burma Campaign, forcing the Japanese to retreat and ultimately changing the course of the war in Southeast Asia.",
