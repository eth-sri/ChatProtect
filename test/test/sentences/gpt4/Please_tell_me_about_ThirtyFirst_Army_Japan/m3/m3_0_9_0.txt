  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was a major unit of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during World War II. The primary responsibility of the Thirty-First Army was to repel the anticipated invasion of the Philippines by the Allied Forces, mainly the United States. The army consisted of several divisions, including the 8th, 16th and 29th Infantry Divisions and the 1st, 2nd, 13th and 14th Independent Mixed Brigades. The units were either stationed in the Philippines or assigned to defend nearby islands. Due to various transportation issues, the Thirty-First Army suffered from a lack of organization and coordination, which severely limited its combat effectiveness. During the Battle of Leyte in October 1944, the Thirty-First Army was engaged in fierce fighting against U.S. forces led by General Douglas MacArthur in an attempt to retake the island. The Japanese forces were eventually overwhelmed, and the 16th Division was forced to retreat to Leyte's mountains, where they continued to resist until their surrender in September 1945. Following the Battle of Leyte, the Thirty-First Army continued to fight against the Allies in the Philippines, including the Battle of Luzon and the Battle of Manila in 1945. However, the continued advances of the Allied Forces, as well as the superior resources and combat capabilities of the United States, ultimately led to the defeat and disbandment of the Thirty-First Army by the end of the war.",
