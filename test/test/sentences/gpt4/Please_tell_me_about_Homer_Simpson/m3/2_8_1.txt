He lives in the fictional town of Springfield with his wife, Marge, and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Homer works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position he often neglects or mismanages, leading to comically dangerous situations. Homer is known for his love of beer, doughnuts, and junk food, and his frequent visits to Moe's Tavern. He has a close group of friends, including his dimwitted yet lovable neighbor, Ned Flanders, as well as Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, and Carl Carlson.",
