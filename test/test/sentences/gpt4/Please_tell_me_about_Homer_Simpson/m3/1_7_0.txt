  "prefix": "Homer Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the long-running American animated television sitcom \"The Simpsons.\" Created by cartoonist Matt Groening and voiced by actor Dan Castellaneta, Homer is the bumbling but lovable, overweight head of the Simpson family, which consists of his wife, Marge, and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Working as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer often displays comedic clumsiness, buffoonery, and a short attention span. Despite his ignorance, questionable ethics, and laziness, he has a strong love for his family and can show moments of profound insight and sentiment. Homer is famous for his catchphrases \"D'oh!\" and \"Mmm... donuts,\" both of which have been popularly associated with his character since the show's debut in 1989. He has appeared in countless episodes and storylines, interacting with the diverse and quirky residents of the fictional town of Springfield.",
