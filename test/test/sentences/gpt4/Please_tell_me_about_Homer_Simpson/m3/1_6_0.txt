Working as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer often displays comedic clumsiness, buffoonery, and a short attention span. Despite his ignorance, questionable ethics, and laziness, he has a strong love for his family and can show moments of profound insight and sentiment. Homer is famous for his catchphrases \"D'oh!\" and \"Mmm... donuts,\" both of which have been popularly associated with his character since the show's debut in 1989.",
