  "prefix": "Homer Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the long-running animated television series, \"The Simpsons.\" The show, created by Matt Groening, first premiered on the Fox network in 1989, and continues to air to this day. Homer is voiced by actor Dan Castellaneta. Homer is depicted as an overweight, balding, and somewhat dim-witted husband and father. He lives in the fictional town of Springfield with his wife, Marge, and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Homer works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position he often neglects or mismanages, leading to comically dangerous situations. Homer is known for his love of beer, doughnuts, and junk food, and his frequent visits to Moe's Tavern. He has a close group of friends, including his dimwitted yet lovable neighbor, Ned Flanders, as well as Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, and Carl Carlson. The ongoing series frequently parodies and satirizes various aspects of American life and culture, with Homer's character embodying many of the stereotypes and shortcomings associated with the \"average American.\"",
