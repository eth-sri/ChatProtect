Working as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer often displays comedic clumsiness, buffoonery, and a short attention span. Despite his ignorance, questionable ethics, and laziness, he has a strong love for his family and can show moments of profound insight and sentiment. Homer is famous for his catchphrases \"D'oh!\"",
