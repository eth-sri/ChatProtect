Eight teams participated in the league, including the defending champions VEU Feldkirch. The regular season consisted of a round-robin format with each team playing each other twice, resulting in a total of 14 games for each team. After the regular season, the teams were divided into two groups for the final stage of the competition. In the final stage, the top four teams formed the upper play-off group and played six additional matches to determine the winner of the Austrian Championship. The bottom four teams formed the relegation group and played six additional matches to determine which team would be relegated to the second-tier league. In the upper play-off group, EC KAC emerged as the winners of the championship, defeating SC Feldkirch, EC Graz, and Wiener EV to claim their 20th league title. In the relegation group, EC SV Spittal secured their position in the league for the next season, while EHC Lustenau finished last and faced relegation to the lower league.",
