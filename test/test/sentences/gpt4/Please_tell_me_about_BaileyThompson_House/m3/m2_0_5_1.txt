The house has a two-story columned portico and a central hallway floor plan, with four rooms on each floor. The house features interior woodwork details such as molded door and window surrounds and a wooden staircase. In 1867, the property was sold to George Thompson, who added some modifications to the house, including a water system and ornamental iron balcony railing. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until 1975.",
