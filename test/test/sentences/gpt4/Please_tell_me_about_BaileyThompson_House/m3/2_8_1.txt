  "prefix": "The Bailey-Thompson house is a historic residence located in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. It was built in 1922 and was designed by architect James Broadwell in the Colonial Revival style. The house is significant for its architectural design and for its association with two prominent Memphis families, the Baileys and the Thompsons. The Bailey family, led by Napoleon Hill Bailey, was a prominent banking family in Memphis, who was involved in several successful businesses such as Bailey, Inc. (a retail business), Tri-State Motors, Inc., and the Tennessee-Pueblo Development Company. The house was owned by the Bailey family until 1940 when it was purchased by the Thompson family. J. C. Thompson, the patriarch of the Thompson family, was the founder of the Thompson Realty Company and later served as president of the Memphis Real Estate Board. The house remained in the Thompson family until 1966 when it was sold to another local family. The Bailey-Thompson house is a two-story red brick building, featuring various decorative elements such as dentil moldings, cornices, and an elaborate entrance with a fanlight and sidelights.",
