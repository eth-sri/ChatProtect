  "prefix": "The Bailey-Thompson House, also known as Olivet, is a historic residence located in Huntsville, Alabama. Built in 1840 by planter and prominent landowner Thomas Martin Bailey, the house is an excellent example of antebellum Greek Revival architecture. The house has a two-story columned portico and a central hallway floor plan, with four rooms on each floor. The house features interior woodwork details such as molded door and window surrounds and a wooden staircase. In 1867, the property was sold to George Thompson, who added some modifications to the house, including a water system and ornamental iron balcony railing. The Bailey-Thompson House remained in the Thompson family until 1975 when it was sold to the McGahey family. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and is considered an essential part of Huntsville's 19th-century history.",
