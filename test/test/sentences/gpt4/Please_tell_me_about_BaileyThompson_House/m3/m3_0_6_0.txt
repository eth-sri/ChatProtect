  "prefix": "Built in 1840 by planter and prominent landowner Thomas Martin Bailey, the house is an excellent example of antebellum Greek Revival architecture. The house has a two-story columned portico and a central hallway floor plan, with four rooms on each floor. The house features interior woodwork details such as molded door and window surrounds and a wooden staircase. In 1867, the property was sold to George Thompson, who added some modifications to the house, including a water system and ornamental iron balcony railing. In 1975, it was sold to the McGahey family. The house is considered an essential part of Huntsville's 19th-century history.",
