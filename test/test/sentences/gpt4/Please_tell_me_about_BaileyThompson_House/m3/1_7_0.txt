  "prefix": "The Bailey-Thompson House, also known as the Red House, is a historic residential building located at 235 River Street in Delano, Minnesota, United States. It is a two-story wooden structure designed in the Queen Anne architectural style and built in 1901. The house was originally constructed for William C. Bailey, a prominent businessman in Delano. The exterior of the Bailey-Thompson House is characterized by its distinctive red color with white trim, and a two-story bay window with ornamental woodwork. The interior features high ceilings, decorative wood trim, and multiple fireplaces. The home is a fine example of the craftsmanship and detail that was prevalent in affluent homes during the period. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, due to its significance as one of the few remaining examples of Queen Anne architecture in the area, as well as its connection to William Bailey, who played an important role in Delano's development.",
