Born Diane Davis in California, she later adopted her pseudonym by combining the names of her children, David and Dana, with \"stone\" being a name she admired. Arkenstone began her music career in the late 1980s when she started composing and recording music in her home studio. Over the years, she has released numerous albums and contributed to many compilations. Her first solo album, \"The Divine Art of Living,\" was released in 1999. Her music is often characterized by lush soundscapes, with a blend of many world instruments, including Celtic harp, Native American flute, Chinese zither, and various percussion instruments. Along with her soothing vocals, her music often explores themes related to nature, spirituality, and fantasy. This has made her a popular artist in the New Age and Ambient music circles. In addition to her solo work, Diane Arkenstone has been involved in many musical collaborations. This includes working with her husband David Arkenstone on multiple projects like Adventure Cargo and Troika. She has also worked with other artists and composers, such as Jerry Goodman, Cusco, and David Miles Huber.
