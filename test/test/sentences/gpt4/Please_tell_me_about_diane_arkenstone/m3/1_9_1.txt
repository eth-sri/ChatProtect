  "prefix": "Diane Arkenstone is an American new age musician, composer, singer, and songwriter, born in the early 1960s in California, USA. She is known for her enchanting, melodic, and ethereal music that combines elements of world, Celtic, classical, electronic, and contemporary styles. Diane began her love affair with music as a young child; she learned to play the guitar at the age of 7 and started composing music by the age of 10. As she grew older, she experimented with a variety of instruments, such as the flute, keyboard, and percussion, and expanded her music repertoire. Arkenstone's professional career in music began in the late 1980s when she signed with the label Neo Pacifica Recordings. Her first solo album, \"The Divine Art of the Harp,\" was released in 1991. However, it was her second album, \"The Secret Garden\" (1998), that gained her widespread recognition and popularity both in the United States and internationally. In addition to her solo work, Diane Arkenstone has collaborated with different artists and bands. One notable collaboration was with her (now ex-) husband, David Arkenstone, and Enaid, wherein they released music under the name Earth Trybe.",
