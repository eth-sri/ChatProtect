He received his medical degree from Cornell University, and after finishing his internship, worked at the Babies Hospital of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. Blackfan's research predominantly focused on pediatric hematology and growth disorders. He, along with his colleague Dr. Louis K. Diamond, described a type of congenital hypoplastic anemia known as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia in 1938. The condition, which has an onset during the first year of life, is characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells, potential physical abnormalities, and an increased risk of certain cancers.",
