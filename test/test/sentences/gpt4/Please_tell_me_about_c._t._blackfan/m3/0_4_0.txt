Diamond and Dr. Kenneth Blackfan, who first described the condition in the 1930s. DBA is a congenital form of anemia that affects the production of red blood cells, leading to a decreased ability to carry oxygen throughout the body. Patients often experience fatigue, weakness, and difficulty in physical activities, as well as various physical abnormalities, including heart problems, kidney problems, and skeletal abnormalities.",
