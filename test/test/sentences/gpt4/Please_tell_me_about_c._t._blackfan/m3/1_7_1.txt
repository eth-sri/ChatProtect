He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1913. Blackfan is best known for his description of Blackfan-Diamond Syndrome (now known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia), a rare genetic disorder characterized by decreased production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. He first described the syndrome in 1938 alongside his colleague, Dr. Kenneth Diamond. Throughout his career, Blackfan worked at several prestigious institutions, including the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Pennsylvania. From 1932 until his death in 1941, he served as the Chief of Pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Boston. Blackfan's work and research covered a wide range of pediatric topics, including infant nutrition, growth and development, congenital heart diseases, and blood disorders in children.",
