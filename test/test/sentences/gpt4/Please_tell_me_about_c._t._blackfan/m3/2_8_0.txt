  "prefix": "Dr. Carl Thomas Blackfan (1889-1941) was an American pediatrician known for his contributions to the field of pediatrics and the description of the rare genetic disorder that is now named after him: Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. He received his medical degree from Cornell University, and after finishing his internship, worked at the Babies Hospital of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. Blackfan's research predominantly focused on pediatric hematology and growth disorders. He, along with his colleague Dr. Louis K. Diamond, described a type of congenital hypoplastic anemia known as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia in 1938. The condition, which has an onset during the first year of life, is characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells, potential physical abnormalities, and an increased risk of certain cancers. It usually results from mutations in ribosomal protein genes, leading to a defect in erythropoiesis (the production of red blood cells). Beyond Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, Dr. Blackfan made significant contributions to pediatric medicine, focusing on other hematologic conditions, growth disorders, and the impact of diet and nutrition on health. His name is associated with several medical terms and conditions, including Blackfan's sign (anemia in infants) and Blackfan-Diennes-Boxerman Syndrome, which occurs when consumption of a diet containing high amounts of phytate and calcium results in negative phosphorus balance.",
