Born on June 9, 1922, in Montreal, Quebec, he completed his Bachelor of Science degree at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 1944 and later earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the same institution. Seguin began his career as a researcher and worked at various institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris, and the Laval University in Quebec. However, he quickly realized the need to popularize science education to make it more accessible to the general public.
