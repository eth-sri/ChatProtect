  "prefix": "Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian biochemist, science educator, and television personality known for his influential work in promoting science education in the French-speaking regions of Canada. Born on June 9, 1922, in Montreal, Quebec, he completed his Bachelor of Science degree at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 1944 and later earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the same institution. Seguin worked at various institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris, and the Laval University in Quebec. However, he quickly realized the need to popularize science education to make it more accessible to the general public. Starting in the 1950s, Seguin turned to television and became a regular on Radio-Canada's youth educational programs. He was an exceptional communicator and managed to create a connection with both young and adult audiences, explaining scientific concepts in an engaging and understandable way. In 1960, he hosted the television show, \"Le Roman de la science,\" where he explained complex scientific problems using accessible language for viewers, making science both enjoyable and relatable.",
