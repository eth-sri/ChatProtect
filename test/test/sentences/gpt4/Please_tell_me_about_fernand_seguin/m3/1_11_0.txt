  "prefix": "Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Quebecois biochemist, educator, and popularizer of science from Quebec, Canada. Seguin was well known for his work in public education, using television and radio to teach scientific concepts to a wide audience. Throughout his career, he played a crucial role in promoting scientific thinking and fostering an interest in science in Quebec society. Born on June 9, 1922, in Montreal, Quebec, Seguin was the son of a postman and showed interest in science from a young age. He earned his bachelor's degree in science from Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry from Universit\u00e9 Laval in 1949. In 1953-54, he had pursued postdoctoral studies at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris in France and the University of Cambridge in England. Seguin's communication career began in 1950 when he started a French-language radio program named \"La Science en marche\" (Science on the Move) on Radio-Canada. Later, he moved to television, hosting several popular science programs, including \"B\u00e9cyk\" (1965-1969), \"Les samedis de l'histoire\" (1971-1975), and \"L'homme devant la science\" (1977-1981). These television shows were dedicated to simplifying complex scientific concepts and making them more accessible to the general public. He also authored books on biology and biochemistry, such as \"L'ABC de la biochimie\" (1952), aimed at encouraging popular understanding of scientific research. Besides being a prominent figure in public education, Seguin was also a dedicated researcher and university professor.",
