  "prefix": "Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Quebecois biochemist, educator, and popularizer of science from Quebec, Canada. Seguin was well known for his work in public education, using television and radio to teach scientific concepts to a wide audience. Throughout his career, he played a crucial role in promoting scientific thinking and fostering an interest in science in Quebec society. Born on June 9, 1922, in Montreal, Quebec, Seguin was the son of a postman and showed interest in science from a young age. He earned his bachelor's degree in science from Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry from Universit\u00e9 Laval in 1949. In 1953-54, he had pursued postdoctoral studies at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris in France and the University of Cambridge in England. Seguin's communication career began in 1950 when he started a French-language radio program named \"La Science en marche\" (Science on the Move) on Radio-Canada. Later, he moved to television, hosting several popular science programs, including \"B\u00e9cyk\" (1965-1969), \"Les samedis de l'histoire\" (1971-1975), and \"L'homme devant la science\" (1977-1981).",
