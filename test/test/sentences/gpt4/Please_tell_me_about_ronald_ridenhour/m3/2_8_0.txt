  "prefix": "Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 \u2013 May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran and investigative journalist, best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. The massacre, which took place on March 16, 1968, involved US Army soldiers killing hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. Ridenhour served as a helicopter door gunner with the 11th Brigade, Americal Division, but he did not participate in the My Lai Massacre. He first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers while in Vietnam, and after returning to the United States, he began his own investigation. Ridenhour gathered testimonies from other soldiers who had either witnessed or participated in the events at My Lai. In March 1969, Ridenhour compiled his findings in a detailed letter and sent it to 30 government and military officials, including US President Richard Nixon, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and numerous congressmen. His letter prompted an official investigation, which eventually led to the court-martial and conviction of Army Lieutenant William L. Calley Jr. for his role in the massacre. Ridenhour's actions in uncovering the My Lai Massacre earned him praise for his commitment to the truth and for challenging the culture of secrecy within the military.",
