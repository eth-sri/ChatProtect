He is best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour served in the US Army from 1967 to 1968 as a helicopter gunner and door gunner. While in Vietnam, he heard about the atrocities committed by US soldiers at My Lai from fellow soldiers. He was deeply disturbed by these accounts and took it upon himself to investigate the matter further, gathering eyewitness accounts and evidence. In March 1969, after returning to the United States, Ridenhour wrote a detailed letter describing the massacre and sent copies of it to 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, urging them to conduct an investigation.",
