  "prefix": "Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 12, 1946 \u2013 May 10, 1998) was an American investigative journalist, Vietnam War veteran, and whistleblower, best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its subsequent cover-up during the Vietnam War. He was serving as a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam when he first heard about the massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were brutally murdered by US soldiers on March 16, 1968. After returning from Vietnam, Ridenhour began an independent investigation into the event, interviewing soldiers who took part in or witnessed the massacre. In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai. His actions led to reports in the media and eventually to official investigations by the US military. The My Lai Massacre became a turning point in the Vietnam War, causing widespread outrage in the United States and internationally, and leading to a decline in support for the war among the American public. It also led to the prosecution of several high-ranking military officers, most notably, Lieutenant William Calley. Following his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, Ridenhour went on to become an investigative journalist, working for various news organizations and publications throughout his career. He also received the George Polk Award for his reporting on the My Lai Massacre. In 1989, the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the Nation Institute established the annual Ridenhour Prizes in his honor. The prizes recognize acts of truth-telling, whistleblowing, and defending the public interest by journalists and other individuals who, like Ridenhour, display courage in their actions.",
