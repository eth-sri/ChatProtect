  "prefix": "Ronald L. Ridenhour (April 6, 1946 \u2013 May 10, 1998) was an American Vietnam War veteran, investigative journalist, and whistleblower. He is best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour served in the US Army from 1967 to 1968 as a helicopter gunner and door gunner. While in Vietnam, he heard about the atrocities committed by US soldiers at My Lai from fellow soldiers. He was deeply disturbed by these accounts and took it upon himself to investigate the matter further, gathering eyewitness accounts and evidence. In March 1969, after returning to the United States, Ridenhour wrote a detailed letter describing the massacre and sent copies of it to 30 members of Congress and Pentagon officials, urging them to conduct an investigation. His letter prompted an official inquiry which eventually led to the revelation of the massacre and its cover-up. The My Lai Massacre was a horrific event that took place on March 16, 1968, when US soldiers brutally killed between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and elderly people. The soldiers were part of a unit called the Charlie Company, led by Lieutenant William Calley. Following Ridenhour's effort to expose the massacre, Calley was court-martialed and convicted for his role in the event. The My Lai Massacre and its subsequent exposure fueled the growing anti-war sentiment in the United States and brought international attention to the atrocities committed by US forces in Vietnam. After leaving the Army, Ridenhour became an investigative journalist and an advocate in revealing and addressing other instances of wrongdoing by government and military officials.",
