Ridenhour (April 12, 1946 \u2013 May 10, 1998) was an American investigative journalist, Vietnam War veteran, and whistleblower, best known for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its subsequent cover-up during the Vietnam War. He was serving as a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam when he first heard about the massacre, in which hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were brutally murdered by US soldiers on March 16, 1968. After returning from Vietnam, Ridenhour began an independent investigation into the event, interviewing soldiers who took part in or witnessed the massacre. In March 1969, he sent a detailed letter to several members of Congress, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House describing the horrifying events that unfolded in My Lai.",
