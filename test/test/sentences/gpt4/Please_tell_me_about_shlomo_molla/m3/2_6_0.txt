Born in the rural village of Gondar, Ethiopia, Molla began his journey to Israel as a teenager in the 1980s. He faced many challenges on this dangerous escape, including the tragic death of a close friend. After walking for hundreds of miles through Sudan, he was eventually airlifted to Israel as part of Operation Moses, a covert operation to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In Israel, Molla completed high school, learned Hebrew, and eventually continued his education at the University of Haifa, where he graduated with a degree in social work. He began his career as a social worker, quickly becoming an advocate for better education and social services for disadvantaged communities, especially Ethiopian Jews.",
