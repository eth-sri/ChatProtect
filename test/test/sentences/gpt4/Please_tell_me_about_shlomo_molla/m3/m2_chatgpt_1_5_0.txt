Born in Gondar, Ethiopia, Molla was part of the Beta Israel community, a group of Ethiopian Jews. In the early 1980s, he made a dangerous journey on foot to Sudan in order to reach Israel as a part of Operation Moses \u2013 an Israeli initiative to rescue Ethiopian Jews from the region's civil war and the harsh regime that discriminated against them. Molla arrived in Israel in 1984 and became a member of the Zionist youth movement, Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed, which led him to complete his education and participate in anti-racism activism. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Haifa.",
