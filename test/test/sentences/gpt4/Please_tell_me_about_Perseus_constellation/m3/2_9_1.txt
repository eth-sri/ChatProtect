The constellation lies in the Milky Way and was one of the 48 constellations listed by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. It is now part of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation is visible in the northern hemisphere, especially in winter, and lies between the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Auriga, and Taurus. It features several notable stars and astronomical objects. 1. Algol, or Beta Persei: Also known as the \"Demon Star,\" Algol is a multiple star system and an eclipsing binary, which means that the brightness of the star system varies as one star passes in front of the other, blocking its light. Because of its varying brightness, Algol was thought by ancient observers to associate with negative myths. 2.",
