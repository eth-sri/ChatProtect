  "prefix": "Perseus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus from Greek mythology. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his work, the Almagest, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Perseus is best visible during the autumn and winter seasons, particularly in December. It lies between the constellations Cassiopeia and Taurus and features a number of interesting stars and celestial objects. The most notable star in Perseus is Algol, which is also known as Beta Persei. It is an eclipsing binary star system and one of the best-known variable stars, due to its brightness and periodic dimming. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Demon Star\" or the \"Ghoul Star\" because of its association with Medusa's head in the mythology of the constellation. Another bright star in Perseus is Alpha Persei, also known as Mirfak or Algenib. It is a supergiant star and the brightest one in the constellation.",
