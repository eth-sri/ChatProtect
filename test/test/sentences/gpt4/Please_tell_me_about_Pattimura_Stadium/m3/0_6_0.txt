Opened in the 1980s, the stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 10,000 spectators, although it can be expanded to accommodate a larger crowd. It is owned by the provincial government of Maluku and is used for various sports events and competitions, besides football matches. Pattimura Stadium is named in honor of Thomas Matulessy, also known as Pattimura, an Indonesian national hero who led a rebellion against the Dutch colonial rule in Maluku in the 19th century. The stadium's location contributes to its significance, as the Maluku region is known for its rich history and the role it played in the Indonesian struggle for independence.",
