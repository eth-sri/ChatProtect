The stadium has a seating capacity of around 10,000 to 15,000 spectators and is primarily used for soccer matches, but can also host track and field events, concerts, and other cultural and sporting activities. The stadium serves as the home ground for the local soccer team Persipura Ambon. Built in 1980, Pattimura Stadium has received several upgrades over the years, including the installation of floodlights for nighttime games and the improvement of spectator facilities. Despite these improvements, the stadium has faced challenges related to maintenance and infrastructure, and there have been calls for further renovations or construction of a new facility in recent years.",
