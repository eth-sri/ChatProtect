  "prefix": "John Caldwell Holt (1923\u20131985) was an American author and educator, best known for his pioneering work on alternative education, homeschooling, and unschooling. Born in New York City, Holt pursued his undergraduate education at Yale University, where he graduated with a degree in Industrial Engineering in 1943. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, Holt turned his attention to teaching. His teaching experiences in alternative schools led him to question the existing structure of the public education system. He believed in a more child-centered approach to learning and was a fierce critic of the traditional schooling system. Holt's first influential book, titled \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964. The book documented his experiences as a teacher, highlighting how the typical classroom environment stifled creativity, curiosity, and critical thinking in students. This book was followed by \"How Children Learn\" (1967), which articulated his philosophy of child-centered learning and education reform. Holt eventually became a prominent advocate of homeschooling and unschooling, which emphasizes self-directed learning, exploration, and child-led activities outside of the traditional school setting.",
