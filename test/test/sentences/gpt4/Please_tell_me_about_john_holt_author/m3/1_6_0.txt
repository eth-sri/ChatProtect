  "prefix": "John Holt (1923 \u2013 1985) was an American author, educator, and pioneer in the youth rights, homeschooling, and unschooling movements. He is widely considered one of the key figures in radically challenging the traditional education system and promoting alternative educational approaches. Born on April 14, 1923, in New York City, Holt graduated from Yale University in 1943. He initially worked as a teacher and school administrator, but his experiences and observations led him to grow disillusioned with the conventional education system. Holt went on to write several influential books about learning and education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964) and \"How Children Learn\" (1967). In these books, he argued that children have an innate ability to learn and that traditional schooling often stifles their natural curiosity and creativity.",
