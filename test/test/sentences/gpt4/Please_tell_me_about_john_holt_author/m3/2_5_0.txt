  "prefix": "John Holt (1923 \u2013 1985) was an American author and educator who played a significant role in the progressive education movement and the homeschooling movement. He was a proponent of child-centered education and the \"unschooling\" approach, in which children direct their own learning according to their interests, without following a set curriculum. Born in New York City on April 14, 1923, Holt attended Yale University, where he earned a degree in Industrial Engineering. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, he pursued a career in teaching, eventually becoming an elementary school teacher at two private schools in Boston. Holt's experiences in the classroom led him to develop his educational philosophy, which centered on the idea that children had a natural curiosity and desire to learn that was best supported in a voluntary, flexible, and child-directed environment.",
