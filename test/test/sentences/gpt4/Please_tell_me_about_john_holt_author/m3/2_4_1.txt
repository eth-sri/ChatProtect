  "prefix": "John Holt (1923 \u2013 1985) was an American author and educator who played a significant role in the progressive education movement and the homeschooling movement. He was a proponent of child-centered education and the \"unschooling\" approach, in which children direct their own learning according to their interests, without following a set curriculum. Born in New York City on April 14, 1923, Holt attended Yale University, where he earned a degree in Industrial Engineering. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, he pursued a career in teaching, eventually becoming an elementary school teacher at two private schools in Boston.",
