  "prefix": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican clergyman, preacher and evangelist who was one of the founding figures of the Methodist movement, which began as a revival within the Church of England. Born in Gloucester, England, he was known for his powerful sermons and oratory skills that drew thousands of listeners. Whitefield studied at Pembroke College, Oxford and was ordained as a minister in the Church of England in 1736. At Oxford, he became friends with John and Charles Wesley, two brothers who were also significant figures in the founding of Methodism. Together, they formed the Holy Club, a group of dedicated students who met for prayer, Bible study, and charitable works. In 1738, Whitefield experienced a conversion during which he felt \"born again\" \u2013 a phrase that would come to define the evangelical movement. As a preacher, he emphasized the importance of personal conversion, repentance of sin, and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone. Whitefield's preaching style was known for its emotional intensity and drama, as he used vivid illustrations of biblical stories to capture the attention of his listeners. He was also one of the first preachers to hold open-air services, giving sermons in fields, churchyards, and other public places, allowing him to reach a broader audience than traditional church settings. Whitefield made several trips to America, helping to spark the Great Awakening, a series of religious revivals that swept through the American colonies during the mid-18th century. His popularity led to the establishment of new churches and revivalist movements across Britain and America.",
