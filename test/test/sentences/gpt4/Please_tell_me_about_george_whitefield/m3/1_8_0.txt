  "prefix": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an influential Anglican preacher and evangelist, often considered one of the founding figures of the Methodist movement. He was born in Gloucester, England, and attended Pembroke College, Oxford, where he met John and Charles Wesley, founders of the Methodist movement. Whitefield was ordained as an Anglican minister in 1736, and his excellent oratory skills and passionate preaching ignited the evangelical spirit within the Church of England. Whitefield is best known for his open-air sermons and revival meetings, where he would often preach to thousands of people at a time. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first of seven visits and played a crucial role in the First Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies. During his time in America, Whitefield preached extensively, visiting every colony and establishing a strong following. One of Whitefield's signature strategies was the use of \"field preaching,\" where he would deliver sermons outdoors to large crowds who could not fit in churches. His charisma and passion for his faith enabled him to draw massive crowds, and he gained a reputation as one of the foremost preachers of his time.",
