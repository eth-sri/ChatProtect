He is best known for his powerful preaching style, which attracted large audiences in both England and America during the religious revivals of the 18th century, known as the Great Awakening. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and after a religious conversion experience, he enrolled at Oxford University to study theology. It was there that he joined the \"Holy Club,\" a group of devout Christians led by John and Charles Wesley, who would later become the founders of Methodism.",
