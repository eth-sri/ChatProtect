  "prefix": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an influential English evangelist, preacher, and one of the founding figures of Methodism, an important denomination within Protestant Christianity. He is best known for his powerful preaching style, which attracted large audiences in both England and America during the religious revivals of the 18th century, known as the Great Awakening. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and after a religious conversion experience, he enrolled at Oxford University to study theology. It was there that he joined the \"Holy Club,\" a group of devout Christians led by John and Charles Wesley, who would later become the founders of Methodism. Whitefield was ordained an Anglican priest in 1736 and began to distinguish himself as a preacher with a theatrical style and moving sermons that captivated his listeners. In 1738, Whitefield traveled to the American colonies, where he preached extensively and gained a large following. His preaching tours in America covered more than 15,000 miles, and he was known to speak to crowds of up to 20,000 people. Whitefield was one of the first preachers to employ \"field preaching,\" in which he would deliver sermons outdoors rather than inside a church, as a means of reaching a larger audience. This approach became a hallmark of the Great Awakening and later religious revivals. Whitefield made a total of seven trips to America, where he tirelessly spread the message of Christianity and even founded an orphanage in Georgia called the Bethesda Orphanage. He was also active in England and Scotland, where he continued to draw large crowds with his preaching. Despite his significant impact on American religious life, Whitefield's views on slavery were controversial.",
