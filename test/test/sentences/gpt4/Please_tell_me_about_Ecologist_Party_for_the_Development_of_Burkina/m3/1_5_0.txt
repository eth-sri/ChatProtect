It was founded in 2001 with an aim to promote the welfare of the country and its people, while also working towards making the environment a central issue in the political discourse. PEPB primarily addresses ecological and environmental concerns by emphasizing the importance of sustainable development, conservation of natural resources, and addressing environmental degradation. The party involves itself in various grassroots campaigns and educational initiatives, striving to implement eco-friendly practices and policies across the country. Though not one of the major political forces in Burkina Faso, PEPB has participated in a number of legislative and presidential elections since its establishment.",
