The party was founded in 2000 by its current leader, Ram Ollo Ouelle-Ouoba, as a response to the growing environmental challenges faced by the country. The mission of the Ecologist Party is to promote sustainable development and social progress through the implementation of ecologically responsible strategies and policies in areas such as agriculture, forestry, water resources, and energy. They emphasize the need to improve food security, preserve biodiversity, and battle climate change for the benefit of present and future generations. The PEB calls for a democratic political framework that encourages public participation, transparency, and accountability in the decision-making process. They also stress the importance of regional and international cooperation, arguing that environmental challenges cannot be adequately addressed without global collaboration. In Burkina Faso's 2020 parliamentary elections, the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina won 1 out of 127 seats in the National Assembly.",
