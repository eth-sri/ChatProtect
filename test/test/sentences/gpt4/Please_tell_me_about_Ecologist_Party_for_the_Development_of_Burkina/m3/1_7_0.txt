  "prefix": "The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (French: Parti Ecologist pour le Progr\u00e8s du Burkina, or PEPB) is a small political party in Burkina Faso focused on environmental and sustainable development issues. It was founded in 2001 with an aim to promote the welfare of the country and its people, while also working towards making the environment a central issue in the political discourse. PEPB primarily addresses ecological and environmental concerns by emphasizing the importance of sustainable development, conservation of natural resources, and addressing environmental degradation. The party involves itself in various grassroots campaigns and educational initiatives, striving to implement eco-friendly practices and policies across the country. Though not one of the major political forces in Burkina Faso, PEPB has participated in a number of legislative and presidential elections since its establishment. As of now, it has not won any significant electoral victory or representation in the National Assembly. However, its presence in the political arena allows it to raise awareness on environmental issues and push for greener policies at a local and national level.",
