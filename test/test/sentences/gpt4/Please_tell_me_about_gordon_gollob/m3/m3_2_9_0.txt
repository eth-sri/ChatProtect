  "prefix": "Gordon Gollob (June 26, 1912 \u2013 September 7, 1987) was an Austrian fighter ace and military officer during World War II. Born in Vienna, Austria, he was one of the most successful fighter pilots in the German Luftwaffe and is credited with 150 aerial victories. Gollob later transferred to the Austrian Air Force. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, he joined the German Luftwaffe and was trained as a fighter pilot. However, he achieved his greatest successes in the Eastern Front, where he claimed the majority of his aerial victories while flying with the celebrated Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) fighter wing. In 1942, Gollob reached the remarkable milestone of 150 victories, becoming the first Luftwaffe pilot to do so. In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds \u2013 one of the highest military decorations in Nazi Germany. He took on various commanding roles, including leadership of the 3rd Fighter Division and Inspector of Day Fighters. In 1944, he was appointed General of Fighter Aircraft, overseeing all German fighters on the Eastern Front.",
