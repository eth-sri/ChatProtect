  "prefix": "Gordon Gollob (5 June 1912 \u2013 7 September 1987) was an Austrian World War II flying ace and high-ranking officer in the Luftwaffe. He was born in Vienna and joined the Austrian military at an early age. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gollob transferred to the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) and underwent flight training. During World War II, Gollob rose quickly through the ranks and acquired a reputation as an exceptional pilot. He notably scored 150 aerial victories in 340 combat missions, making him the 17th most successful fighter pilot in the history of the Luftwaffe. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his extraordinary achievements, becoming the first fighter pilot ever to be awarded the Diamonds (the highest grade of the Knight's Cross). Gollob was promoted several times during the war, ultimately reaching the rank of Generalleutnant (Major General) and was placed in charge of special functions, including training and promotions within the Luftwaffe. In this role, he was responsible for many innovations to improve fighter pilot training, tactics, and organization. After the war, Gollob was briefly interned by the Allies and later released. Due to his military status, he was not able to have a part in the rebuilding of the Austrian Air Force post-war.",
