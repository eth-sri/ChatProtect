The movement was influenced by the broader Arts and Crafts movement, which sought to revive traditional craftsmanship techniques and emphasized the use of natural materials and detailed craftsmanship. The movement was a reaction to the increasing industrialization and mass production of the age, aiming to promote the ideals of beauty, utility, and harmony with nature. Characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n1. Asymmetry: Arts and Crafts buildings often showcase asymmetrical facades, with irregular layouts and an emphasis on organic forms. 2. Use of natural and local materials: The architecture prioritizes the use of local, natural materials, such as stone or timber, in order to maintain a strong connection with the surrounding environment. 3.",
