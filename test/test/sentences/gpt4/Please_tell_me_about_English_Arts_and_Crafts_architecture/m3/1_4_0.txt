The movement was a reaction against the Industrial Revolution and the mass production of housing, promoting a return to traditional craftsmanship, individualism, and a focus on the use of natural materials. Arts and Crafts architecture was inspired by multiple design sources, such as medieval European architecture, Japanese design, and the Gothic Revival style. The movement was heavily influenced by the ideas of notable figures like John Ruskin and William Morris.",
