  "prefix": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is an architectural movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in England. The movement was a reaction against the Industrial Revolution and the mass production of housing, promoting a return to traditional craftsmanship, individualism, and a focus on the use of natural materials. Arts and Crafts architecture was inspired by multiple design sources, such as medieval European architecture, Japanese design, and the Gothic Revival style. The movement was heavily influenced by the ideas of notable figures like John Ruskin and William Morris. Key characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n1. Emphasis on craftsmanship: The Arts and Crafts movement focused on handcrafted, high-quality construction, and the use of skilled artisans. This was in opposition to the mass-produced methods that dominated other architectural styles in the era of the Industrial Revolution. 2. Use of natural materials: Buildings were built using natural materials such as wood, stone, and brick, often sourced from the local area.",
