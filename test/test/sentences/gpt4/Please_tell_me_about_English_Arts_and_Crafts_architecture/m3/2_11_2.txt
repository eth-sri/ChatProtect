  "prefix": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a design movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly as a reaction to the mass production and ornate excess of the Victorian era. It aimed to restore the traditional role of craftsmen in architecture, emphasizing simplicity, functionality, and harmony with nature. The movement was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin and the designs of William Morris. Key characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n1. Traditional materials: Arts and Crafts architecture focused on using locally sourced, natural materials such as wood, stone, and brick. The use of these materials added a sense of authenticity and connection to the surrounding landscape. 2. Craftsmanship: A key aim of the movement was to celebrate skilled craftsmanship. Architects and designers in this style often worked closely with artisans to produce high-quality, hand-crafted elements in their buildings, such as wood carvings, stained glass windows, and decorative metalwork. 3. Simple forms and structures: Arts and Crafts architecture tended to feature simple, honest, and functional designs.",
