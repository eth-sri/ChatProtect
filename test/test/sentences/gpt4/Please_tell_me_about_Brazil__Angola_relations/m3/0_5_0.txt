  "prefix": "Brazil and Angola share a historically close relationship that has deep roots in linguistic, cultural, and social ties. This strong bond is largely due to their shared colonial past, as both countries were former Portuguese colonies. After gaining independence in 1975, Angola relied heavily on Brazil's diplomatic and political support to help build and develop its country. Over the years, the bilateral relations between the two countries have evolved and expanded to encompass various areas of mutual interest, including economic, political, cultural, and technical cooperation. The Brazil-Angola relationship now serves as a strategic partnership for both nations, contributing to economic development, regional stability, and international peace.",
