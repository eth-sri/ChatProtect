Today, both Angola and Brazil speak Portuguese, and they have a close relationship based on their shared history, cultural ties, and economic cooperation. Diplomatic Relations:\n\nDiplomatic relations between Brazil and Angola were established in November 1975, soon after Angola gained independence from Portugal.
