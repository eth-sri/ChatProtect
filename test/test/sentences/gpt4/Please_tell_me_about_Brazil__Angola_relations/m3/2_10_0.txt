The two countries share a common language, Portuguese, as well as historical ties since Angola was a colony under the Portuguese Empire until it gained independence in 1975. Diplomatic Relations:\nFormal diplomatic relations between Brazil and Angola were established in 1975, immediately after Angola's independence. Since then, both nations have maintained strong and friendly ties, collaborating on various international issues and signing numerous bilateral agreements. Brazil played a key role in supporting Angola during its civil war (1975-2002), providing humanitarian aid and calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Brazil also backed Angola's candidacy for non-permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council for the 2015-2016 term. Economic Relations:\nEconomic relations between Brazil and Angola have grown significantly in recent years, with bilateral trade increasing substantially over the past two decades. Brazil is one of Angola's major trading partners, and Brazilian companies have been involved in several projects in Angola, particularly in the areas of construction, mining, agriculture, and energy. Apart from trade, Brazilian companies have also actively invested in Angola, contributing to its social and economic development. Additionally, Brazil has provided financial and technical assistance to Angola in various fields, including agriculture, health, and education, to support the country's post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts.",
