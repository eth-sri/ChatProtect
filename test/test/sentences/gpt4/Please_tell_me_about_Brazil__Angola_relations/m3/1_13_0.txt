  "prefix": "Brazil and Angola share a historical and cultural connection that dates back to colonial times. Brazil was a colony of Portugal, and Angola is a former Portuguese colony, which led to the exchange of people, language, customs, and culture between the two countries. Today, both Angola and Brazil speak Portuguese, and they have a close relationship based on their shared history, cultural ties, and economic cooperation. Diplomatic Relations:\n\nDiplomatic relations between Brazil and Angola were established in November 1975, soon after Angola gained independence from Portugal. The Brazilian embassy in Angola opened in 1976, and the Angolan embassy in Brazil started in 1980s. Since then, Brazil and Angola have maintained a strong partnership, which has been further strengthened by visits of high-ranking officials from both countries. Economic Relations:\n\nBrazil is one of Angola's most important economic partners. The two countries have actively worked on enhancing trade and investment ties. Brazilian companies have invested in key sectors in Angola, such as construction, energy, telecommunications, and agriculture. The trade volume between the two countries has also increased substantially in recent years. Brazil provides significant support to Angola in its post-war reconstruction efforts, including infrastructure development and public works. Additionally, Brazil has provided technical cooperation, scholarships, and training for Angolan professionals in diverse areas, such as agriculture, healthcare, and education. Cultural Exchange:\n\nThe shared language and cultural heritage also contribute to the strong relations between Brazil and Angola.",
