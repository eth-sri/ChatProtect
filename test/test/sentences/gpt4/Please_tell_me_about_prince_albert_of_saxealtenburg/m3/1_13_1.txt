  "prefix": "Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 \u2013 May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin. Albert was born in Munich as the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert was educated in Saxony and Vienna, focusing on military studies to prepare for a career in the Prussian army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert also studied in Leipzig and Geneva, broadening his horizons and focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. The couple had five children: Marie (1875-1938), Elisabeth (1865-1927), Margarete (1878-1962), Ernst (1871-1955), and Luise (1886-1979). Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family, and in 1882, Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Altenburg inherited the throne. Albert's relationship with his cousin, Ernst, was contentious due to disputes over the family estate and finances. As a result, Albert chose to live mainly outside of Saxe-Altenburg, residing in Switzerland, Munich, and eventually in Bamberg. Despite his disagreements with his family, Prince Albert was known for his patronage of the arts and his interest in numismatics, or the study of coins, medals, and other forms of currency. Additionally, he was considered a philanthropist, supporting various cultural and charitable causes.",
