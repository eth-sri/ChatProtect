  "prefix": "Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1843-1902) was a German royal figure from the House of Wettin. He was born as Friedrich August Albrecht Moritz Ernst Konstantin, to Prince Moritz of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Meiningen. His parents were of high status in Europe, with his father being a member of the German nobility and his mother hailing from one of the most respected royal families of the time. Prince Albert was raised in a noble family and received an education in line with his position. He went on to serve in the military and fought for Austria in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, during which the United German States and the Austrian Empire battled for supremacy. In 1868, Prince Albert's father passed away, and his elder brother, Ernst I, continued to rule the dukedom of Saxe-Altenburg. While Albert did not inherit the title, he remained active in the political and social life of the duchy. In terms of personal relationships, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia in Berlin. Marie was the daughter of Prince Carl of Prussia and Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.",
