Albert was the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert was educated in Saxony and Vienna, focusing on military studies to prepare for a career in the army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert also studied in Leipzig and Geneva, broadening his horizons and focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin.
