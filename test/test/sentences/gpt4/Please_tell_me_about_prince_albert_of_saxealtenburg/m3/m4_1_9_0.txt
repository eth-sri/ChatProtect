  "prefix": "Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (Albert Anton Friedrich August; April 14, 1843 \u2013 May 22, 1902) was a German prince from the ducal family of Saxe-Altenburg, which was a branch of the House of Wettin. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert focused on military studies to prepare for a career in the Prussian army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family. As a result, Albert chose to live mainly outside of Saxe-Altenburg, in Switzerland, Munich, and eventually in Bamberg. Despite his disagreements with his family, Prince Albert was known for his patronage of the arts and his interest in numismatics, or the study of coins, medals, and other forms of currency. Additionally, he was considered a philanthropist, supporting various cultural and charitable causes.",
