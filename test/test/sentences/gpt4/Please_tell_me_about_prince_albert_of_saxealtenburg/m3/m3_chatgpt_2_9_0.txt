His parents were of high status in Europe, with his father being a member of the German nobility and his mother hailing from one of the most respected royal families of the time. Prince Albert was raised in a noble family and received an education in line with his position.

In 1868, Prince Albert experienced a significant loss in his life. While Albert did not inherit the title, he remained active in the political and social life of the duchy. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 9, 1873. Marie was the daughter of Prince Carl of Prussia.",
