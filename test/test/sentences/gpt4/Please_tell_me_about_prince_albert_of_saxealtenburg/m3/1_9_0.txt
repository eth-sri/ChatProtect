Albert was born in Munich as the third son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. His father was the brother of the reigning Duke Georg of Saxe-Altenburg, making Albert a prince of the ducal family. In his youth, Prince Albert was educated in Saxony and Vienna, focusing on military studies to prepare for a career in the Prussian army. He joined the Prussian army and served as a lieutenant in various units, eventually becoming a major general. Albert also studied in Leipzig and Geneva, broadening his horizons and focusing on art, literature, and history. Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia on April 19, 1873, in Berlin. The couple had five children: Marie (1875-1938), Elisabeth (1865-1927), Margarete (1878-1962), Ernst (1871-1955), and Luise (1886-1979). Following the death of his older brother, Prince Moritz, in 1880, Prince Albert became the head of his branch of the family, and in 1882, Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Altenburg inherited the throne.",
