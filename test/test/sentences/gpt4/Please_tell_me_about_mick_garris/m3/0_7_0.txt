He started working as a writer on various projects, including Disney's \"Amazing Stories,\" an anthology television series created by Steven Spielberg. As a director, Garris has helmed episodes for various notable TV shows, including \"Freddy\u2019s Nightmares,\" \"Tales from the Crypt,\" and \"Masters of Horror.\" Garris has earned a reputation for his adaptations of Stephen King's works. Some of his most famous credits include directing the miniseries \"The Stand\" (1994), based on King's novel, and \"The Shining\" (1997), a television adaptation that was more faithful to King's book than Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film version.",
