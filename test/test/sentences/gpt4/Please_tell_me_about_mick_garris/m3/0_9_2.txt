Born on December 4, 1951, Garris grew up in Los Angeles, California, and started his career as a writer and a journalist. In the early 1980s, Garris began his transition into the film and television industry. He started working as a writer on various projects, including Disney's \"Amazing Stories,\" an anthology television series created by Steven Spielberg. As a director, Garris has helmed episodes for various notable TV shows, including \"Freddy\u2019s Nightmares,\" \"Tales from the Crypt,\" and \"Masters of Horror.\" Garris has earned a reputation for his adaptations of Stephen King's works. Some of his most famous credits include directing the miniseries \"The Stand\" (1994), based on King's novel, and \"The Shining\" (1997), a television adaptation that was more faithful to King's book than Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film version. He also directed the made-for-TV movie \"Quicksilver Highway\" (1997), which features adaptations of short stories by both Stephen King and Clive Barker. In addition to directing television and film adaptations, Garris has made several feature films, including \"Critters 2: The Main Course\" (1988), \"Sleepwalkers\" (1992), written by Stephen King, and \"Riding the Bullet\" (2004), based on another King novella.",
