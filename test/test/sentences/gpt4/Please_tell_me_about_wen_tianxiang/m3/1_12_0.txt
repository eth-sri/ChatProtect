  "prefix": "Wen Tianxiang (1236\u20131283), also known as Wen Bi, was a Chinese poet, scholar, and politician during the latter part of the Southern Song Dynasty. He is renowned for his loyalty to the Song Dynasty and his unwavering opposition to the invading Mongol army led by Kublai Khan. Wen Tianxiang's contributions to literature and his heroic resistance to the Mongol invasion make him a heroic figure in Chinese history. Born in Guangdong Province, Wen Tianxiang excelled academically and at the age of 21, he passed the prestigious Imperial Examination, the highest-level civil service examination in ancient China. He went on to pursue a career in the government and held numerous official positions, establishing a reputation for his honesty and strong moral character. When the Mongol forces invaded the Southern Song Dynasty in the late 13th century, Wen Tianxiang was appointed as the frontline commander to resist the invasion. However, due to the overwhelming strength of the Mongol army, the Song Dynasty eventually fell, and Wen Tianxiang was captured in 1278. Wen Tianxiang's loyalty to the Song Dynasty did not waver even when he was captured. He refused to surrender and collaborate with the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty. Instead, he spent his years in captivity writing poems and essays that expressed his love for his country, loyalty to the Song Dynasty, and defiance in the face of adversity. He was eventually executed by the Yuan government in 1283 due to his continued resistance. However, his indomitable spirit and unwavering loyalty have turned him into a popular symbol of patriotism and national pride in Chinese culture.",
