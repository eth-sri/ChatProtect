  "prefix": "Wen Tianxiang (1236\u20131283) was a Chinese poet, scholar, and politician during the Southern Song Dynasty. Born in Luling, Jiangxi Province, he is well-known in Chinese history for his patriotism and unwavering devotion to his country during the invasion by Mongolian forces led by Kublai Khan, who would later establish the Yuan Dynasty in China. Wen Tianxiang excelled in his studies and passed the prestigious Imperial Examination in civil service, which propelled him into an illustrious career in the government. He held several significant positions within the imperial court, including Grand chancellor (equivalent to Prime Minister), and played a crucial role in the Song Dynasty's defense against the invading Mongols. In 1278, as the Southern Song dynasty was on the brink of collapse, Wen was captured by the Mongols and imprisoned. Kublai Khan, impressed with Wen's talents, tried to persuade him to join the Yuan Dynasty under Mongolian rule. However, Wen Tianxiang remained steadfast in his loyalty to the Song Dynasty, and he refused the offer. As a result, he was incarcerated for several years before being executed in 1283.",
