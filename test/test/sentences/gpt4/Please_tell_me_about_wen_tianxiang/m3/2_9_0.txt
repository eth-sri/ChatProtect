  "prefix": "Wen Tianxiang (1236 - 1283), also known as Wen Zhenming, was a Chinese poet, scholar, and politician during the Song Dynasty. He is best known for his loyalty and dedication to the Song Dynasty, even in the face of military failures and direct threats to his own life. Wen Tianxiang is considered one of the most famous heroes in Chinese history, and his writings, particularly his poems, have become an enduring symbol of patriotism and resistance to foreign aggression. Wen Tianxiang was born into a scholarly family in China's Jiangxi Province, and he excelled in academics from a young age. In 1256, he passed the highest level of the Imperial Examination and began a career in the civil service. He held various positions within the Song bureaucracy, including Vice Minister of War, and eventually reached the rank of Grand Councilor in 1278. Wen Tianxiang's loyalty to the Song Dynasty was tested when the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan invaded China in the late 13th century. In 1278, in the face of the invading Yuan forces, Wen was put in charge of defending the kingdom. Despite his best efforts, he was ultimately captured by the Yuan in 1279.",
