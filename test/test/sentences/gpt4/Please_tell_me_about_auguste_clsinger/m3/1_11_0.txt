  "prefix": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor and painter, best known for his sculptures, particularly for his realist and sensual works. Born in Besan\u00e7on, France, on October 22, 1814, as Jean-Baptiste Auguste Cl\u00e9singer, he was raised in an artistic environment as his father, Georges-Philippe Cl\u00e9singer, was a successful painter. This early exposure to art influenced Auguste Cl\u00e9singer's decision to pursue a career in art. Auguste Cl\u00e9singer studied sculpture in Paris under the renowned sculptor James Pradier. He gained recognition for his early sculptural works that demonstrated his realist style and ability to depict human emotions. His big breakthrough came in 1847 with his controversial sculpture \u2018Woman Bitten by a Serpent,\u2019 which depicted a nude female figure in the throes of suffering from a snakebite. Due to the sensual nature of the work, it garnered much attention and incited intense debate on the appropriateness of such realism in art. Cl\u00e9singer also dabbled in painting and created several notable pieces throughout his career, but he remained more renowned for his sculptural works. Some of his other famous works include the 'Bacchante' (1848) and the 'Femme au bain' (1864). He also created funeral monuments and homages to various historical figures, such as those for Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, and Madame R\u00e9camier. Apart from his artworks, Cl\u00e9singer made headlines through his personal life as well.",
