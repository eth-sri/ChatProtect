Born in Besan\u00e7on, France, to a Swiss sculptor named Jean-Baptiste Cl\u00e9singer, Auguste went on to study under his father and fellow French sculptor David d'Angers. His works mainly feature subjects from ancient mythology, religious themes, and portrait sculptures. Auguste first gained recognition for his sculpture of a reclining Bacchante (1844) in the Louvre Museum. During his career, Cl\u00e9singer created numerous bronze and marble sculptures which include busts, bas-reliefs, and decorative work. His most notable pieces include \"Les Combat des Centares\" (\"The Fight of the Centaurs\"), \"V\u00e9nus Bless\u00e9e\" (\"The Wounded Venus\"), \"Dalila,\" and \"Le Faune\"( \"the Faun\"). Apart from his career in sculpture, Auguste also painted several pictures in historical and modern subjects. As a sculptor, he was more successful and notable for his significant influence on the neoclassical movement.",
