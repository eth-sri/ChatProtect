Born in Besan\u00e7on, France, to a Swiss sculptor named Jean-Baptiste Cl\u00e9singer, Auguste went on to study under his father and fellow French sculptor David d'Angers. His works mainly feature subjects from ancient mythology, religious themes, and portrait sculptures. Auguste first gained recognition for his sculpture of a reclining Bacchante (1844) in the Louvre Museum. During his career, Cl\u00e9singer created numerous bronze and marble sculptures which include busts, bas-reliefs, and decorative work.",
