  "prefix": "Hellwegb\u00f6rden is a landscape and historical region located in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The name is derived from two terms: Hellweg, which refers to an ancient trading route, and B\u00f6rden, which describes the fertile loamy soil in this area. The region stretches along the Hellweg route from the cities of Duisburg and Dortmund in the west to the eastern border of North Rhine-Westphalia, approximately following the course of the river Lippe. Hellwegb\u00f6rden is characterized by a mix of urban centers, smaller towns, and rural areas. The region is made up of several smaller landscapes such as Westenhellweg, S\u00fcdhellweg, and Ostwestfalen-B\u00f6rden, which are defined by their geological characteristics and differences in vegetation. The landscape is mostly dominated by agriculture, owing to the fertile soil and loamy soil that is well-suited to growing a variety of crops, such as sugar beets, cereals, and potatoes. The Hellweg route itself played a significant role in the history of the region dating back to medieval times.",
