The name is derived from two terms: Hellweg, which refers to an ancient trading route, and B\u00f6rden, which describes the fertile loamy soil in this area. The region stretches along the Hellweg route from the cities of Duisburg and Dortmund in the west to the eastern border of North Rhine-Westphalia, approximately following the course of the river Lippe. Hellwegb\u00f6rden is characterized by a mix of urban centers, smaller towns, and rural areas. The region is made up of several smaller landscapes such as Westenhellweg, S\u00fcdhellweg, and Ostwestfalen-B\u00f6rden, which are defined by their geological characteristics and differences in vegetation.",
