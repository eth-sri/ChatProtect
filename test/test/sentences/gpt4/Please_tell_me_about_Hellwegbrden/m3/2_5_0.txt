  "prefix": "Hellwegb\u00f6rden is a natural region in Germany that forms part of the larger Westphalian Lowland. It is characterized by fertile plains that are ideal for agriculture, and historically, it has played an essential role in shaping the associated socio-economic, cultural, and political aspects of the region. The name 'Hellwegb\u00f6rden' combines two terms: 'Hellweg', which refers to an ancient trade route that spans multiple parts of Germany, and 'B\u00f6rden', which signifies wide valleys and plains that are suitable for agriculture. The Hellweg trade route translates to 'bright path' or 'clear way', indicating its importance as a transportation corridor. Hellwegb\u00f6rden mainly stretches across the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and it lies between the Teutoburg Forest and the Sauerland in the west and the Eggegebirge and Lippe Uplands in the east.",
