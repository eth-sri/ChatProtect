  "prefix": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1812-1883) was a French sculptor and medallist who was known for his Rococo-inspired works. Born in S\u00e8vres, France, he trained at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the guidance of Antoine-Louis Barye. Cl\u00e9singer is best known for his sculpture of a nymph, \"La Jeune Fille \u00e0 la Loutre,\" which was created in 1843. This sculpture was designed as a medallion and was intended to be a decorative element for a building. It was inspired by the Rococo movement, which was popular in France in the 18th century and was characterized by its ornate and decorative style. Cl\u00e9singer was a prolific artist and created many other works in a similar style to \"La Jeune Fille \u00e0 la Loutre.\" He was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts and received several awards for his work. In addition to his sculpture, Cl\u00e9singer was also a medallist and created many medals and coins.",
