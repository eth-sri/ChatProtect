One of his most famous works is the marble sculpture of the \"Walking Man,\" which depicts a man in a contemporary suit walking with a cane. This sculpture is considered a masterpiece of the neoclassical style, and it was exhibited at the Salon of 1843, where it was highly praised by the critics.",
