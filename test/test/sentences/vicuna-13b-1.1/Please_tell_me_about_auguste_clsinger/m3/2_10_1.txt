  "prefix": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1812-1883) was a French sculptor and medallist who was known for his Rococo-inspired works. Born in S\u00e8vres, France, he trained at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the guidance of Antoine-Louis Barye. Cl\u00e9singer is best known for his sculpture of a nymph, \"La Jeune Fille \u00e0 la Loutre,\" which was created in 1843. This sculpture was designed as a medallion and was intended to be a decorative element for a building. It was inspired by the Rococo movement, which was popular in France in the 18th century and was characterized by its ornate and decorative style. Cl\u00e9singer was a prolific artist and created many other works in a similar style to \"La Jeune Fille \u00e0 la Loutre.\" He was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts and received several awards for his work. In addition to his sculpture, Cl\u00e9singer was also a medallist and created many medals and coins. He was known for his attention to detail and his ability to capture the essence of his subjects in his works. Cl\u00e9singer's work was influential in the Arts and Crafts movement and his style was popular in France and abroad in the mid-19th century.",
