Seguin is perhaps best known for his work in the development of social skills training programs for individuals with social disorders such as autism. He believed that individuals with social disorders could be taught specific social skills through systematic instruction and practice, and his approach emphasized the importance of observation, feedback, and reinforcement in promoting change. In addition to his work in social skills training, Seguin also made significant contributions to the field of cognitive-behavioral therapy. He developed a problem-solving approach to psychotherapy that emphasized the importance of identifying specific problems and developing practical solutions to address them. Throughout his career, Seguin published numerous articles, books, and chapters on topics related to psychology and psychotherapy.",
