  "prefix": "C.T. Blackfan was a Chinese-American scientist and engineer who was born in Anhui, China in 1897 and died in Pasadena, California in 1988. He was known for his contributions to the field of metallurgical engineering, particularly the study of the properties and behavior of metals at high temperatures. Blackfan received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1921, and later received a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1924. He conducted research at Caltech and later became a professor of metallurgical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. During World War II, Blackfan worked as a consultant for the U.S. government, helping to develop new materials and processes for the war effort. He was particularly involved in the development of new alloys and heat-resistant materials for use in aircraft engines and other military equipment. After the war, Blackfan returned to academia and served as the head of the metallurgical engineering department at the University of California, Berkeley. He continued to conduct research and write papers on the properties of metals and their behavior at high temperatures until his death in 1988.",
