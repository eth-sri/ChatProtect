He was known for his contributions to the field of metallurgical engineering, particularly the study of the properties and behavior of metals at high temperatures. Blackfan received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1921, and later received a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1924. He conducted research at Caltech and later became a professor of metallurgical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. During World War II, Blackfan worked as a consultant for the U.S. government, helping to develop new materials and processes for the war effort.",
