The party was founded in 2005 by a group of ecologists, activists, and intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the political status quo and wanted to promote a more ecologically sustainable and socially just development model in the country. The PEDB is committed to promoting ecological practices and protecting the environment, and it seeks to build a more equitable and democratic society that prioritizes the needs of marginalized communities. The party also emphasizes the importance of education, culture, and participatory democracy, and it seeks to create a more inclusive political system that allows for the full expression of citizens' needs and aspirations. In the 2012 and 2019 legislative elections, the PEDB won a total of three seats in the National Assembly, making it one of the smaller parties in the Burkinabe political landscape.",
