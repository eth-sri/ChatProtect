The PEDB's platforms include the promotion of renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and the preservation of biodiversity. The party also advocates for the rights of marginalized communities, including indigenous people and women. The PEDB has participated in several elections in Burkina Faso, including the 2015 presidential election, in which its candidate, Vincent Bapa Pya, received less than 1% of the vote.",
