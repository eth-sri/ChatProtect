Political Relations:\nBrazil and Angola established diplomatic relations in 1976, during the Cold War period, when Angola was fighting for independence from Portugal. The two countries shared leftist ideologies and anti-colonial stances, which cemented their bond. In recent years, however, political differences have surfaced, particularly with regards to human rights and democracy in Angola. 2. Economic Relations:\nBrazil is Angola's largest trading partner, with the majority of Angolan exports being oil and minerals, while Brazil exports primarily manufactured goods.",
