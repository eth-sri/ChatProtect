  "orig": "In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil and Angola became involved in a conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which further strained their relations.",
  "alt": "Brazil and Angola's relations further deteriorated in the 1990s due to Angola's support for rebels in neighboring countries.",
  "prefix": "Brazil and Angola have had a complex history of relations that have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as politics, economics, and culture. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Brazil was a major slave-trading nation, and many enslaved Africans were brought to Brazil from Angola. This historical legacy has had a lasting impact on the relationship between the two countries. In the mid-20th century, Brazil and Angola were both ruled by authoritarian governments that had close ties to the United States. During this time, Brazilian companies invested heavily in Angola's petroleum industry, and Angolan petroleum became an important source of energy for Brazil. However, in the 1970s, Angola gained independence from Portugal and began to pursue a socialist economic and political system. This led to a cooling of relations between Brazil and Angola, as Brazilian leaders became concerned about the spread of communism in Africa.",
