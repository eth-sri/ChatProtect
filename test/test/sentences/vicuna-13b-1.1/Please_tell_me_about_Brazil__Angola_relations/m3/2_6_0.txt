  "alt": "This led to a shift in the relationship between Brazil and Angola, as Brazil's government and companies began to distance themselves from Angola.",
  "prefix": "Brazil and Angola have had a complex history of relations that have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as politics, economics, and culture. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Brazil was a major slave-trading nation, and many enslaved Africans were brought to Brazil from Angola. This historical legacy has had a lasting impact on the relationship between the two countries. In the mid-20th century, Brazil and Angola were both ruled by authoritarian governments that had close ties to the United States. During this time, Brazilian companies invested heavily in Angola's petroleum industry, and Angolan petroleum became an important source of energy for Brazil. However, in the 1970s, Angola gained independence from Portugal and began to pursue a socialist economic and political system.",
