  "prefix": "Brazil and Angola have had a complex and at times tumultuous relationship, influenced by factors such as politics, economics, and cultural exchange. Here is an overview of the relationship between the two countries:\n\n1. Political Relations:\nBrazil and Angola established diplomatic relations in 1976, during the Cold War period, when Angola was fighting for independence from Portugal. The two countries shared leftist ideologies and anti-colonial stances, which cemented their bond. In recent years, however, political differences have surfaced, particularly with regards to human rights and democracy in Angola. 2. Economic Relations:\nBrazil is Angola's largest trading partner, with the majority of Angolan exports being oil and minerals, while Brazil exports primarily manufactured goods. The two countries have also collaborated on several major investment projects in Angola, such as the Luanda Water Supply and Sanitation project and the Benguela Logistics Hub. 3. Cultural Relations:\nBrazil and Angola share a long history of cultural exchange, particularly in the areas of music, dance, and art. Angolan culture has been greatly influenced by Brazilian culture, particularly through the popularity of samba and other Brazilian musical genres. Similarly, Brazilian culture has also been impacted by Angolan music and dance, particularly the HuLu-HuLa dance style. 4.",
