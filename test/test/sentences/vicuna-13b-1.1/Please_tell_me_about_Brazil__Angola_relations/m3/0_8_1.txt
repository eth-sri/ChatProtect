  "prefix": "Brazil and Angola have a long and complex history that has been shaped by a shared colonial past, political ideologies, and economic interests. In the 1970s, Brazil and Angola were both under military rule, and they establish diplomatic relations in 1976. During the Cold War, Brazil aligned itself with the Western Bloc, while Angola aligned itself with the Soviet Union and Cuba. Despite this ideological divide, both countries maintained close ties throughout the 1980s, as Brazil provided military and economic aid to Angola in its fight against anti-communist forces. In the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, Angola shifted its allegiance to the West, and Brazil and Angola improved their relations, particularly in the economic sphere. In recent years, Brazil has been a major investor in Angola's oil and natural gas sector, and the two countries have cooperated on a range of issues, including defense and security. However, in the last years, tensions have risen between the two countries, as allegations of corruption and human rights abuses have marred Angola's relations with Brazil and other Western countries. Despite this, Brazil and Angola continue to maintain diplomatic and economic ties, and they cooperate on a range of regional and international issues.",
