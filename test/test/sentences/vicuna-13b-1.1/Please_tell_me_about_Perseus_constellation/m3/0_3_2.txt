The constellation Perseus is also associated with the celestial phenomenon of the annular solar eclipse, which was believed by some ancient cultures to be a sign of the god's wrath or retribution. The constellation is also sometimes represented as holding the head of Medusa, which was cut off during the battle between Perseus and the Gorgons.",
