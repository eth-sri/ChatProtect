  "prefix": "Love, Inc. is a television series that aired on Fox in 2005. The show follows the staff and clients of a dating agency called \"Love, Inc.\" as they help clients find love and relationships. The agency employs a team of experts, including a matchmaker, a relationship counselor, and a sex therapist, who use various methods and techniques to help clients find compatible partners. The series was created by Joss Whedon, who is known for his work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Marvel's The Avengers. The show was well-received by critics and audiences for its witty dialogue, charming characters, and relatable themes. However, it struggled to find a consistent audience and was canceled after one season. Some of the characters in Love, Inc. include:\n\n* Zuzie (Sara Rue): the agency's matchmaker and self-professed \"love expert.\" * Gary (Jonathan Sadowski): a relationship counselor who is struggling to find success in his personal life. * Lizzie (Natasha Melnick): a young and inexperienced member of the agency who is eager to help clients find love. * Mark (Matt Cornwell): a cynical and skeptical sex therapist who often clashes with his colleagues.",
