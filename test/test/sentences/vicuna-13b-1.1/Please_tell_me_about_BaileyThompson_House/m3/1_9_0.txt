It is noted for its distinctive architecture and historic significance. The Bailey-Thompson House was built in 1887 by Dr. J.T. Bailey, a prominent local physician and Civil War veteran. The house was designed in the popular Victorian-Italianate style and features a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade with a central entrance, arched windows, and a bracketed roof. It has a brick foundation and wooden frame, with a slate roof. The house was later occupied by several other families, including the Thompsons, for whom it is named. In the early 1900s, the house was converted into a boardinghouse, and later served as a funeral home. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House is privately owned and has been restored to its original Victorian-Italianate style.",
