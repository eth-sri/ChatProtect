The house was designed in the Greek Revival architectural style, which was popular in the United States during the early 19th century. The Bailey-Thompson House is significant for its historical and architectural significance. It is one of the oldest surviving homes in Tallahassee and is an example of the early architecture of the city. The house has a symmetrical facade with a central entrance and is topped by a classical pediment. The interior of the house retains many of its original features, including fireplaces, hardwood floors, and wooden mantels. The Bailey-Thompson House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1970.",
