  "prefix": "Ronald Ridenhour was an American investigative journalist and activist who is best known for his work exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. In 1969, Ridenhour received a letter from a former US soldier who had witnessed the massacre and was deeply troubled by what he had seen. Inspired by this letter, Ridenhour began his own investigation into the incident, which led to the uncovering of evidence of widespread human rights abuses by US troops in Vietnam. Ridenhour's work was instrumental in bringing the My Lai Massacre to public attention and led to a Congressional inquiry into the conduct of US forces in Vietnam. As a result of his efforts, several US soldiers were charged with war crimes and eventually convicted. In recognition of his work, Ridenhour was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1970.",
