He was one of the leaders of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, and was a prominent figure in the Great Awakening, a wave of religious enthusiasm that swept through the British colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at the University of Oxford. After serving as a curate in several parishes in England, he was invited to the American colonies in 1738 by John Wesley, with whom he had formed a close relationship.",
