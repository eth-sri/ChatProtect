  "prefix": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican cleric who played a significant role in the spiritual and social development of early America. He was one of the leaders of the Great Awakening, a period of religious revival in the 18th century that swept through the British colonies in America. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford. He became an Anglican priest and developed a reputation as a powerful preacher, known for his enthusiastic and emotional style. He gained a large following in England and became a popular figure in the religious and social life of London. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America to serve as a missionary to the British colonists. He was initially met with skepticism and even hostility from many of the established clergymen in the colonies, who saw him as a threat to their authority. However, Whitefield's powerful preaching and personal charisma soon won over many audiences, and he became a major figure in the Great Awakening.",
