  "prefix": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an Anglican clergyman who played a significant role in the early days of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the American colonies. He was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. Whitefield was a proponent of the evangelical movement, which emphasized the need for a personal relationship with God and the importance of living a life of holiness. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America as a missionary, and he quickly gained a large following due to his powerful preaching style and his passion for spreading the Gospel. He was particularly effective in reaching out to the colonists who were not affiliated with the established churches, and his itinerant preaching style helped to establish the concept of an \"evangelical circuit\" in the colonies. Whitefield was a friend and colleague of Jonathan Edwards and other prominent evangelical leaders of his time, and he played a key role in the growth and development of the Episcopal Church in America.",
