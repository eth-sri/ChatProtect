  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army (\u7b2c31\u8ecd, Dai-san-gun) was a military unit of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was stationed in Rangoon, Burma, under the control of the Southern Army (\u5357\u8ecd, Nangun). Its main role was to defend against potential Allied amphibious landings along the southern coast of Burma. The Thirty-First Army was primarily composed of troops from Korea, China and Indochina, who were recruited and trained locally. The Thirty-First Army was eventually destroyed by Allied forces during the Battle of Rangoon in early 1945, with the surviving troops being evacuated to Malaya by sea. The commanders of the Thirty-First Army included General Suzuki Tei (\u9234\u6728\u54f2\u91cd), who later served as the last Prime Minister of Japan during the final stages of the war.",
