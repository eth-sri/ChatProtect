  "prefix": "Hellwegb\u00f6rden is a term used in German territorial division and refers to a type of administrative division used in some German states in the Middle Ages. The term \"Hellwegb\u00f6rden\" translates to \"parish boundaries\" in English, and refers to the territorial divisions used by some German states for administrative and ecclesiastical purposes. In the Middle Ages, the Holy Roman Empire was made up of a diverse collection of territories, each of which had their own unique legal and administrative systems. As a result, different systems of territorial division were used in different regions of the empire. One such system was the Hellwegb\u00f6rden system, which was used in the Lower Rhine region and the neighboring areas. The Hellwegb\u00f6rden system was used to divide communities into smaller administrative units for ecclesiastical and judicial purposes. These units were typically based on the boundaries of local parishes, and were known as \"Hellwegb\u00f6rden\" or \"Parish Boundaries.\" The system was used in various forms throughout the Middle Ages, and was eventually replaced by other systems of territorial division in the early modern period. Today, the Hellwegb\u00f6rden system is an interesting historical artifact that provides insight into the territorial divisions and administrative systems of the Middle Ages.",
