Arts and Crafts architects sought to recapture the essence of medieval craftsmanship and to promote the idea of harmony between the arts and crafts themselves, as well as between the building and its surroundings. Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by its use of simple forms, natural materials, and handcrafted details.",
