  "prefix": "The English Arts and Crafts architecture movement emerged in the late 19th century as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution and the mass-produced, standardized architecture that it had brought about. The Arts and Crafts movement emphasized traditional craftsmanship, simple forms, and the use of natural materials, and sought to reconnect architecture with the wider cultural and artistic movements of the time, such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Essex Yeomen. Arts and Crafts buildings were often designed by architects who had trained as artists and artisans, rather than formal architects, and were influenced by British Romanticism and the Gothic Revival. They were characterized by their use of natural materials, such as timber, stone, and brick, and their emphasis on craftsmanship and attention to detail. Arts and Crafts architects also incorporated traditional elements such as gables, chimneys, and ornate brickwork, and often used forms and motifs derived from medieval and Tudor architecture.",
