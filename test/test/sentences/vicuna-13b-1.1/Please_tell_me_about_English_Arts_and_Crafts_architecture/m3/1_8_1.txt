  "prefix": "Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture and design that emerged in the late 19th century in response to the Industrial Revolution and the mass-produced goods that it brought forth. The movement emphasized traditional craftsmanship, simple forms, and the use of natural materials. In England, Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by its use of local materials such as brick, stone, and timber, and its focus on craftsmanship and simplicity of design. The style is often associated with the work of the architect and designer, Charles Voysey, who is considered one of the pioneers of the movement. Voysey's designs often featured simple, geometric forms, earthy colors, and a focus on craftsmanship and materials. Other notable English Arts and Crafts architects include William Morris, who was a founder of the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Philip Webb, who worked with Morris on a number of projects. The style also had a strong influence on the development of the Boy Scout movement, with many Scout camps and buildings designed in the Arts and Crafts style. Some key features of Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n* Use of natural materials: The style often features the use of natural materials, such as wood, stone, and brick, which are used in their raw, unprocessed state to create a sense of connection to nature.",
