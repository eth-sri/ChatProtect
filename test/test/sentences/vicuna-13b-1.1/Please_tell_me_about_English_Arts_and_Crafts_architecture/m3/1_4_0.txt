The movement emphasized traditional craftsmanship, simple forms, and the use of natural materials. In England, Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by its use of local materials such as brick, stone, and timber, and its focus on craftsmanship and simplicity of design. The style is often associated with the work of the architect and designer, Charles Voysey, who is considered one of the pioneers of the movement.",
