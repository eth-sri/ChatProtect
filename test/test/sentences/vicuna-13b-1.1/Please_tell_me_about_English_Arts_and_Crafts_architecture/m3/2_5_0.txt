  "prefix": "The English Arts and Crafts movement, which emerged in the late 19th century, was a reaction against the industrialization of society and the lack of attention to craftsmanship and traditional techniques in architecture. Arts and Crafts architects sought to recapture the essence of medieval craftsmanship and to promote the idea of harmony between the arts and crafts themselves, as well as between the building and its surroundings. Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by its use of simple forms, natural materials, and handcrafted details. Buildings were designed to be in harmony with their surroundings, with emphasis on the use of local materials and traditional construction techniques. Common features of Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n* Simple, clean lines and forms\n* Use of natural materials such as wood, stone, and brick\n* Emphasis on craftsmanship and attention to detail\n* Use of simple, sometimes irregular, massing\n* Organic, curved lines and forms\n* Arts and Crafts style embraced traditional architectural forms such as gables, oriels, and porches\n* Use of decorative elements like textiles, ceramics and stained glass.",
