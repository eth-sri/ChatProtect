  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. Statement 1 simply states that two other judokas won bronze medals, without specifying who they were. Statement 2 provides the specific names of the two judokas who won the bronze medals, which is additional information that complements statement 1. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
