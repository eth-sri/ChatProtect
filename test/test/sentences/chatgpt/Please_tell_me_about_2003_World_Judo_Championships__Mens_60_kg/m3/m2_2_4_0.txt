  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 describes a single-elimination format, where competitors are eliminated after losing a match until only one remains as the winner. Statement 2 describes a round-robin format, where each competitor faces every other competitor in their group, and the winner is determined by the highest number of wins. These are two different tournament formats, and cannot both be true for the same competition."
