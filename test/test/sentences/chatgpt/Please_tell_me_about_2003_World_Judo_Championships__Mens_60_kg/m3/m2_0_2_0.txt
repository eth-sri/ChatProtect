  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory. The first statement provides information about a judoka named Nomura, who is a seven-time world champion in judo. The second statement specifically mentions Nomura Tadahiro as the gold medalist in the Men's 60 kg category at the 2003 World Judo Championships. It is possible that Nomura Tadahiro is the same person referred to in the first statement, as he is a well-known judoka who has won multiple world championships. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
