  "prefix": "C. T. Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was a prominent American pediatric hematologist who made significant contributions to the field of blood transfusion and the treatment of anemia in children. He was born on May 16, 1883, in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan spent most of his career at the Children's Hospital in Boston, where he worked as a physician and researcher for over 40 years. He specialized in the study of blood disorders in children, particularly anemia, and developed new techniques for blood transfusion and the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia. One of Blackfan's most notable discoveries was the identification of a new type of anemia that he named \"hypoplastic anemia.\"",
