  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original text, removing the mention of Blackfan's birth year, while Statement 2 mentions the uncertainty regarding Blackfan's birth year, citing different sources that suggest 1883 and 1882 as possible birth years. These statements do not contradict each other, and both provide valid information about C.T. Blackfan."
