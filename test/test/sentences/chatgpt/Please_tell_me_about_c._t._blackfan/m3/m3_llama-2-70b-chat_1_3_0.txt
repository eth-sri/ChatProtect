  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 rephrases the original sentence, removing the mention of Blackfan's nationality and field of work, while still retaining the essential information that Blackfan is known for his work in blood transfusion and anemia treatment.\n\nStatement 2 removes the unnecessary information about Blackfan's personal life, which is not relevant to the topic of his professional achievements.\n\nTherefore, both statements provide helpful and accurate information about C.T. Blackfan, and they do not contain any contradictions."
