  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original text, removing the mention of Blackfan's birth year, while Statement 2 mentions the discrepancy in sources regarding Blackfan's birth year, but does not provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other, and both can be considered valid."
