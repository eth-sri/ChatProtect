  "orig": "One of Blackfan's most notable discoveries was the identification of a new type of anemia that he named \"hypoplastic anemia.\"",
  "alt": "What is hypoplastic anemia and how is it different from other types of anemia? Hypoplastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the bone marrow. This results in a decrease in the production of blood cells, leading to fatigue, weakness, and an increased risk of infections and bleeding. Hypoplastic anemia is different from other types of anemia, such as iron-deficiency anemia, which is caused by a lack of iron in the body, and sickle cell anemia, which is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the shape of red blood cells.",
  "prefix": "C. T. Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was a prominent American pediatric hematologist who made significant contributions to the field of blood transfusion and the treatment of anemia in children. He was born on May 16, 1883, in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan spent most of his career at the Children's Hospital in Boston, where he worked as a physician and researcher for over 40 years. He specialized in the study of blood disorders in children, particularly anemia, and developed new techniques for blood transfusion and the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia.",
