He is known for his research on blood and the discovery of the anemia disease in infants. During his career, Blackfan studied medicine at Harvard University and eventually became a professor there. He was also a member of the American Pediatric Society and the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. In 1910, Blackfan made a significant discovery by identifying a form of anemia that affected newborn infants. The disease was later named after him and his colleague, Louis Diamond, and is called Blackfan-Diamond anemia. Blackfan also worked on understanding the causes of hemolytic disease in newborns, which occurs when a mother's antibodies attack her fetus's red blood cells.",
