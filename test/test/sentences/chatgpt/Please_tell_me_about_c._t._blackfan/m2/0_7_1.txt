  "orig": "Blackfan also worked on understanding the causes of hemolytic disease in newborns, which occurs when a mother's antibodies attack her fetus's red blood cells.",
  "alt": "What is hemolytic disease in newborns and what causes it? I'm sorry, but the question is not related to the information provided about C.T. Blackfan. However, to answer your question, hemolytic disease in newborns is a condition where the mother's antibodies attack the baby's red blood cells, leading to anemia and other complications. It is caused by a mismatch in blood types between the mother and the baby, where the mother's immune system sees the baby's blood cells as foreign and produces antibodies to destroy them. This condition can be prevented with proper medical care during pregnancy and after birth.",
  "prefix": "C.T. Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was an American physician who lived from 1883 to 1963. He is known for his research on blood and the discovery of the anemia disease in infants. During his career, Blackfan studied medicine at Harvard University and eventually became a professor there. He was also a member of the American Pediatric Society and the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. In 1910, Blackfan made a significant discovery by identifying a form of anemia that affected newborn infants. The disease was later named after him and his colleague, Louis Diamond, and is called Blackfan-Diamond anemia.",
