  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 states that Ke Apon Ke Por is a popular Bengali television serial that airs on Zee Bangla, while Statement 2 states that it airs on Star Jalsha. This conflicting information makes it difficult to provide a clear answer to the question without further clarification or additional information.\n\nIt's important to note that providing accurate and reliable information is crucial in maintaining the trust and credibility of the assistant. Therefore, I would refrain from answering the question until I have access to more reliable sources that can confirm the correct channel for the serial.\n\nIn the meantime, I suggest seeking additional information or clarification from the user, such as the time period when the serial aired or any other relevant details that can help in verifying the correct channel. This approach will ensure that the assistant provides accurate and reliable information while maintaining a safe and respectful conversation."
