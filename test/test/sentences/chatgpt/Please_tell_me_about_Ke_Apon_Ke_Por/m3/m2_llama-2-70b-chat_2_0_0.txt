  "explanation": " The two statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements describe the program as a popular Bengali television show, with the first statement calling it a \"serial\" and the second statement calling it a \"soap opera.\" These terms are often used interchangeably to describe a continuing drama or story told in episodes, so both statements are accurately describing the same program."
