  "prefix": " Ke Apon Ke Por is a popular Bengali television drama series that airs on Star Jalsha. The show premiered on 25 July 2016 and has since become a huge hit among Bengali viewers. The show revolves around the character of Joba, a strong and independent woman who is the only breadwinner of her family. Sure, here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and preserves the valid information:\n\nJoba is a strong and independent woman. This sentence still conveys the idea that Joba is a capable and self-sufficient person, which fits well with the description of the show.",

  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 explains that the mention of Joba being the only breadwinner of her family has been removed from the revised sentence, as it conflicts with the introduction of her husband Param in the show. This statement does not contradict the information provided in the original sentence, but rather clarifies the context to avoid any confusion.\n\nStatement 2 states that the given sentence does not provide enough context to fill in the gap, and therefore, it is not possible to generate a new sentence based on the provided prompt. This statement does not contradict the information provided in the original sentence either, but rather acknowledges the limitation of the given prompt.\n\nTherefore, the statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory."
