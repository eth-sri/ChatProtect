  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions that Ke Apon Ke Por is a popular Bengali television serial that airs on Star Jalsha, while Statement 2 describes it as a popular Bengali television soap opera. Both statements are providing information about the same topic, but they use different terms to describe it. \"Television serial\" and \"soap opera\" are often used interchangeably to refer to a continuing drama that is broadcast on television. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both provide valid information about Ke Apon Ke Por."
