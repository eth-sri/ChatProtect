Wen Tianxiang is best known for his unwavering loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty, which was in decline due to the relentless attacks of the Mongol empire. In 1275, Wen became one of the most influential figures in the Song court. He was banished from the court. Despite this setback, he refused to abandon his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty and organized a resistance movement against the invading Mongols. In 1278, Wen was captured by the Mongols and was executed in 1283.",
