  "explanation": " The two statements provided about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that Wen was captured by the Mongol forces during the siege of Hangzhou in 1276, while Statement 2 states that Wen was taken as a prisoner to the capital of the Yuan dynasty in 1276. Both statements agree that Wen was captured by the Mongols in 1276, but they provide different details about what happened to him after his capture. Statement 1 does not mention anything about Wen being taken to the Yuan capital, while Statement 2 does not mention anything about the siege of Hangzhou. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather provide complementary information about Wen Tianxiang's experiences during the Mongol invasion."
