Wen Tianxiang was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China. He passed the imperial examination, a qualification for high-ranking government officials, at the age of 26. He subsequently served in various government positions, including as the governor of Fujian Province. During the Mongol invasion of China in the late 13th century, Wen Tianxiang was appointed as a military general and led troops against the invaders. When the Song Dynasty was defeated and the Mongols established the Yuan Dynasty, Wen refused to surrender and fled to the hills, where he continued to resist the Mongol rule. Wen Tianxiang was captured by the Mongols and was offered a high-ranking position in their government if he agreed to collaborate with them.",
