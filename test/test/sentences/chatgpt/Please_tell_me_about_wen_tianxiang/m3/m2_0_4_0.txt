  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. The text mentions that Wen Tianxiang was a loyalist to the Southern Song dynasty, which was under attack by the Mongol empire. Statement 2 explains that he was banished by the Mongol empire after refusing to surrender to them, which is consistent with his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty. Statement 1 further supports this by indicating that he was banished from the court, likely due to his refusal to compromise his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty."
