  "prefix": "Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, calligrapher, military general, and loyalist statesman during the final years of the Song dynasty. He was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, during the reign of Emperor Lizong of Song. Wen Tianxiang was known for his patriotism and loyalty to the Song dynasty. He served as a military advisor to the Emperor and was an outspoken critic of the Mongol invasion. During the Mongol siege of the Song capital, Hangzhou, in 1276, Wen refused to surrender and was captured by the Mongol forces. He was brought to the Mongol capital, Dadu (present-day Beijing), and was sentenced to death for his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Despite being tortured and offered clemency if he renounced his loyalty to the Song dynasty, Wen refused to yield and continued to write patriotic poems in his cell. He was eventually executed by the Mongols, and his death led to a wave of admiration and devotion among his fellow people.",
