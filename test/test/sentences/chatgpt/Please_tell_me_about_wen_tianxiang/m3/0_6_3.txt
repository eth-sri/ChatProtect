He was born in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, during the reign of Emperor Lizong. Wen Tianxiang is best known for his unwavering loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty, which was in decline due to the relentless attacks of the Mongol empire. In 1275, Wen was appointed as the chancellor and became one of the most influential figures in the Song court. However, he was later accused of conspiracy and was banished from the court. Despite this setback, he refused to abandon his loyalty to the Southern Song dynasty and organized a resistance movement against the invading Mongols.",
