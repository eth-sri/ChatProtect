  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 focuses on Wen Tianxiang's role as chancellor of the Southern Song dynasty during Emperor Lizong's reign, which is a factual piece of information.\n\nStatement 2 removes the word \"scholar\" from the description of Wen Tianxiang, which does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1. It is possible for someone to be a military leader and a loyalist without being a scholar, so this revision does not introduce any contradictory information.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory."
