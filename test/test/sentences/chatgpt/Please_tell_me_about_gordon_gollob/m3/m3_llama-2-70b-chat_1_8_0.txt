  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 suggests that Gordon Gollob joined the German Luftwaffe in 1933 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 331 (JG 331), a fighter squadron. However, the revised sentence in Statement 2 removes the conflicting information about Gollob's nationality and only states that he was a fighter pilot during World War II, without mentioning any specific country or squadron.\n\nTherefore, the statements are contradictory, as Statement 1 provides specific information about Gollob's affiliation with the German Luftwaffe and JG 331, while Statement 2 removes that information and only states that he was a fighter pilot during World War II."
