During World War II, Gollob became one of the most successful fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe.

He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, the highest military honor in Germany at the time.

He was also known for his leadership skills and was promoted to the rank of Major in 1943. In 1944, Gollob was injured in a flying accident and was unable to fly for the rest of the war.",
