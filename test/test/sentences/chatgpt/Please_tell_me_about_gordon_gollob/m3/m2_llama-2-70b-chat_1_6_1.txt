  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions that Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1933 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 331 (JG 331), a fighter squadron. Statement 2 states that in 1933, when the Luftwaffe was established, Gollob was assigned to the fighter pilot division.\n\nBoth statements agree that Gollob was part of the Luftwaffe in 1933, and they both mention his role as a fighter pilot. The information in Statement 2 is a bit more general, as it only mentions that Gollob was assigned to the fighter pilot division, while Statement 1 provides more specific information about the squadron he was assigned to.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both contribute to our understanding of Gordon Gollob's role in the Luftwaffe during World War II."
