Statement 1 revised the original sentence to specify that Gordon Gollob was a German fighter pilot, while Statement 2 explains that the revision was made to remove conflicting information about Gollob's nationality and preserve the accuracy of the description. Both statements agree that Gollob was a fighter pilot during World War II, and the revised sentence in Statement 1 provides more specific information about his nationality. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
