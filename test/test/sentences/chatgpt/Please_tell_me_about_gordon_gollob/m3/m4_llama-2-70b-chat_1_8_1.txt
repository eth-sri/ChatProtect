  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions that Gollob served in the Luftwaffe during World War II, which is a factual piece of information that is not disputed. Statement 2 provides an explanation for the conflicting information about Gollob's nationality, stating that Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany during the war. This information does not contradict Statement 1, but rather provides context for why there may be confusion about Gollob's nationality. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
