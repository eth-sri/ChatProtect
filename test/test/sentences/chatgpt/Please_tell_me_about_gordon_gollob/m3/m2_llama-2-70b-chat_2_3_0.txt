  "explanation": " The two statements provided are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that Gordon Gollob was a fighter pilot during World War II, without specifying his nationality. The second statement reveals that he was a German fighter pilot during the same war. This additional information does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides more specific details about Gollob's background. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of who Gordon Gollob was."
