  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. The first statement says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1937, while the second statement says that he joined the Austrian Air Force in 1933. Since the Luftwaffe was the air force of Nazi Germany, it is unlikely that Gollob would have joined it before it was established in 1935, which contradicts the second statement that he joined the Austrian Air Force in 1933. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
