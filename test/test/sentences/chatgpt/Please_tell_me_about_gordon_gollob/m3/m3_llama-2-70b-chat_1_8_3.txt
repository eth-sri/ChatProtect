  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 states that Gollob joined the German Luftwaffe in 1933 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 331 (JG 331), a fighter squadron. However, Statement 2 states that Gollob was assigned to the German Luftwaffe in 1933.\n\nThe conflicting information lies in the fact that Statement 1 specifies that Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1933 and was assigned to a specific fighter squadron, while Statement 2 simply states that Gollob was assigned to the Luftwaffe in 1933 without providing any additional details.\n\nTherefore, the statements are contradictory, and it is not possible to determine which statement is accurate without further information. It is important to note that it is not appropriate to make assumptions or provide false information, so it is best to seek additional sources to clarify the conflicting information."
