  "prefix": "Gordon Gollob was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II. He was born on June 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria. Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 331 (JG 331), a fighter squadron. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a squadron leader in 1939. Gollob was a skilled fighter pilot and was credited with 150 aerial victories during his career. He was known for his aggressive tactics and was often sent on missions to take out enemy aircraft before they could attack German bombers. In 1942, Gollob was promoted to the rank of Major and was given command of JG 77, a fighter wing. He led his wing in many successful missions, including the defense of Sicily and the Battle of Kursk. However, Gollob's career was cut short in 1944 when he was injured in a flying accident. He was forced to retire from active service and spent the rest of the war working as a test pilot. After the war, Gollob was imprisoned by the Allies but was eventually released in 1947.",
