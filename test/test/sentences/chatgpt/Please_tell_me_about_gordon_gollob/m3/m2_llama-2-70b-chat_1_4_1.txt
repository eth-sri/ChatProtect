Statement 1 describes him as a German Luftwaffe fighter ace, while Statement 2 states that the conflicting information about his nationality was removed to preserve the accuracy of the description.\n\nWithout additional information, it is not possible to determine which statement is accurate. It is possible that Gollob was a German pilot who flew for the Luftwaffe, or he may have been a pilot from another country who fought on the Allied side.\n\nTo provide a more accurate answer, further research or clarification would be necessary. It's important to be cautious when providing information to avoid perpetuating misinformation or spreading potentially harmful content."
