Here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and preserves as much valid information as possible:\n\nGordon Gollob was a fighter pilot during World War II. This sentence still conveys that Gordon Gollob was a pilot during World War II, but it removes the conflicting information about his nationality. He was born on June 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria.",

  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 describes Gordon Gollob as a German Luftwaffe fighter ace, while Statement 2 states that he was a fighter pilot during World War II without specifying a nationality. This inconsistency suggests that the statements are contradictory, as they cannot both be accurate if they refer to the same person.\n\nIt's important to note that without additional information, it's difficult to determine which statement is correct or if either statement is accurate. Further research or context would be necessary to provide a clear answer."
