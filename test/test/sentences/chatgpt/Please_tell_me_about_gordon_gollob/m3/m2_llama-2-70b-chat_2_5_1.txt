  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information about Gordon Gollob's nationality. Statement 1 states that Gollob was a German fighter pilot, while Statement 2 states that he was born in Vienna, Austria. This is a contradiction because Germany and Austria are two different countries with different nationalities. Therefore, it is not possible for Gordon Gollob to have been both a German fighter pilot and born in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIt's important to note that the conflicting information has been removed in the revised sentence provided in the question, which now accurately states that Gordon Gollob was a German fighter pilot born in Wroc\u0142aw, then part of Germany. This revised sentence preserves as much valid information as possible while removing the conflicting information."
