  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original sentence, removing the mention of Gollob's nationality, while still conveying that he was a fighter pilot during World War II. Statement 2 correctly states that a revised sentence should remove conflicting information and preserve valid information.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both contribute to providing accurate and helpful information about Gordon Gollob."
