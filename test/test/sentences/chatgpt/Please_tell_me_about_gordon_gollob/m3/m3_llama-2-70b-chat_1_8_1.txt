  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions that Gollob joined the German Luftwaffe in 1933 and was assigned to a fighter squadron, which suggests that he was a pilot for the German military during World War II. Statement 2 explains that the conflicting information about Gollob's nationality may have arisen due to the fact that Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany during the war, which does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
