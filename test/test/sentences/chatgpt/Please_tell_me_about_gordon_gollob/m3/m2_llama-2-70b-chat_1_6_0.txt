  "explanation": " The two statements provided about Gordon Gollob are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 states that Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1933 and was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 331 (JG 331), a fighter squadron. This implies that Gollob was a member of the German military and fought for the Nazi regime during World War II.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, states that Gollob joined the Austrian Air Force in 1933. This suggests that Gollob was a member of the Austrian military, which was separate from the German military during World War II.\n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different military affiliations for Gollob during the same time period."
