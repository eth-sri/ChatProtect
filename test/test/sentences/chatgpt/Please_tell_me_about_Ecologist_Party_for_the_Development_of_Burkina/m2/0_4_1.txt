As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific policies and actions of the PEDB. However, it is common for political parties with an environmental focus to also prioritize social justice and human rights, as these issues are often interconnected. For example, addressing environmental degradation can improve the health and livelihoods of marginalized communities, and promoting sustainable development can create economic opportunities for those who have been historically disadvantaged. It is possible that the PEDB has developed policies and initiatives that address both environmental and social issues in a holistic manner.",
