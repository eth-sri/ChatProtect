  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contradict each other. Statement 1 provides a revised sentence that removes conflicting information and preserves valid information about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina Faso (PEDB), stating that it is a political party in Burkina Faso. Statement 2 states that the conflicting information about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina Faso preserves its true political stance. This statement does not contradict the first statement, as it does not provide any new information that contradicts the revised sentence. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
