  "prefix": "Faso. The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina Faso (PED-BF) is a political party in Burkina Faso. It was founded in 1990 by a group of environmentalists and human rights activists. The party aims to promote sustainable development and protect the environment in Burkina Faso. PED-BF has participated in several national elections since its formation. In the 2015 presidential election, the party's candidate, Tibebe Samuel Ferenji, received less than 1% of the vote. The party has also been involved in local politics, with its members serving on municipal councils in several cities including Ouagadougou, the capital. The party's platform includes a focus on ecological sustainability, social justice, and democracy. Some of its key policy proposals include increasing investment in renewable energy, promoting organic agriculture, and improving access to clean water. The party has faced criticism for being too focused on environmental issues and not addressing other concerns such as poverty and economic development.",
