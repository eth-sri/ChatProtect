The first statement provides additional context by specifying that the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (PEDB) is a political party in Burkina Faso, while the second statement simply states that the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina is a political party in Burkina Faso. The information in the second statement is a subset of the information provided in the first statement, and therefore, they are not contradictory."
