  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina Faso (PEDB) are not contradictory. The first statement provides a factual description of the party as a political party in Burkina Faso, while the second statement highlights the party's unique focus on environmental issues, which distinguishes it from traditional political parties that often prioritize other issues. The second statement does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides additional information about the party's focus and approach to politics. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both contribute to a better understanding of the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina Faso."
