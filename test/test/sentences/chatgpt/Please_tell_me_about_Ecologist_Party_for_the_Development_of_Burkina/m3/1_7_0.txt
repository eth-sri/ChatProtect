The party advocates for responsible mining practices, protection of forests and other ecosystems, and sustainable agriculture. The party also champions the rights of women and marginalized groups, and calls for the reduction of poverty and inequality in Burkina Faso. It has called for the government to invest more in education and healthcare, and to work towards greater food security for the population. At present, PEDB has limited representation in the National Assembly of Burkina Faso.",
