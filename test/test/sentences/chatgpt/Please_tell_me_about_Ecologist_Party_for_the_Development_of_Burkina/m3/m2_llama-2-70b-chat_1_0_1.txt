  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not appear to be contradictory. Statement 1 provides a revised sentence that removes conflicting information and preserves valid information about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (PEDB), stating that it is a political party in Burkina Faso.

However, it is important to note that political parties' stances and positions can evolve over time, and it is possible that the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina may have changed its political stance since the statements were made. Therefore, it is always important to verify information through multiple sources to ensure accuracy and up-to-date information."
