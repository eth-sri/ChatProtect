Statement 1 provides a revised sentence that removes conflicting information and preserves valid information about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (PEDB), stating that it is a political party in Burkina Faso that focuses on environmental issues and sustainable development. Statement 2 apologizes for the prompt not making sense and requests a new prompt. The statements do not contradict each other, and Statement 2 does not provide any information that contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
