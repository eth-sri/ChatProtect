  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that the PEDB is a political party in Burkina Faso. However, statement 1 provides additional information about the party's founding year, which statement 2 does not include. Therefore, the two statements are complementary rather than contradictory."
