  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the home was later donated to the Tallahassee Junior Museum, but it does not specify when this happened. Statement 2 mentions that the Bailey family sold the house to the Thompson family in 1922, which could have been before or after the donation to the museum. Therefore, both statements can be true without contradicting each other."
