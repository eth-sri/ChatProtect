  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. The first statement clearly states that the house was built in 1855 by Dr. Jesse Bailey, while the second statement claims that it was built in 1850. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different dates for the construction of the house."
