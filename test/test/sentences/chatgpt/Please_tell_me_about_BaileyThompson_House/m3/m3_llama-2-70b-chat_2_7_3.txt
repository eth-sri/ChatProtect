  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 states that the house remained in the possession of the Ponder family until 1867, when it was sold to the Bailey-Thompson family.\n\nStatement 2 states that the house was sold to the Thompson family in 1866 and remained in their possession for over a century.\n\nThe contradiction lies in the fact that Statement 1 mentions the house being sold to the Bailey-Thompson family in 1867, while Statement 2 states that it was sold to the Thompson family in 1866. The discrepancy in the date of the sale and the name of the family who purchased the house suggests that the statements are not consistent with each other."
