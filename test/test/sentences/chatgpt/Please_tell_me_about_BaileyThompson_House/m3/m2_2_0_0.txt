  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the house was built in 1885 for attorney Charles H. Bailey, while statement 2 suggests that it was built in 1837 in the Greek Revival style. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the date and style of the house's construction."
