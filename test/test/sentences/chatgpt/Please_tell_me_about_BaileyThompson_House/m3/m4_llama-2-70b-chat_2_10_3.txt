  "explanation": " The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 states that the house remained in the possession of the Bailey-Thompson family for over a century until it was donated to the Tallahassee Historical Society in 1971.\n\nStatement 2 states that the house was donated to the Talladega County Historical Association in 1973.\n\nThese two statements contradict each other as they both claim to know the fate of the Bailey-Thompson House after it was donated, but they provide different information. Statement 1 says it was donated to the Tallahassee Historical Society, while Statement 2 says it was donated to the Talladega County Historical Association.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true, and they are considered contradictory."
