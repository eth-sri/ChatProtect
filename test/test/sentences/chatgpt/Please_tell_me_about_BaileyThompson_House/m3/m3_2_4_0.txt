  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. The first statement simply states that the Bailey family sold the home, without specifying who they sold it to. The second statement provides additional information by specifying that the Bailey family sold the house to the Thompson family in 1920. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and do not contradict each other."
