Statement 1 states that the Bailey family sold the home to the Thompson family, who then donated it to the Tallahassee Junior Museum. Statement 2 confirms that the home was indeed donated to the Tallahassee Junior Museum, but does not mention the intermediate sale to the Thompson family. Therefore, both statements can be considered accurate and consistent with each other."
