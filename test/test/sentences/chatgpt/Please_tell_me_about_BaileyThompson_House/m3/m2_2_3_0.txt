  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. They both describe additions made to the house at different times. Statement 1 mentions a one-story wing added in the early 1900s, while Statement 2 mentions a two-story rear wing added in 1905. These are two separate additions and do not contradict each other."
