  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions that the Bailey family sold the home to the Thompson family in 1928, while Statement 2 mentions that the home was donated to the Tallahassee Junior Museum. It is possible that the Thompson family donated the home to the museum, so the statements do not conflict. Additionally, the photograph provided in Statement 2 supports the information in Statement 1 by showing the home's appearance during the early 1900s, which is consistent with the time period mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
