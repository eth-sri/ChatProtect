  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 states that the Bailey-Thompson House is a historic house located in Talladega, Alabama, implying that it still retains its historical designation. However, Statement 2 reveals that the house was moved from its original location in 1975, which resulted in the removal of its historical designation. Therefore, the statements are contradictory, and it is unclear whether the Bailey-Thompson House still retains its historical status."
