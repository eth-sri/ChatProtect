The fa\u00e7ade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L.

  "explanation": " The two statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the house is currently open to the public as a museum, allowing visitors to explore its historic significance and architectural beauty. Statement 2 mentions that the house is open for public tours and events. Both statements convey that the house is accessible to the public, but they emphasize different aspects of its accessibility. Statement 1 focuses on the educational and cultural value of the house as a museum, while Statement 2 highlights its availability for events and tours. Therefore, the statements are complementary and not contradictory."
