  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the house was built in 1847 by William G. Ponder, while Statement 2 states that it was built in 1885. The 40-year discrepancy between the two dates suggests that at least one of the statements is incorrect. It is possible that one of the statements is a typo or a misinterpretation of historical records. Without further information, it is difficult to determine which statement is accurate."
