  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 mentions the Bailey-Thompson House being located in Tallahassee, Florida, while Statement 2 states that it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which suggests that it is a nationally recognized historic site. However, the National Register of Historic Places does not list buildings located in Tallahassee, Florida. Therefore, it is unclear which location is accurate. To provide a helpful response, further research or clarification is needed to determine the correct location of the Bailey-Thompson House."
