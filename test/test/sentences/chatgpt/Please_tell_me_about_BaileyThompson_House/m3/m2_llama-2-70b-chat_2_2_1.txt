  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 states that the Bailey family purchased the home in 1870 and remained in their possession for over a century, implying that the Bailey family owned the house from 1870 to 1970.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, states that Bailey remained the owner of the house until 1860, which is ten years before the Bailey family purchased the house according to Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true, as they provide different information about the ownership history of the Bailey-Thompson House."
