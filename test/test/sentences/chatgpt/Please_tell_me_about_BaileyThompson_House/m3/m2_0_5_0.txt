  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the original front porch was enclosed with a balustrade in 1907, while statement 2 says that the original porch was enclosed with a one-story addition in 1900. These two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different alterations made to the original porch."
