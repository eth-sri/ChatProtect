  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions the Bailey family selling the home to the Thompson family in 1928, while Statement 2 mentions the home being donated to the Tallahassee Junior Museum. It is possible that the Thompson family donated the home to the museum, so the statements do not necessarily contradict each other. However, without additional information, it is unclear whether the statements are describing the same event or two separate events in the history of the Bailey-Thompson House."
