  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. The first statement states that the historic home is located in Talladega, Alabama, while the second statement states that it is located in Tallahassee, Florida. These two cities are in different states, which means that the same house cannot be located in both places. Therefore, one of the statements must be incorrect."
