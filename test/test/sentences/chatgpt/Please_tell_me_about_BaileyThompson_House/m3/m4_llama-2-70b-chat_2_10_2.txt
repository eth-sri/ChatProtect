  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that the house remained in the possession of the Bailey-Thompson family for over a century until it was donated to the Tallahassee Historical Society in 1971. Statement 2 states that the house remained unoccupied for several years before being restored and opened to the public as a museum. These two statements can coexist without any contradiction, as the period of unoccupancy could have occurred after the house was donated to the historical society. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
