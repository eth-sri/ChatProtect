  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 states that George L. Thompson made modifications to the house in 1907, while Statement 2 claims that he made significant renovations in the 1850s, adding a two-story rear wing and a new front entrance with a cast-iron balcony. The two statements cannot both be true, as they refer to different time periods and levels of renovation."
