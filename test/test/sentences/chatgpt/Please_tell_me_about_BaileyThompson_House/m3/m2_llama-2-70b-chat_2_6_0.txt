  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 states that the home remained in the possession of the Bailey-Thompson family for over a century, implying that the family owned the home for a significant period of time.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, states that the home remained in the Ponder family until 1867, which suggests that the Ponder family owned the home until that year.\n\nThese two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different families owning the home during different time periods. Therefore, they are contradictory."
