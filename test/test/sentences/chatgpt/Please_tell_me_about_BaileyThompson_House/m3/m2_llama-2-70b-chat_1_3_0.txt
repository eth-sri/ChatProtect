Statement 1 specifies the exact year of construction (1850) and the architectural style (Greek Revival), while Statement 2 provides a broader time frame (mid-19th century) without mentioning the architectural style. Therefore, Statement 2 does not contradict Statement 1, and both can be considered accurate and complementary pieces of information about the Bailey\u2013Thompson House."
