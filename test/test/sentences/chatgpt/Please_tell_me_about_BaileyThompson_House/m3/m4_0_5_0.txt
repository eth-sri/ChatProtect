  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. The first statement mentions modifications made to the house in 1907, which could have been minor changes or renovations. The second statement mentions modifications made in the 20th century to convert the house into a museum, which could have been a more significant transformation. Both statements can be true without contradicting each other."
