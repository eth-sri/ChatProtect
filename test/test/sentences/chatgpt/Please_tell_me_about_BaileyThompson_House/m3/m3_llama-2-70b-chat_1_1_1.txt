  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information regarding the construction date of the Bailey-Thompson House. Statement 1 mentions that the house is located in Talladega, Alabama, without specifying a construction date. Statement 2, on the other hand, mentions that there is conflicting information about the construction date, with some sources claiming it was built in 1796 and others stating it was constructed in 1810.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not necessarily contradictory, but rather complementary. Statement 1 provides general information about the location of the Bailey-Thompson House, while Statement 2 provides more specific information about the conflicting accounts of its construction date."
