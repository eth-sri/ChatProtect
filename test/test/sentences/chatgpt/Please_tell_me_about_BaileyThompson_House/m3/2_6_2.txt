The home is a two-story, Greek Revival-style building with a large central hall and six rooms on each floor. In 1891, the home was purchased by the Bailey family, who lived there for many years. During their ownership, they added a two-story wing to the rear of the home, doubling its size. In 1959, the Bailey family sold the home to the Thompson family, who subsequently donated it to the Tallahassee Junior Museum.",
