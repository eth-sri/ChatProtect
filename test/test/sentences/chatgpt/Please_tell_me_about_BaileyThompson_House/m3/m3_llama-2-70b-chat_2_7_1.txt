Statement 1 provides additional information about the history of the home, specifically that it remained in the possession of the Ponder family until 1867, when it was sold to the Bailey-Thompson family. This information does not conflict with the revised sentence that describes the home's location, architecture, and history. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the Bailey-Thompson House."
