  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the house remained in the possession of the Bailey-Thompson family for over a century until it was donated to the Tallahassee Historical Society in 1971, while Statement 2 states that the house remained in the possession of the Thompson family for over a century until 1966. The difference in the names of the families mentioned in the two statements (Bailey-Thompson vs. Thompson) is not necessarily a contradiction, as it is possible that the family name changed over time or that there was a connection between the Bailey and Thompson families. Additionally, the time periods mentioned in the two statements overlap, but do not necessarily contradict each other. Therefore, the statements can be considered compatible and not contradictory."
