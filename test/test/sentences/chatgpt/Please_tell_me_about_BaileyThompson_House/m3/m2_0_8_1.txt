  "prefix": "This two-story, Federal-style brick house was built in 1820 for Gabriel Bailey, a prominent member of the community who served as a state delegate, senator, and U.S. Congressman. The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico. The fa\u00e7ade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who added the rear wings and enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade. His descendants occupied the house until 1968. The Bailey\u2013Thompson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historical significance as an example of Federal-style architecture and its association with Gabriel Bailey and George L. Thompson.",
