  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 states that the house remained in the possession of the Ponder family until 1867, when it was sold to the Bailey-Thompson family. This implies that the Ponder family owned the house for at least 20 years, from its construction in 1847 until 1867.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, states that the house remained in the Ponder family until 1907. This implies that the Ponder family owned the house for a longer period of time, from its construction in 1847 until 1907, which is 60 years.\n\nTherefore, there is a discrepancy between the two statements regarding the length of time the Ponder family owned the Bailey-Thompson House. To resolve this contradiction, further research or clarification would be needed to determine the accurate length of time the Ponder family owned the house."
