  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that the house remained in the possession of the Thompson family for over a century until 1966, while Statement 2 states that the house remained in private ownership until it was donated to the Talladega County Historical Association in 1973. These statements can coexist as they are describing different aspects of the house's history. Statement 1 focuses on the Thompson family's ownership, while Statement 2 provides information about the house's ownership after it was donated to the historical association. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
