The home is a two-story, Greek Revival-style building with a large central hall and six rooms on each floor. The home was purchased by the Bailey family in 1870 and remained in their possession for over a century. During their ownership, they added a two-story wing to the rear of the home, doubling its size.",

  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that the Bailey family sold the home to the Thompson family, who then donated it to the Tallahassee Junior Museum. Statement 2 provides a specific year, 1973, for when the Bailey family sold the house to the Thompson family.\n\nIt is possible that the Thompson family donated the house to the museum after purchasing it from the Bailey family in 1973, which would not contradict either statement. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, and both can be true."
