  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that the home was purchased by the Bailey family in 1870 and remained in their possession for over a century, while Statement 2 states that the home was purchased by the state of Florida in 1971 and is now used as a museum. These statements can coexist as they describe different periods of time in the history of the house. The Bailey family owned the house for over a century, and then the state of Florida purchased it in 1971, which means that the house was owned by the Bailey family and then later became a museum. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
