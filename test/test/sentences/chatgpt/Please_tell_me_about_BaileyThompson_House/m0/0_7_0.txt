This two-story, Federal-style brick house was built in 1820 for Gabriel Bailey, a prominent member of the community who served as a state delegate, senator, and U.S. Congressman. The house features a central pavilion with a pedimented portico supported by four Tuscan columns. The fa\u00e7ade is symmetrically composed, with a fanlight over the entrance, sash windows with molded surrounds, and false shutters. The house is topped by a hip roof with chimneys placed on either side of the building. In 1907, the house was purchased by George L. Thompson, a local businessman and banker, who added the rear wings and enclosed the original front porch with a balustrade.",
