The two-story Greek Revival-style house is made of brick and features a front porch with six Doric columns. The house was used as a hospital during the Civil War, and was later purchased by F. E. Thompson, a prominent businessman. Thompson made several modifications to the house, including installing gas lighting and adding a two-story wing to the rear of the house. The Bailey\u2013Thompson House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Today, it is used as a museum and event space, showcasing the history of Talladega and the surrounding area.",
