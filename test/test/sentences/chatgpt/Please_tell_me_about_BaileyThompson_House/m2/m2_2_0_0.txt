  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the house was built in 1885 for attorney Charles H. Bailey, while statement 2 claims that it was built for William Bailey, a wealthy merchant, in the early 1800s. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the original owner and the time period in which the house was built."
