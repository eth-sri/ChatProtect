He believed that children learn best when they are given the freedom to explore their interests and passions, and that traditional schooling often stifles creativity and curiosity. Holt wrote several influential books on education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981). In these books, he argued that children are natural learners who are capable of teaching themselves if given the right environment and resources.",
