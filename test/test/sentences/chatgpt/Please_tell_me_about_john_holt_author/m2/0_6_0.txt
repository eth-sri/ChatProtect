  "prefix": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that traditional schooling was harmful to children's natural love of learning and that children should be allowed to learn at their own pace and in their own way. Holt began his career as a teacher in the 1950s, but became disillusioned with the traditional education system and began to write about his ideas for reform. His first book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964 and became a bestseller. In it, Holt argued that the traditional approach to education was failing children by discouraging their natural curiosity and creativity. Holt went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn\" (1967), \"Freedom and Beyond\" (1972), and \"Instead of Education\" (1976).",
