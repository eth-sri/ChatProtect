Holt wrote several influential books on education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981). In these books, he argued that children are natural learners who are capable of teaching themselves if given the right environment and resources. Holt also founded the magazine \"Growing Without Schooling\" in 1977, which became a leading resource for homeschooling families.",
