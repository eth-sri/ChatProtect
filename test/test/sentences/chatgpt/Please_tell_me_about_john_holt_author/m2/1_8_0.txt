  "prefix": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who was known for his advocacy of homeschooling and alternative education. He was born in New York City and attended Yale University, where he earned a degree in English literature. After serving in World War II, he worked as a teacher in several public schools, but became disillusioned with the traditional education system and began to explore alternative approaches. Holt's first book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964 and became a bestseller. In it, he argued that the traditional education system was failing children by emphasizing rote learning and memorization over creativity and critical thinking. He went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Instead of Education.\" In the 1970s, Holt became a leading advocate of homeschooling, which he saw as a way for parents to provide their children with a more personalized and flexible education. He founded the magazine \"Growing Without Schooling\" and wrote extensively on the subject of homeschooling and unschooling.",
