He was born in New York City and attended Yale University, where he earned a degree in English literature. After serving in World War II, he worked as a teacher in several public schools, but became disillusioned with the traditional education system and began to explore alternative approaches. Holt's first book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964 and became a bestseller. In it, he argued that the traditional education system was failing children by emphasizing rote learning and memorization over creativity and critical thinking. He went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Instead of Education.\"",
