  "prefix": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that children learn best when they are given the freedom to explore their interests and passions, and that traditional schooling often stifles creativity and curiosity. Holt wrote several influential books on education, including \"How Children Fail\" (1964), \"How Children Learn\" (1967), and \"Teach Your Own\" (1981). In these books, he argued that children are natural learners who are capable of teaching themselves if given the right environment and resources. Holt also founded the magazine \"Growing Without Schooling\" in 1977, which became a leading resource for homeschooling families. He was a vocal critic of the traditional education system and fought for education reform throughout his career. Today, Holt's ideas continue to influence the homeschooling and unschooling movements, and his work has been translated into many languages.",
