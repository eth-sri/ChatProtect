  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 provides a factual statement about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season, including the number of teams that participated and the winner of the championship.\n\nStatement 2 mentions that there is conflicting information about which team finished in last place that season, but it does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1. It simply notes that there is no official record of the team that finished in last place, which does not invalidate the information provided in Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they can both be considered valid and accurate."
