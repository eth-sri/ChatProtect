  "explanation": " The two statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Both statements correctly state that the semifinals were played in a best-of-five series format. This means that each semifinal series was played as a best-of-five format, where the team that wins three games first advances to the next round. Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other and do not contain any contradictions."
