  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 removes the information about EC Graz winning their first championship, which is not necessary to the main point of the sentence, but still provides the same information about the season.\n\nStatement 2 removes the detail about EC Graz defeating VEU Feldkirch in the finals, but it does not contradict the information provided in statement 1, as it only removes a specific detail and does not change the overall meaning of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and both can be used to provide information about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season."
