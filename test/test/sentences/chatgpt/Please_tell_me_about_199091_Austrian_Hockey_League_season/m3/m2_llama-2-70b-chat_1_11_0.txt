  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions Reinhard Divis as the top goaltender of the season, citing his goals against average (GAA) and save percentage (SV%) statistics. Statement 2 also mentions Reinhard Divis as the top goaltender of the season, but provides different statistics, specifically his SV% and GAA.\n\nIt is possible that Statement 1 and Statement 2 are referring to different sources or criteria for determining the top goaltender of the season. Alternatively, it is possible that there was a mistake in the reporting or recording of the statistics, leading to the discrepancy between the two statements.\n\nWithout further information or context, it is difficult to determine which statement is correct or if there is a mistake in one or both of the statements. However, it is important to note that both statements agree on the identity of the top goaltender of the season, Reinhard Divis, and only differ in the specific statistics they provide."
