  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain some conflicting information. Statement 1 mentions the teams EC KAC, EC VSV, EHC Lustenau, Wiener EV, and EC Salzburg as participating in the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season, while Statement 2 includes EC KAC, VEU Feldkirch, EC VSV, EC Kitzb\u00fchel, EC Graz, Wiener EV, EHC Lustenau, and EV Innsbruck as participating teams.\n\nThe conflicting information lies in the fact that Statement 1 does not mention VEU Feldkirch, EC Kitzb\u00fchel, EC Graz, and EV Innsbruck, while Statement 2 includes these teams. It is possible that these teams participated in the league, but it is also possible that there was a change in the lineup of teams between the two statements, or that one of the statements contains incorrect information.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to confirm whether the statements are contradictory without further information or clarification. It would be best to consult additional sources to verify the accuracy of the information provided in both statements."
