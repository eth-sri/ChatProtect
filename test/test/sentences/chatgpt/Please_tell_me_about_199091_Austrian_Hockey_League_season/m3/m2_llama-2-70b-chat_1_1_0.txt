  "explanation": " The two statements provided are not contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 revises the original sentence by removing the conflicting information, which is the mention of the league being the top level of ice hockey in Austria, while preserving the valid information, which is the season's number and the fact that it was the Austrian Hockey League season.\n\nStatement 2 also removes the same unnecessary detail, but it does so in a different way, by simply omitting it from the sentence.\n\nBoth statements provide accurate information and do not contradict each other."
