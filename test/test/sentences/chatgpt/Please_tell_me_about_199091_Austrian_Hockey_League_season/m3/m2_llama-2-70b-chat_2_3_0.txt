  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions the VEU Feldkirch finishing in first place with a record of 38 wins, 2 losses, and 6 ties, while Statement 2 states that each team played a total of 36 games. This does not create a contradiction as the number of games played by each team does not affect the standings or the championships won by the VEU Feldkirch. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
