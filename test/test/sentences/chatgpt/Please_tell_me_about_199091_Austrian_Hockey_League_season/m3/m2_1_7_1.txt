  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Klagenfurt AC defeated Wiener EV and EC VSV defeated EC KAC in the semifinals, while Statement 2 says that EC VSV defeated Wiener EV in the quarterfinals to advance to the semifinals. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide conflicting information about which teams advanced to the semifinals and how they got there."
