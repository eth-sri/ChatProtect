  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 is a revised sentence that removes conflicting information and preserves valid information about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season. It simply states that the season was the 61st season of the Austrian Hockey League, the top level of ice hockey in Austria, without mentioning any specific champion.\n\nStatement 2 mentions that there is conflicting information about the champion of the season, with two different teams listed as winners in different sources. This statement does not contradict Statement 1, as it only highlights the uncertainty surrounding the championship winner, without providing any incorrect or contradictory information.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both provide valid information about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season."
