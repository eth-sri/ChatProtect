  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 lists Klagenfurt AC and EK Zell am See as two of the teams, while Statement 2 lists EC KAC and EC Kitzb\u00fchel in their place. These are different teams, and therefore the statements cannot both be true."
