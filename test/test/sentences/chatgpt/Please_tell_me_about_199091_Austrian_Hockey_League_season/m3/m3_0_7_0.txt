  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Statement 2 provides more specific information about Markus Peintner's performance, stating that he was the top scorer of the regular season with 51 points. Statement 1 simply states that he was a top scorer of the season, which could still be true even if he was not the top scorer overall. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
