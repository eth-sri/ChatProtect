  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Markus Peintner was the top scorer of the season with 111 points, while Statement 2 claims that he was the top scorer of the regular season with 51 points. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that Peintner was the top scorer of the regular season with 51 points, but someone else surpassed him in the playoffs and became the top scorer of the entire season with 111 points. Without further information, it is impossible to determine which statement is accurate."
