  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain some conflicting information. Statement 1 mentions EC Salzburg as one of the teams that competed in the league, while Statement 2 does not include EC Salzburg and instead lists Innsbrucker EV as a team that competed. Additionally, Statement 2 includes VEU Feldkirch, which is not mentioned in Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the statements are contradictory, and it is not possible to determine which teams actually competed in the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season based on the information provided. Further research or clarification would be necessary to confirm the correct teams that participated in the league that season."
