  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the season began on September 28, 1990 and ended on March 17, 1991, while statement 2 states that the season began on September 21, 1990 and ended on March 3, 1991. The dates for the beginning and end of the season are different in each statement, so they cannot both be true."
