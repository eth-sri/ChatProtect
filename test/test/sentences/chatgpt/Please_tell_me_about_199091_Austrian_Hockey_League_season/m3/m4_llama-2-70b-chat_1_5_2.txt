  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain some conflicting information. Statement 1 mentions four teams that competed in the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season, while Statement 2 lists eight teams. The teams mentioned in Statement 1 are a subset of the teams listed in Statement 2.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is not contradictory to Statement 2, but rather, it provides a partial list of the teams that competed in the season. It is possible that the four teams mentioned in Statement 1 were the top four teams that advanced to the playoffs, while the other teams listed in Statement 2 did not make it to the playoffs.\n\nHowever, without further information, it is difficult to confirm this hypothesis. It is also possible that there was a mistake in one of the statements, or that there was a change in the lineup of teams during the season. To provide a more accurate answer, additional information would be needed."
