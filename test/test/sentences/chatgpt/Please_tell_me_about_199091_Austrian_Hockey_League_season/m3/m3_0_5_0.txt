  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. The text states that the top six teams from the regular season competed in the playoffs, while statement 1 suggests that only four teams were left in the playoffs, which would mean that two teams were eliminated before the playoffs began. Statement 2 clarifies that only four teams were left after the first round of the playoffs, which is not contradictory to the information provided in the text."
