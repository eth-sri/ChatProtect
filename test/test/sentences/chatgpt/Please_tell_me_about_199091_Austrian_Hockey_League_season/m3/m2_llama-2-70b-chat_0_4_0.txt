  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain conflicting information, and they can both be true.\n\nStatement 1 mentions the dates of the regular season, which implies that the season started on September 13, 1990, and ended on February 2, 1991.\n\nStatement 2 mentions that each team played 28 games during the regular season. This information does not contradict the dates provided in Statement 1, as the 28 games could have been played within the given timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they both provide valid information about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season."
