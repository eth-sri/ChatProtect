  "explanation": " The two statements provided about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the leading scorer of the season was Peter Raffl, who scored a total of 51 points, while Statement 2 states that the leading scorer of the season was Christian Perthaler of EC VSV, who also scored a total of 51 points. Both statements agree on the total number of points scored by the leading scorer, but they differ in naming the player who achieved this feat. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather provide complementary information."
