Their clients are often quirky or flawed, but the consultants always find a way to help them find love. The show stars Holly Robinson Peete as Denise, a former dating consultant who becomes the head of Love, Inc. after the previous boss retires. She is joined by Clea Lewis as Viviana, a former attorney who is new to the dating business, Reagan Gomez-Preston as Francine, an optimistic and romantic consultant, and Ion Overman as Clea, a bold and sassy consultant. Throughout the series, the consultants navigate their own romantic lives as well as those of their clients. The show received mixed reviews and struggled to find a consistent audience, leading to its cancellation after one season. Despite its short run, Love, Inc. was praised for its diverse cast and portrayal of complicated relationships.",
