  "prefix": "Love, Inc. is a sitcom television series that aired on the UPN network from September 2005 to May 2006. The show follows a group of dating consultants at a company called \"Love, Inc.\" who help their clients find their perfect matches. Their clients are often quirky or flawed, but the consultants always find a way to help them find love. The show stars Holly Robinson Peete as Denise, who becomes the head of Love, Inc. She is joined by Clea Lewis as Viviana, a former attorney who is new to the dating business, Reagan Gomez-Preston as Francine, an optimistic and romantic consultant, and Ion Overman as Clea, a bold and sassy consultant. Throughout the series, the consultants navigate their own romantic lives as well as those of their clients. The show received mixed reviews and struggled to find a consistent audience, leading to its cancellation after one season. Despite its short run, Love, Inc. was praised for its diverse cast and portrayal of complicated relationships.",
