The show follows a group of dating consultants at a company called \"Love, Inc.\" who help their clients find their perfect matches.

Sure, here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and fits well after the given description:\n\nThe show stars Holly Robinson Peete as Clea Lavoy, the owner of Love, Inc. Sure, here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and preserves as much valid information as possible:\n\nShe is joined by a cast of talented actors, including Reagan Gomez-Preston as Francine, an optimistic and romantic consultant, and Ion Overman as Clea, a bold and sassy consultant. This sentence fits well after the given description and only contains information from the original sentence. Throughout the series, the consultants navigate their own romantic lives as well as those of their clients. The show received mixed reviews and struggled to find a consistent audience, leading to its cancellation after one season.
