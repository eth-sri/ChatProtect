In 1969, he learned about the My Lai Massacre, in which American soldiers killed over 500 unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women, children, and elderly people. Determined to expose the truth, Ridenhour conducted his own investigation by interviewing fellow soldiers who had served in the area. He compiled a detailed report and sent it to the Defense Department, Congress, and the media. Thanks to Ridenhour's efforts, the My Lai Massacre became public knowledge and led to the prosecution of several soldiers involved. Ridenhour received the Army Commendation Medal for his actions.",
