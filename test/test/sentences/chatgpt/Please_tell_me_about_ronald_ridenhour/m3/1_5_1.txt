  "prefix": "Ronald Ridenhour (1946-1998) was an American soldier and journalist who played a significant role in exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. In 1969, Ridenhour was a helicopter door-gunner in the US Army and heard rumors about the massacre - the killing of hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers. After his service, he became a journalist and began to investigate further. He spent over a year collecting evidence and testimony from fellow soldiers and Vietnamese survivors before writing a letter to Congress detailing what had happened at My Lai. This letter, which was eventually published in major newspapers, helped to spark a national conversation about the war crimes committed by American soldiers.",
