He is best known for his role in uncovering the My Lai massacre, a mass killing of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by United States Army soldiers during the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Ridenhour heard about the massacre and was disturbed by what he had heard. He began to investigate the incident, collecting information from fellow veterans and conducting interviews with survivors and witnesses.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about his actions in uncovering the My Lai massacre. Both statements mention that Ridenhour compiled a detailed report on the massacre, but the first statement specifies that he sent it to members of Congress and the media, while the second statement adds that he also sent it to the Pentagon and the White House. These statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Ridenhour's efforts to expose the truth about the massacre."
