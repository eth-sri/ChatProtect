  "alt": "Were any soldiers involved in the massacre held accountable for their actions? Yes, several soldiers involved in the My Lai Massacre were eventually held accountable for their actions. Lieutenant William Calley, who led the platoon responsible for the killings, was court-martialed and found guilty of murder. He was sentenced to life in prison, but his sentence was later reduced to 20 years and he was eventually released on parole. Other soldiers were also court-martialed and convicted of crimes related to the massacre. However, many people felt that the punishments were not severe enough and that more soldiers should have been held accountable.",
  "prefix": "Ronald Ridenhour (1946-1998) was an American soldier and journalist who played a significant role in exposing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. In 1969, Ridenhour was a helicopter door-gunner in the US Army and heard rumors about the massacre - the killing of hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers. After his service, he became a journalist and began to investigate further. He spent over a year collecting evidence and testimony from fellow soldiers and Vietnamese survivors before writing a letter to Congress detailing what had happened at My Lai. This letter, which was eventually published in major newspapers, helped to spark a national conversation about the war crimes committed by American soldiers.",
