  "prefix": "Ronald Ridenhour was a Vietnam War veteran and a former helicopter door gunner who became a journalist after leaving the military. He is best known for his role in uncovering the My Lai massacre, a mass killing of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by United States Army soldiers during the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Ridenhour heard about the massacre and was disturbed by what he had heard. He began to investigate the incident, collecting information from fellow veterans and conducting interviews with survivors and witnesses. He compiled a detailed report about the massacre and sent it to members of Congress, the Pentagon, and the media. Ridenhour's efforts helped to expose the My Lai massacre to the public, resulting in a scandal that rocked the US military and government. His report led to investigations, court-martials, and the eventual conviction of several soldiers involved in the massacre. Ridenhour continued to work as a journalist and activist after the Vietnam War, focusing on issues related to government accountability and social justice. He died in 1998 at the age of 52.",
