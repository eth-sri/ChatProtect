Angola was a Portuguese colony until 1975, and Brazil played an important role in the decolonization process. Brazil recognized Angola's independence on November 11, 1975, and the two countries have had diplomatic relations ever since. In recent years, the relationship between Brazil and Angola has strengthened considerably, especially in the areas of trade and investment.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but rather the second statement builds upon the first by indicating that bilateral trade has been steadily increasing. Both statements highlight the strong trade relationship between the two countries, with the only difference being the specific amount of bilateral trade in 2019."
