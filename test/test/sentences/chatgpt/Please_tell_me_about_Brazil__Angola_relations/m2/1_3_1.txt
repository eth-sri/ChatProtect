In 2019, the trade between the two countries was around $2.3 billion, which is a significant decrease from the $5.2 billion in 2013. The main reason for this decline is the economic crisis in Angola, which has led to a decrease in demand for Brazilian products. Additionally, Brazilian companies have faced challenges in doing business in Angola due to bureaucratic hurdles and corruption. However, both countries have expressed a desire to strengthen their economic ties and increase trade and investment in the future.",
