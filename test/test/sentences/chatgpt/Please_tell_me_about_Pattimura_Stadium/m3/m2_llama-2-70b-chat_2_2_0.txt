  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 is a revised version of the original sentence, which removes the mention of Persiram Raja Ampat, a football club that may have been associated with the stadium. This revision is appropriate because it maintains the valid information about the stadium's location and purpose.\n\nStatement 2 is a request for clarification, asking for additional information to complete a sentence that is missing a crucial piece of information. This statement does not provide any new information about Pattimura Stadium, but rather seeks to obtain more context or details.\n\nTherefore, the two statements do not contain contradictory information, and they both contribute to a safe and respectful conversation about Pattimura Stadium."
