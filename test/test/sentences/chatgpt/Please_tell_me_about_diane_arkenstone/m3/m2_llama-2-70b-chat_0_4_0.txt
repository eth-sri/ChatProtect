  "explanation": " The two statements provided about Diane Arkenstone are contradictory.\n\nStatement 1 says that Diane Arkenstone released her first album, \"The Angels Voice,\" in 1992.\n\nStatement 2 says that she released her debut album \"The Angels Voice\" in 1990.\n\nThe contradiction lies in the fact that Statement 1 implies that \"The Angels Voice\" was not Diane Arkenstone's debut album, while Statement 2 states that it was her debut album.\n\nTherefore, to resolve this contradiction, we need to clarify which statement is accurate. If Statement 1 is accurate, then Statement 2 is incorrect, and \"The Angels Voice\" was not Diane Arkenstone's debut album. If Statement 2 is accurate, then Statement 1 is incorrect, and \"The Angels Voice\" was Diane Arkenstone's debut album, released in 1990."
