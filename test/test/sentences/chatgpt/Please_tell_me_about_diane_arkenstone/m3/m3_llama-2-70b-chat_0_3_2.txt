  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain conflicting information, and they can both be true.\n\nStatement 1 mentions the release of Diane Arkenstone's debut album, \"The Angels Voice,\" in 1990.\n\nStatement 2 states that Diane Arkenstone has released over 20 albums in the New Age and World music genres.\n\nThese statements do not contradict each other, as the first statement only mentions one specific album, while the second statement provides a broader overview of Diane Arkenstone's discography. It is possible for an artist to release multiple albums in different genres, and both statements can be accurate."
