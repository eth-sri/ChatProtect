  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 is a revised version of the original prompt, removing any conflicting information and preserving the valid information that Diane Arkenstone is an American musician, composer, and singer-songwriter.\n\nStatement 2 acknowledges that there isn't enough context to provide a sentence that fits the prompt and asks for additional information or a new prompt. This statement does not contradict the first statement, as it only expresses the limitation of providing a response without sufficient information.\n\nTherefore, the two statements are not contradictory, and they both aim to provide helpful and accurate information to the best of their abilities."
