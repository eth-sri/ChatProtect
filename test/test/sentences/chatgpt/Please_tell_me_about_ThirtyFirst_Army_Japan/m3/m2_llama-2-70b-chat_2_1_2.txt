  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 states that the Thirty-First Army was formed in September 1944, while Statement 2 states that it was formed on April 6, 1944. The difference in formation dates is significant, and it is not possible for the army to have been formed on both dates. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
