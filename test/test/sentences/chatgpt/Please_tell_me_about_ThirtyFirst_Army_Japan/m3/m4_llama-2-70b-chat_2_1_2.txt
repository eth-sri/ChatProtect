  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain any contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original sentence to remove any potentially conflicting information while still conveying the same meaning. Statement 2 provides additional information about the army's responsibilities, which does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
