  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original sentence, removing the mention of the Eighteenth Army, while still maintaining that the Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Statement 2 provides additional information about the composition of the Thirty-First Army, stating that it was made up of two divisions. This information does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
