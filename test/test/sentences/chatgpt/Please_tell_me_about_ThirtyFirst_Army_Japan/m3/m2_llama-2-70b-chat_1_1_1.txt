  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original sentence to clarify the composition of the Thirty-First Army, while Statement 2 mentions that the conflicting information preserves the exact number of soldiers who served in the Thirty-First Army. However, it is not clear what conflicting information is being referred to, as the original sentence did not provide any information about the number of soldiers in the Thirty-First Army. Therefore, Statement 2 does not provide any contradictory information to Statement 1."
