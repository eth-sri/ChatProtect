  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War. It was formed in September 1944 in the Philippines and was tasked with the defense of the Visayas region, a group of islands in the central Philippines. The army was also responsible for maintaining communication lines to the Japanese fleet and providing support to the naval forces in the area. The Thirty-First Army was under the command of Lt. General Suzuki S\u014dsaku and was composed of several divisions, including the 102nd Infantry Division, 103rd Infantry Division, and the 68th Independent Mixed Brigade. These forces were made up of a mix of veteran soldiers and poorly trained conscripts. At the time of its formation, the Thirty-First Army faced a difficult situation. American forces had already landed on several islands in the Philippines, and the army was short of supplies and reinforcements. Despite this, the army was able to mount a strong defense of the Visayas region, using a combination of fortifications, guerrilla tactics, and amphibious assaults.",
