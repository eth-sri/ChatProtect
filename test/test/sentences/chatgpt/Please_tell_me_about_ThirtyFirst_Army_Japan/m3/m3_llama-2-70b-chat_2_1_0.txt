The first statement mentions the Thirty-First Army's role in defending the Visayas region in the Philippines, while the second statement clarifies that the army was not involved in the Battle of Okinawa. These two statements do not contradict each other, as they provide different pieces of information about the Thirty-First Army's activities during World War II."
