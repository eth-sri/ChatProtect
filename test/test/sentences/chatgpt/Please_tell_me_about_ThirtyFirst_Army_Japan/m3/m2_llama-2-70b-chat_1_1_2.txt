  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 rephrases the original sentence, removing the mention of the Eighteenth Army, while still conveying that the Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Statement 2 provides additional information about the army's responsibilities, specifically its role in defending the northern front of Japan's mainland against the Soviet Union. The two statements complement each other and do not contain conflicting information."
