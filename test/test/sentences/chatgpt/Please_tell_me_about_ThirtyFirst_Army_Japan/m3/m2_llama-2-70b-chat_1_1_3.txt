  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 provides additional information about the composition of the Thirty-First Army, specifying that it was primarily composed of remnants from the disbanded Eighteenth Army. This information does not contradict the initial statement that the Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.\n\nStatement 2 provides general information about the composition of a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army, specifying that it was typically composed of infantry and artillery units. This information does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1, as the Thirty-First Army was indeed a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army, and it is reasonable to assume that it was composed of infantry and artillery units, as well as other supporting units.\n\nTherefore, the statements provided do not contain contradictory information, and they both contribute to a better understanding of the Thirty-First Army (Japan) during World War II."
