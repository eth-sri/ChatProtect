It was established on May 17, 1945, in the city of Nagoya and was responsible for the defense of the central region of Honshu Island, the largest island in Japan. The Thirty-First Army was commanded by General Shizuichi Tanaka, who was also the commanding officer of the 16th Area Army. The main objective of the Thirty-First Army was to defend the central region of Honshu Island against the expected Allied invasion. However, due to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent surrender of Japan, the Thirty-First Army did not see any combat action. After the surrender of Japan, the Thirty-First Army was dissolved, and its soldiers were demobilized. Many of the soldiers returned to their hometowns, while others were captured and detained by allied forces.",
