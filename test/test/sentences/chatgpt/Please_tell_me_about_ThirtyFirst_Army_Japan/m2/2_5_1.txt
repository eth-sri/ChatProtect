The difficult situation, including the lack of resources and poorly trained soldiers, likely had a negative impact on the operations of the Thirty-First Army. It may have made it more difficult for them to effectively defend the Visayas region and provide support to the Japanese fleet.",
  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War. It was formed in September 1944 in the Philippines and was tasked with the defense of the Visayas region, a group of islands in the central Philippines. The army was also responsible for maintaining communication lines to the Japanese fleet and providing support to the naval forces in the area. The Thirty-First Army was under the command of Lt. General Suzuki S\u014dsaku and was composed of several divisions, including the 102nd Infantry Division, 103rd Infantry Division, and the 68th Independent Mixed Brigade. These forces were made up of a mix of veteran soldiers and poorly trained conscripts.",
