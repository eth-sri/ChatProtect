  "alt": "The Thirty-First Army is believed to have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Filipino civilians during the war. In 2006, a memorial to the victims of the Bataan Death March (a forced march of Filipino and American prisoners of war by the Japanese) was erected in Capas, Tarlac, Philippines, near the site of a former Japanese prisoner of war camp.",
  "prefix": "The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was created on October 16, 1944, and was primarily composed of remnants from the disbanded Eighteenth Army. The Thirty-First Army was stationed in the Philippines, where it engaged in several battles with American and Filipino forces. The Thirty-First Army's mission was to defend the Philippines against the Allies, but by the time the army was established, the Allies had already regained control of most of the islands. The army was unable to push back the Allies and was forced to retreat to the mountains of the northern Philippines. In December 1944, the army suffered a devastating defeat in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which effectively ended the Japanese Navy's ability to conduct large-scale operations in the Pacific. The Thirty-First Army continued to resist the Allies in the mountains of northern Luzon until the end of the war in August 1945.",
