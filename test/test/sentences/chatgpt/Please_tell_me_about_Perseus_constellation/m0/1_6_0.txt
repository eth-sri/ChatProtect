  "orig": "Algol is actually a binary star system where two stars orbit around each other, blocking each other's light in a regular cycle, causing the star to appear to dim and brighten.",
  "alt": "Another interesting object in Perseus is the star Algol B, which is a subgiant star that orbits the bright star Algol every 2.87 days. This eclipsing binary system causes Algol to vary in brightness over a period of 2.87 days, making it one of the most famous variable stars in the night sky.",
  "prefix": "Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It was named after the mythological Greek hero Perseus, who was famous for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is located northwest of Cassiopeia, northeast of Andromeda, and east of Camelopardalis. Perseus contains many interesting deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye. Other notable objects include NGC 869 and NGC 884, two bright nebulae that are also part of the double cluster. One of the most famous objects in Perseus is the variable star Algol, which represents the eye of Medusa.",
