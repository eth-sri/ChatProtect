  "alt": "What happens in a stellar nursery? In a stellar nursery, clouds of gas and dust come together under the force of gravity to form new stars. As the cloud collapses, it heats up and begins to spin, eventually forming a protostar at its center. The protostar continues to grow as it accretes more material from the surrounding cloud, eventually becoming a fully-fledged star. During this process, the protostar may also emit jets of gas and dust, which can help to clear out the surrounding material and make it easier for other stars to form.",
  "prefix": "Perseus is a northern constellation located between Andromeda and Auriga. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is famous for beheading the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation was first documented by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus contains several notable objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known as the \"Demon Star\" due to its fluctuating brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster that is home to thousands of individual galaxies. One of the most intriguing objects in Perseus is the nebula known as NGC 1333.",
