  "orig": "Algol is actually a binary star system where two stars orbit around each other, blocking each other's light in a regular cycle, causing the star to appear to dim and brighten.",
  "alt": "What causes Algol to appear to dim and brighten? Algol appears to dim and brighten because it is a binary star system, consisting of two stars orbiting around each other. As one star passes in front of the other, it partially blocks the light from the other star, causing Algol to appear dimmer. This is known as an eclipsing binary system.",
  "prefix": "Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It was named after the mythological Greek hero Perseus, who was famous for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is located northwest of Cassiopeia, northeast of Andromeda, and east of Camelopardalis. Perseus contains many interesting deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye. Other notable objects include NGC 869 and NGC 884, two bright nebulae that are also part of the double cluster. One of the most famous objects in Perseus is the variable star Algol, which represents the eye of Medusa.",
