It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. The constellation is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive \"W\" shape, created by the bright stars Mirfak, Algol, Atik, and Menkib. Perseus is home to several interesting objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which appears to periodically dim in brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster located 240 million light-years from Earth.",
