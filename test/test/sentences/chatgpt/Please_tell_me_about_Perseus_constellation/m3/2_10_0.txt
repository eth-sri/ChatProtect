  "alt": "Perseus is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.",
  "prefix": "Perseus is a northern constellation located between Andromeda and Auriga. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is famous for beheading the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation was first documented by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD. Perseus contains several notable objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which is known as the \"Demon Star\" due to its fluctuating brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster that is home to thousands of individual galaxies. One of the most intriguing objects in Perseus is the nebula known as NGC 1333. This cloud of gas and dust is a stellar nursery, where new stars are being born. It is estimated that there are over 700 young stars in NGC 1333, all of which are less than a million years old. Perseus is also home to several other interesting stars, such as Mirfak, which is a bright white star that is much larger and hotter than the Sun. Another notable star in Perseus is Menkib, which is a blue supergiant that is over 30 times more massive than the Sun.",
