  "prefix": "Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the legendary Greek hero who slew the monster Medusa. It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. The constellation is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive \"W\" shape, created by the bright stars Mirfak, Algol, Atik, and Menkib. Perseus is home to several interesting objects, including the famous variable star Algol, which appears to periodically dim in brightness. It also contains the Perseus Cluster, a massive galaxy cluster located 240 million light-years from Earth. In Greek mythology, Perseus was known as the slayer of Medusa, a monster with snakes for hair who could turn men to stone. Perseus was able to defeat her with the help of Athena, who gave him a mirrored shield to avoid looking directly at her.",
