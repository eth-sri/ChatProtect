The constellation is located northwest of Cassiopeia, northeast of Andromeda, and east of Camelopardalis. Perseus contains many interesting deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, a pair of open star clusters that are visible to the naked eye. Other notable objects include NGC 869 and NGC 884, two bright nebulae that are also part of the double cluster. One of the most famous objects in Perseus is the variable star Algol, which represents the eye of Medusa.",
