He was known for his realistic and expressive sculptures, which often depicted historical and mythological figures. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is his sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Serpent,\" which was inspired by the story of Adam and Eve. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain as a serpent bites her on the leg. It caused controversy when it was first displayed in 1847 because of its sensual and erotic nature. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, which captured the likeness and character of his subjects. He created busts of famous figures such as the writer George Sand and the composer Hector Berlioz.",
