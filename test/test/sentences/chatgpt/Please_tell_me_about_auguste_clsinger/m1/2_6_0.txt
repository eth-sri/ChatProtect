He studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and became well known for his realistic and expressive sculptures. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is the sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman in agony as a snake bites her breast, and it caused controversy due to its erotic subject matter. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits and busts, including a portrait of his wife, the writer George Sand. He was a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts and was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1861.",
