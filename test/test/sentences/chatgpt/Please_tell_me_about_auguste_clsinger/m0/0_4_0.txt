He studied under the renowned sculptor James Pradier and became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1861. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" a marble sculpture depicting the biblical story of Eve being tempted by the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its erotic nature and Cl\u00e9singer's use of realistic details, such as the woman's exposed nipples.",
