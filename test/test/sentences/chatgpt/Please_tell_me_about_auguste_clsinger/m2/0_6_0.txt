  "prefix": "Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor known for his neoclassical and romantic works. He studied under the renowned sculptor James Pradier and became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1861. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" a marble sculpture depicting the biblical story of Eve being tempted by the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its erotic nature and Cl\u00e9singer's use of realistic details, such as the woman's exposed nipples. Cl\u00e9singer also created several portraits of notable figures, including French writer George Sand, with whom he had a romantic relationship. He also designed the tomb of Alexandre Dumas, which features a sculpture of the writer seated on a throne.",
