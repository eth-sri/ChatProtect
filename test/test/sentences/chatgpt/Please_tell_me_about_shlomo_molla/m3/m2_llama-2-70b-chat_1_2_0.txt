  "explanation": " The two statements provided about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that he immigrated to Israel with his family in 1984 as part of Operation Moses, which brought thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Statement 2 simply states that he immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia in 1984. Both statements agree that Shlomo Molla immigrated to Israel in 1984, with Statement 1 providing additional information about the specific operation that brought him and his family to Israel. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, and they can both be considered valid information about Shlomo Molla's background."
