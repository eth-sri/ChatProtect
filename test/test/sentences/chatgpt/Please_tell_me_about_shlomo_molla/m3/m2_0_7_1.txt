  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he is a member of the Meretz political party and is focused on promoting social justice and equality for all Israelis. The first statement also adds that the party is focused on promoting peace, while the second statement emphasizes that Molla's work is for all Israelis, not just a specific community. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Molla as a politician and social activist who is dedicated to promoting equality and justice in Israeli society."
