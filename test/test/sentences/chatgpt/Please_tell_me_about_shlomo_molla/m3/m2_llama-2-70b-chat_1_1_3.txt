  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain any contradictory information. The first statement states that Shlomo Molla served as a member of the Knesset for the Kadima party from 2008 to 2013, while the second statement adds that he also served as Deputy Speaker of the Knesset during his time in office. This additional information does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides more details about Molla's roles and responsibilities during his tenure in the Knesset. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
