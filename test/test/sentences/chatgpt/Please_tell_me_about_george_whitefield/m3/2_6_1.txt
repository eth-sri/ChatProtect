  "prefix": "George Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher who lived from 1714 to 1770. He is considered one of the most influential figures in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and began his career as a preacher in the Church of England. However, he became dissatisfied with the formalism and lack of spiritual vitality in the church, and began preaching in open-air meetings and other non-traditional venues. Whitefield's powerful preaching style and charismatic personality drew huge crowds, and he became one of the most popular preachers of his day. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and America, preaching to thousands of people at a time.",
