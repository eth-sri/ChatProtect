  "prefix": "George Whitefield was an English Anglican preacher who lived from 1714 to 1770. He is considered one of the most influential figures in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 18th century. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and began his career as a preacher in the Church of England. However, he became dissatisfied with the formalism and lack of spiritual vitality in the church, and began preaching in open-air meetings and other non-traditional venues. Whitefield's powerful preaching style and charismatic personality drew huge crowds, and he became one of the most popular preachers of his day.",
