  "prefix": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican preacher and evangelist who played a significant role in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. He was known for his powerful and emotional sermons, which drew large crowds and inspired many to convert to Christianity. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a minister in the Church of England and began preaching in London in the 1730s. In 1739, he traveled to the American colonies, where he conducted a series of highly successful preaching tours. Whitefield's preaching style was characterized by his ability to move his audience to tears and to inspire them to commit themselves to a life of Christian devotion. He preached in a simple, direct style that appealed to both the educated and the uneducated. He also used dramatic gestures and facial expressions to emphasize his points. Whitefield's preaching tours in the colonies helped to unite the various religious denominations and to create a sense of national identity among the colonists. He also helped to lay the foundation for the evangelical movement in America, which would become a major force in American religious and political life. Whitefield died in Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1770, at the age of 55.",
