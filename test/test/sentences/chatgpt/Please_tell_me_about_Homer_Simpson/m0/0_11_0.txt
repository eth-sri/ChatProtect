He is married to his high school sweetheart, Marge Simpson, and they have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

Despite his flaws, Homer's heart is in the right place and he loves his family deeply. He has a close relationship with his children, often giving them misguided but well-intentioned advice. Homer also has a deep respect for his boss, Mr. Burns, and is friendly with his neighbor Ned Flanders, despite their differing beliefs. Throughout the series, Homer has been involved in numerous comical misadventures, from accidentally poisoning his coworkers to saving Springfield from a catastrophic meltdown. His signature catchphrase is \"D'oh!\"",
