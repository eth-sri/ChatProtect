He is voiced by actor Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on the show's debut episode \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" on December 17, 1989. Homer is the bumbling and lazy husband of Marge and the father of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. He works as a nuclear safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and is best known for his catchphrases \"D'oh!\" and \"Mmm... donuts.\" Homer is often seen as a lovable but flawed character, with a short temper and a penchant for overeating, drinking, and slacking off at work.",
