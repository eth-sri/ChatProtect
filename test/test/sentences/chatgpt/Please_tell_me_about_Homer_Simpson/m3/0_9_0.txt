Homer was born in Springfield, USA and is a safety inspector at the local nuclear power plant. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Marge Simpson, and they have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Homer is known for his love of beer, donuts, and other junk food, and his laziness and lack of intelligence often get him into trouble. Despite his flaws, Homer's heart is in the right place and he loves his family deeply. He has a close relationship with his children, often giving them misguided but well-intentioned advice. Homer also has a deep respect for his boss, Mr. Burns, and is friendly with his neighbor Ned Flanders, despite their differing beliefs.",
