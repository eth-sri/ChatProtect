  "prefix": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a type of architecture that emerged in England in the 1860s and 1870s, as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution and the mass production of goods. It was a movement that sought to revive traditional craftsmanship, design, and materials in architecture. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by architects like William Morris, Philip Webb, and Charles Voysey, who emphasized simplicity, functionality, and craftsmanship in their designs. The movement had a profound influence on the development of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts. The key features of Arts and Crafts architecture include a focus on natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick, the use of traditional building techniques, including hand-carved details, and an emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style often incorporated elements of Gothic architecture, such as pointed arches and intricate tracery. Arts and Crafts architecture was also known for its emphasis on integrated design, which meant that the architecture, interior design, and decorative arts were all created by the same group of artists and craftsmen, creating a unified whole. Some of the best-known examples of English Arts and Crafts architecture include William Morris' Red House in Bexleyheath, Kent, Charles Voysey's The Homestead in Frinton, Essex, and C.F.A.",
