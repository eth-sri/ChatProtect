  "prefix": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in the late 19th century in England. It is characterized by an emphasis on traditional craftsmanship, the use of natural materials, and a focus on the decorative arts. This style of architecture is often associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, which was a broader social and cultural movement that sought to promote traditional craftsmanship and design. English Arts and Crafts architecture reflected this movement through its use of handcrafted elements such as brickwork, timber framing, and decorative tilework. The style was also influenced by a growing interest in medieval architecture and design, which is reflected in the use of pointed arches, steeply pitched roofs, and other Gothic-inspired details.",
