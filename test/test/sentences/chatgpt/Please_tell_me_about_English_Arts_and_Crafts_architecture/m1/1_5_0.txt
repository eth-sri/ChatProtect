  "prefix": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style that emerged in England in the late 19th century, influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement. It was a response to the industrialisation and mass-production of goods, with a focus on traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The architecture is characterised by its attention to detail, with decorative features such as exposed timber beams, decorative ironwork and stained glass windows. It favours asymmetrical designs with steeply pitched roofs, often featuring gables and dormer windows. The use of local materials was also important and many of the buildings feature brick, stone and timber.",
