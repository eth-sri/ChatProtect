  "orig": "Arts and Crafts architecture was also known for its emphasis on integrated design, which meant that the architecture, interior design, and decorative arts were all created by the same group of artists and craftsmen, creating a unified whole.",
  "alt": "What is integrated design in Arts and Crafts architecture? Integrated design in Arts and Crafts architecture refers to the idea that all aspects of a building's design, including its architecture, interior design, and decorative arts, should be unified and harmonious. This means that the design of a building's exterior should be reflected in its interior, and that the decorative elements should be integrated into the overall design rather than added as an afterthought. The goal of integrated design is to create a cohesive and unified aesthetic that reflects the values of the Arts and Crafts movement, including simplicity, functionality, and craftsmanship.",
  "prefix": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a type of architecture that emerged in England in the 1860s and 1870s, as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution and the mass production of goods. It was a movement that sought to revive traditional craftsmanship, design, and materials in architecture. The Arts and Crafts movement was led by architects like William Morris, Philip Webb, and Charles Voysey, who emphasized simplicity, functionality, and craftsmanship in their designs. The movement had a profound influence on the development of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts. The key features of Arts and Crafts architecture include a focus on natural materials such as stone, wood, and brick, the use of traditional building techniques, including hand-carved details, and an emphasis on symmetry and proportion. The style often incorporated elements of Gothic architecture, such as pointed arches and intricate tracery.",
