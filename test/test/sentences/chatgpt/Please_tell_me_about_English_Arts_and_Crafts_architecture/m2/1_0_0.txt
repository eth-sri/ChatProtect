  "alt": "What is English Arts and Crafts architecture? English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It is characterized by a focus on traditional craftsmanship, natural materials, and a rejection of mass-produced, machine-made goods. The style is often associated with the work of architect and designer William Morris, who championed the idea of creating beautiful, functional objects that were accessible to all. English Arts and Crafts architecture is known for its use of local materials, such as stone and timber, and its emphasis on handcrafted details, such as intricate woodwork and stained glass windows. The style was popular in England and the United States in the early 20th century, and its influence can still be seen in contemporary architecture and design.",
