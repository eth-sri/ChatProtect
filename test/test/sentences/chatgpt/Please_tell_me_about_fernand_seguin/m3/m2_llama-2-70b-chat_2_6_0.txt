  "explanation": " The two statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Seguin earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Montreal, with the first statement using the phrase \"Ph.D.\" and the second statement using the phrase \"PhD.\" The use of different abbreviations for the degree does not indicate a contradiction. Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other."
