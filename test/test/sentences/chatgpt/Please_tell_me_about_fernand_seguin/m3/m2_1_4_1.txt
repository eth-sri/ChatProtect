  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements mention his involvement in hosting a science radio program called \"Les ann\u00e9es lumi\u00e8re\" on Radio-Canada, with the only difference being the duration of the program. Statement 1 mentions that he hosted the program for over 20 years, while Statement 2 specifies that the program aired from 1966 to 1983, which is also over 20 years. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about Fernand Seguin's career as a science communicator."
