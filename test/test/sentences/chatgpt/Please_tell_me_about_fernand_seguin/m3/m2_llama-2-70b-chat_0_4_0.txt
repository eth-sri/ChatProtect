Sure, here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and preserves as much valid information as possible:\n\nFernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian scientist, broadcaster, and environmentalist.

  "explanation": " The two statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that he earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1948, while Statement 2 states that he completed his PhD in biochemistry at the same university in 1947. It is possible that he completed his PhD in 1947 and then officially received his degree in 1948. Therefore, both statements can be true, and they do not contradict each other."
