Statement 1 simply states that Fernand Seguin studied at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, while statement 2 provides more specific information about what he studied at the same university, which was biochemistry. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Fernand Seguin was a Canadian scientist and broadcaster."
