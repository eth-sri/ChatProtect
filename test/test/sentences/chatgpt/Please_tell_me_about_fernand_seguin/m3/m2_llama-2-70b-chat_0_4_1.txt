Sure, here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and preserves as much valid information as possible:\n\nFernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian scientist, broadcaster, and environmentalist.

  "explanation": " The two statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Statement 1 states that he earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1948, while Statement 2 states that he earned a PhD in physiology from the same university in 1948. It is possible for someone to earn multiple doctoral degrees, and it is not uncommon for scientists to have degrees in multiple fields related to their area of expertise. Therefore, both statements can be true, and they do not contradict each other."
