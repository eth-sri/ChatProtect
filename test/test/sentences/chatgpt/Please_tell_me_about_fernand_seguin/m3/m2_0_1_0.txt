  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he earned a degree in biochemistry, while the second statement mentions that he earned a PhD in nuclear physics. These are two different fields of study, and it is unlikely that someone would earn a degree in one and a PhD in the other. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
