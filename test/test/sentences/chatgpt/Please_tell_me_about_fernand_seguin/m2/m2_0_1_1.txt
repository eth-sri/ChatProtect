  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he earned a degree in biochemistry from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, while the second statement claims that he earned a medical degree from the same university. These two degrees are different and cannot both be true, so the statements contradict each other."
