  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. The first statement claims that he was appointed as Minister of Trade in November 2020, while the second statement claims that he was appointed as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey in November 2020. These are two different positions, and he cannot hold both at the same time. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
