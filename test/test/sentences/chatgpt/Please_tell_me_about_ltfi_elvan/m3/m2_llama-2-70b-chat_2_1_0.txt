  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 states that L\u00fctfi Elvan has been serving in the Turkish government since November 2020, while Statement 2 states that he removed the position of Minister of Development in Turkey. This implies that he can't be serving in the government if he removed a position. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
