  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain some contradictory information.\n\nStatement 1 mentions that L\u00fctfi Elvan has been serving in the Turkish government since November 2020, but it does not specify which ministry he is serving in.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, specifically states that L\u00fctfi Elvan is currently serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey.\n\nTherefore, the statements are contradictory because Statement 1 does not confirm that L\u00fctfi Elvan is serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance, while Statement 2 explicitly states that he is.\n\nTo reconcile the contradiction, it would be necessary to clarify which ministry L\u00fctfi Elvan is currently serving in, or to provide additional information that would explain how he can be serving in both the Turkish government and as the Minister of Treasury and Finance simultaneously."
