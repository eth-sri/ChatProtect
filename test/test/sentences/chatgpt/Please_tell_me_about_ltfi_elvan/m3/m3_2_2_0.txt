  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. The text states that he studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, but statement 2 claims that he obtained his Master's degree in civil engineering from the University of Birmingham in the UK. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about his educational background."
