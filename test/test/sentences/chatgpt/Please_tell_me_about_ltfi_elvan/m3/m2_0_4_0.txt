  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan obtaining a Ph.D. in economics are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that he obtained his Ph.D. in 1991, while statement 2 claims that he obtained it from the University of London in 1993. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the same event. Therefore, they are contradictory."
