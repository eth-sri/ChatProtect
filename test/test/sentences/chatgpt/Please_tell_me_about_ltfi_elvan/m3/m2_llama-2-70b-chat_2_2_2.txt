  "explanation": " The two statements provided do not contain contradictory information. Statement 1 mentions that L\u00fctfi Elvan has been serving in the Turkish government since November 2020, without specifying which ministry he has been serving in. Statement 2 provides additional information that as of November 2020, L\u00fctfi Elvan has been serving as the Minister of Treasury and Finance. This information does not contradict Statement 1, as it provides more specific details about L\u00fctfi Elvan's role in the government. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
