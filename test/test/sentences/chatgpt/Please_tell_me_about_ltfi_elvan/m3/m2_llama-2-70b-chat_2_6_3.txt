  "prefix": " Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a revised sentence that removes the conflicting information and preserves as much valid information as possible:\n\nL\u00fctfi Elvan is a Turkish politician who has been serving in the Turkish government since November 2020. This sentence still provides information about L\u00fctfi Elvan being a Turkish politician and serving in the government, while removing the conflicting information about the specific ministry he has been serving in. He previously held various positions in the government, including Minister of Development, Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Budget Commission. Elvan was born in Nazilli, Ayd\u0131n in 1962 and studied Civil Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara.

  "explanation": " The two statements provided contain conflicting information. Statement 1 states that L\u00fctfi Elvan has been serving as the Minister of Trade of Turkey since November 2020, while Statement 2 states that he held the position of Minister of Development in the Turkish government from 2013 to 2015. These two statements cannot both be true, as they describe different positions that Elvan held at different times. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
