  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. The first statement describes him as a fighter ace, which implies that he was a skilled pilot who shot down enemy planes during aerial combat. The second statement, on the other hand, describes him as a field marshal, which is a high-ranking military officer responsible for commanding troops on the ground. It is unlikely that one person could hold both positions simultaneously, as they require different skill sets and responsibilities. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
