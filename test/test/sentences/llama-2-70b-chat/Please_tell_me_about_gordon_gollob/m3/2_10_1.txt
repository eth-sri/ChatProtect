Gollob saw action in World War I and remained in the army after the war, rising through the ranks to become a general during World War II.

He was known for his tactical ability and leadership, and was awarded several high honors for his service, including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Gollob was also known for his controversial personality and was often at odds with his superiors and colleagues. He was critical of Hitler's leadership and was once arrested and relieved of his command for insubordination. Despite this, he continued to serve in the army and was later reinstated. After the war, Gollob was imprisoned by the Allies and later released. He died on May 8, 1972, in Munich, Germany.",
