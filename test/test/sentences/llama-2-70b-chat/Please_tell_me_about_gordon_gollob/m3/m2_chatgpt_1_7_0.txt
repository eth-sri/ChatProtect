  "prefix": " Gordon Gollob was a German field marshal during World War II. Gollob saw service in World War I and remained in the army after the war, rising through the ranks to become a general during World War II. Gollob served as the commander of the German Sixth Army during World War II. Under his leadership, the Sixth Army played a key role in the initial German successes in the battle, but ultimately the army became trapped in the city and suffered heavy casualties. Gollob was criticized for his leadership during the battle and was eventually relieved of his command. After the battle, Gollob was placed in command of several other armies, but his reputation was tarnished and he was not considered for high-level command positions. He died on April 18, 1945, in a plane crash in Austria.",
