  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. The first statement describes him as a fighter ace, indicating that he was primarily involved in aerial combat. The second statement, on the other hand, describes him as a field marshal, which is a high-ranking position in the army and suggests that he was involved in ground operations. It is unlikely that one person could hold both positions simultaneously, making the statements contradictory."
