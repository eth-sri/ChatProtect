Gollob served in several fighter units during the war, including Jagdgeschwader 54 (Fighter Wing 54), and quickly established himself as a skilled and deadly pilot. He was known for his exceptional marksmanship and tactical abilities, earning the nickname \"M Gustav\" among his fellow pilots. Gollob claims the first Allied aircraft shot down over German soil on September 1, 1939. During the Battle of Britain, he flew Messerschmitt Bf 109s, downing 14 British aircraft.",
