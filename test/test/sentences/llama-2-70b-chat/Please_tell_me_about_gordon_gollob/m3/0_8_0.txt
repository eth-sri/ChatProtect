  "prefix": "  Gordon Gollob was a German fighter ace during World War II. He was born on June 16, 1912, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, and joined the German Luftwaffe in 1935. Gollob served in several fighter units during the war, including Jagdgeschwader 54 (Fighter Wing 54), and quickly established himself as a skilled and deadly pilot. He was known for his exceptional marksmanship and tactical abilities, earning the nickname \"M Gustav\" among his fellow pilots. Gollob claims the first Allied aircraft shot down over German soil on September 1, 1939. During the Battle of Britain, he flew Messerschmitt Bf 109s, downing 14 British aircraft. He continued to score victories throughout the war, becoming one of the top-scoring aces of all time. On January 29, 1944, Gollob was appointed commander of Jagdgeschwader 54, a position he held until the end of the war.",
