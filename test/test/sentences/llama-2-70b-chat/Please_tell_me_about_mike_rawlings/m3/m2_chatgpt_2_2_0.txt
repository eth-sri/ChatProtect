Statement 1 simply states that Rawlings was re-elected in 2015, while Statement 2 provides additional information about the election, including the fact that he defeated challenger Carolyn King Arnold in the general election. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Rawlings served as the Mayor of Dallas from 2011 to 2019."
