  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that he graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, while Statement 2 suggests that he only graduated from high school in 1973. These two statements cannot both be true, as graduating from a university requires completing a higher level of education beyond high school."
