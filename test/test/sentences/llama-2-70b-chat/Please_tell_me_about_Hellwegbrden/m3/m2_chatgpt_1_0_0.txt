  "explanation": "The statements about Hellwegb\u00f6rden are not contradictory. Both statements describe Hellwegb\u00f6rden as a type of German bread from the region of Westphalia. Statement 1 provides additional information about the traditional nature of the bread, while statement 2 simply identifies it as a type of bread. Therefore, the statements are complementary rather than contradictory."
