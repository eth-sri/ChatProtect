It is a famous quote from the celebrated Bengali poet and philosopher, Rabindranath Tagore, and is often used to describe a deep sense of longing or yearning. The phrase is often used in a philosophical context to describe the search for meaning and connection in life. It implies that true fulfillment and happiness can only be found when we are able to connect with something greater than ourselves, and that this connection is not limited to material possessions or worldly desires. The phrase has been used in various contexts, including literature, music, and film. In Bengali literature, it is often used to describe the longing for a lost love or a sense of disconnection from society. In music, it has been used in songs that express feelings of longing and melancholy.",
