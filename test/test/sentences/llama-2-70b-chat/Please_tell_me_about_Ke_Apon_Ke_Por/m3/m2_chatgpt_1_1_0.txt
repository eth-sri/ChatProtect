  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. The first statement mentions two sisters, Keka and Kutumb, while the second statement focuses on a young girl named Joba. These are two different storylines and cannot both be the main focus of the show. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
