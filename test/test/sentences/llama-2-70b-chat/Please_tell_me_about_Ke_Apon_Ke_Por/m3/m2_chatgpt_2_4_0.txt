  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. While the phrase is often used in a philosophical context to describe the search for meaning and connection in life, both statements suggest that true happiness can be found through a connection with something greater than oneself or through deep connections with others and the world around us. Both statements emphasize the importance of connection and suggest that it is a key component of finding happiness and meaning in life."
