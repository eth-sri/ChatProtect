  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Ke Apon Ke Por as a popular Bengali television soap opera, while Statement 2 describes it as a popular Bangladeshi television drama series. While Bengali is the official language of Bangladesh, it is also spoken in the Indian state of West Bengal. Therefore, it is possible for a television show to be both Bengali and Bangladeshi. However, the use of different terms to describe the show (soap opera vs. drama series) suggests that the two statements may be referring to different versions or adaptations of Ke Apon Ke Por. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the contradiction."
