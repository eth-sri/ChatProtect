  "explanation": "The statements about Mick Garris are contradictory because statement 1 mentions \"The Fly II\" and \"Desperation\" as notable films he has directed, while statement 2 mentions \"The Stand\" and \"The Shining\" mini-series as films he has directed. These are different films, and therefore the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
