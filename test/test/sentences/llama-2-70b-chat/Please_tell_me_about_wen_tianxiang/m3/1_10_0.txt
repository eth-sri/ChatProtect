  "prefix": "  Wen Tianxiang (\u6587\u5929\u7965, 1236-1283), also known as Wen Hui-hsiang, was a Chinese military leader and politician who lived during the Song Dynasty. He was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province) and became a prominent figure in the imperial court during the reign of Emperor Duzong. Wen Tianxiang was known for his military prowess and his efforts to defend the Song Dynasty against the invading Mongol Empire. He played a crucial role in the Battle of Xiangyang, a long and bloody conflict between the Song Dynasty and the Mongols that lasted from 1268 to 1273. Wen Tianxiang's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His family was of modest means, and he was forced to work as a laborer to support himself. Despite these challenges, Wen Tianxiang was able to pursue his education and eventually passed the imperial examinations, becoming a scholar-official in the government. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning recognition for his intelligence and leadership abilities. Wen Tianxiang's military career began in 1258, when he was appointed as a commander of the imperial army. He distinguished himself in several battles against the Mongols, who had been invading Song territory for several decades.",
