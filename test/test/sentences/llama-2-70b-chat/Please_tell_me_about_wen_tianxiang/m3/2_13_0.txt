  "prefix": "  Wen Tianxiang (\u6587\u5929\u7965, 1235-1285) was a Chinese poet and scholar who lived during the Song Dynasty. He was also known as Wen Ziming, and his courtesy name was Tianxiang. Wen was born in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, and was known for his literary talent from an early age. He was a master of the classical Chinese poem, or \"jueju,\" and was considered one of the four great poets of his time, along with Lu You, Du Fu, and Bai Juyi. Wen Tianxiang's poetry was known for its clarity and elegance, and he often wrote about nature, morality, and politics. He was particularly known for his use of imagery and metaphor, and was praised by contemporaries for his ability to evoke powerful emotions with simple language. Many of his poems express longing for his hometown and family, as well as his sadness and frustration with the political upheaval of his time. In addition to his poetry, Wen Tianxiang was also a renowned scholar and historian. He was particularly interested in the study of the Classics, and his commentaries on Confucian texts were highly influential. He also wrote a number of essays on history, politics, and morality, and was known for his strong sense of social justice. Wen Tianxiang's life was marked by personal and political turmoil. He passed the imperial exams and held several official positions, but was often at odds with the ruling authorities and was eventually exiled. He spent much of his later life traveling and writing, and died in 1285.",
