  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Wen Tianxiang are contradictory. Statement 1 describes him as a poet and scholar, while statement 2 describes him as a poet and statesman. The difference between scholar and statesman is significant, as a scholar is typically focused on academic pursuits while a statesman is involved in political affairs. Therefore, the two statements present different aspects of Wen Tianxiang's life and career."
