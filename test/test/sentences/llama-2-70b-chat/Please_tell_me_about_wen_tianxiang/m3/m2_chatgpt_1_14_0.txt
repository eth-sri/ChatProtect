  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (\u6587\u5929\u7965, 1236-1283) was a Chinese poet and statesman who lived during the Song Dynasty. Wen Tianxiang was known for his military prowess and his efforts to defend the Song Dynasty against the invading Mongol Empire. He played a crucial role in the Battle of Xiangyang, a long and bloody conflict between the Song Dynasty and the Mongols that lasted from 1268 to 1273. Wen Tianxiang's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His family was of modest means, and he was forced to work as a laborer to support himself. Despite these challenges, Wen Tianxiang was able to pursue his education and eventually passed the imperial examinations, becoming a scholar-official in the government. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning recognition for his intelligence and leadership abilities. Wen Tianxiang was appointed as a commander of the imperial army. He distinguished himself in several battles against the Mongols, who had been invading Song territory for several decades. Wen Tianxiang's successes on the battlefield earned him the respect of his peers and the fear of his enemies. He was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Song army in 1268, just as the Mongols were preparing to launch a massive invasion of the Song Dynasty. The Battle of Xiangyang was one of the most significant conflicts of Wen Tianxiang's career. The Mongols, led by Kublai Khan, had besieged the city of Xiangyang for several years, and the Song army was struggling to hold them back. Wen Tianxiang was tasked with relieving the city and driving the Mongols back.",
