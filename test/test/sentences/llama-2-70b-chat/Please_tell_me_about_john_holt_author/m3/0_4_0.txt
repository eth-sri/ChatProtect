  "prefix": "  John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author, educator, and philosopher who was best known for his work in the field of alternative education. He was a prominent critic of traditional schooling and advocated for a more personalized and self-directed approach to learning. Holt's most influential book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964 and challenged the conventional wisdom of the time by arguing that the traditional school system was not effective in helping children learn. He believed that children were naturally curious and eager to learn, but that the rigid structure and conformity of school often stifled their natural curiosity and creativity.",
