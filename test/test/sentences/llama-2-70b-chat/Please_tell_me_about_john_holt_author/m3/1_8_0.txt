  "prefix": "  John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author, educator, and philosopher who is best known for his work in the fields of alternative education and children's rights. He was a prominent critic of traditional schooling and advocated for a more child-centered approach to learning. Holt was born in New York City and attended the University of Colorado, where he earned a degree in physics. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later worked as a high school physics teacher. However, he became disillusioned with the traditional education system and its emphasis on rote learning and standardized testing. In the 1960s, Holt began to explore alternative forms of education, including homeschooling and democratic schools. He argued that children are naturally curious and motivated to learn, and that they should be allowed to pursue their interests and learn at their own pace. He also believed that children should have a say in their own education and that they should be treated with respect and dignity.",
