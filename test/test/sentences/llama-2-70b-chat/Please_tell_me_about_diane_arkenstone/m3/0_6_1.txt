Arkenstone's music is characterized by its dreamy, ethereal quality and often features nature-inspired themes. She has released numerous albums, including \"The Secret Garden,\" \"The Healing Journey,\" and \"The Essential Diane Arkenstone,\" which feature her signature blend of ambient soundscapes, keyboard textures, and soothing melodies.
