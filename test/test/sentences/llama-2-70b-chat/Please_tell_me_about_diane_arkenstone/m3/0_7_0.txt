Born in 1957 in Chicago, Illinois, Arkenstone began her music career in the 1970s as a folk singer, performing in coffeehouses and clubs in the Midwest. She later transitioned to playing keyboard instruments and synthesizers, and her music evolved into a blend of electronic and acoustic sounds. Arkenstone's music is characterized by its dreamy, ethereal quality and often features nature-inspired themes. She has released numerous albums, including \"The Secret Garden,\" \"The Healing Journey,\" and \"The Essential Diane Arkenstone,\" which feature her signature blend of ambient soundscapes, keyboard textures, and soothing melodies. In addition to her music, Arkenstone is also known for her work in sound healing and has developed a method called \"Soul Medicine\" that uses sound and vibration to promote relaxation, balance, and well-being. She has also collaborated with other artists, including Lindsey Stirling and t\u00f6r\u03af, and has contributed music to various films and television shows.",
