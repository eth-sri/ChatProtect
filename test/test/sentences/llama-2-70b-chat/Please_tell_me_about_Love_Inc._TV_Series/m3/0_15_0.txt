  "prefix": "  Love, Inc. is an American television sitcom that aired from 2005 to 2006. It was created by \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435bounds Pictures in association with Touchstone Television and ambient ionic love, Inc. The show revolves around the dating experiences of a group of friends living in New York City. The show follows the lives of six friends, all in their 20s, who share an apartment building in Manhattan. The main characters are:\n\n* Frances \"Fran\" Drescher as Frannie Morgan, a successful businesswoman who runs her own dating service, Love, Inc., and is the central character of the show. * Paul (Josh Hopkins), a lawyer and Fran's on-again, off-again boyfriend. * Scott (Donnie Keshawarz), a woodworker and Fran's confidant. * Emily (Busy Philipps), a receptionist at Love, Inc. and Fran's best friend. * Arthur (Eden Sher), Fran's eccentric and geeky assistant. * and Parker (Christian Borle), a womanizing, narcissistic bartender who often gets into trouble. The show's main premise revolves around Fran's attempts to find love for her clients while also navigating her own dating life. Each episode features a new match for one of Fran's clients, often with comedic and sometimes disastrous results. Throughout the series, Fran also struggles with her own relationships, particularly her on-again, off-again romance with Paul. Despite its promising premise and talented cast, Love, Inc. struggled to find an audience and was ultimately canceled after one season. The show's poor ratings were likely due to its poor time-slot, weak marketing, and competition from other popular shows at the time.",
