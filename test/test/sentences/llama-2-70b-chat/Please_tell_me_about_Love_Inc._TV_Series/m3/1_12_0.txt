  "prefix": "  Love, Inc. is an American television sitcom that aired from 2005 to 2006. The show was created by Andrew Reich and Ted Cohen, and it starred French Stewart, Christine Lakin, and Jessica Lu. The series revolves around the life of Clea (played by Christine Lakin), a cynical and pragmatic wedding planner who runs her own company, Love, Inc. Clea's business provides her with a sense of stability and control, but her personal life is a different story. She has a serial dater for a mother and a neurosurgeon father who is on his third marriage. Clea's best friend and business partner is a fiery, impulsive woman named Denise (played by Jessica Lu). The show's premise centers around Clea and Denise's misadventures in their personal and professional lives. They frequently find themselves in absurd situations, often caused by their own poor decision-making. Clea's search for love and her struggles with commitment are a recurring theme throughout the series. Love, Inc. features a number of romantic interests for Clea, including her business rival, Luke (played by French Stewart), and a charming, albeit dim-witted, man named Lance (played by Jordan Bually). The show also features a supporting cast of characters, including Clea's eccentric mother, Lara (played by Anne Meara), and her goofy, yet lovable, assistant, Weddy (played by Robin Thomas). Despite its light-hearted tone, Love, Inc. tackles a number of serious themes, such as the complexities of relationships, the importance of family, and the challenges of finding true love. The show's humor is often campy and physical, with a focus on slapstick comedy and witty banter.",
