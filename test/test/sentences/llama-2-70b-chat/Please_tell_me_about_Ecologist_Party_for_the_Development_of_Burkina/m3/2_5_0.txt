The party's main objective is to promote environmental protection and sustainable development in Burkina Faso. The party's roots can be traced back to the 1990s, when a group of environmental activists and civil society organizations began advocating for the creation of a political party that would focus on environmental issues. In 2011, the party was officially registered and has since been actively participating in the country's political scene. The PEDB's main goals include promoting sustainable agriculture, protecting natural resources, and addressing climate change.",
