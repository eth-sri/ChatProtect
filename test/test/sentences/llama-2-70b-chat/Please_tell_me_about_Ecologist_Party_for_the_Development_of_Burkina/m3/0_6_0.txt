The party's main objective is to promote environmental protection and sustainable development in the country. The PEDB was established in response to the growing concern about environmental degradation and the need for sustainable development in Burkina Faso. The party's founders believe that the traditional political parties in the country have failed to address these issues effectively, and that a new approach is needed. The party's platform focuses on several key areas, including:\n\n1. Environmental protection: The PEDB aims to promote policies that protect Burkina Faso's natural resources, such as forests, water, and soil.",
