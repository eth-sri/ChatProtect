  "prefix": "  The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (Parti \u00c9cologiste pour le D\u00e9veloppement du Burkina, PEDB) is a political party in Burkina Faso that was founded in 2011. The party's main objective is to promote environmental protection and sustainable development in Burkina Faso. The party's roots can be traced back to the 1990s, when a group of environmental activists and civil society organizations began advocating for the creation of a political party that would focus on environmental issues. In 2011, the party was officially registered and has since been actively participating in the country's political scene. The PEDB's main goals include promoting sustainable agriculture, protecting natural resources, and addressing climate change. The party also focuses on issues such as education, health, and gender equality, recognizing the interconnectedness of these issues with environmental sustainability. The party has contested several elections, including the 2012 general elections, in which it fielded candidates for the presidency, national assembly, and local government positions.",
