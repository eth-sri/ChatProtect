The party was founded in 1994 and is led by Dr. Alassane D. Ou\u00e9draogo. The PEDB is a left-wing political party that focuses on environmental issues and sustainable development. The party's main objective is to promote the preservation of the environment, natural resources, and cultural heritage of Burkina Faso. They aim to achieve this by advocating for policies and practices that support sustainable development, social justice, and economic growth. The party has several key areas of focus, including environmental protection, agriculture, energy, and education. They propose policies that promote the use of renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture practices, and the protection of natural habitats. They also advocate for increased investment in education, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that all citizens have access to quality education and the opportunity to participate in the country's economic development. The PEDB also places a strong emphasis on community involvement and participatory democracy. They believe that local communities should be actively involved in decision-making processes related to environmental and development issues. To achieve this, the party promotes the creation of local development committees and community-based organizations that can represent the interests of local communities.",
