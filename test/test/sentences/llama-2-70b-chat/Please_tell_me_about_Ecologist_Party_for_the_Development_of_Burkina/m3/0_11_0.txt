  "prefix": "  The Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina (Parti \u00c9cologiste pour le D\u00e9veloppement du Burkina, PEDB) is a political party in Burkina Faso that was founded in 2011. The party's main objective is to promote environmental protection and sustainable development in the country. The PEDB was established in response to the growing concern about environmental degradation and the need for sustainable development in Burkina Faso. The party's founders believe that the traditional political parties in the country have failed to address these issues effectively, and that a new approach is needed. The party's platform focuses on several key areas, including:\n\n1. Environmental protection: The PEDB aims to promote policies that protect Burkina Faso's natural resources, such as forests, water, and soil. The party advocates for sustainable agriculture practices, renewable energy sources, and the conservation of natural habitats. 2. Sustainable development: The party aims to promote sustainable development in Burkina Faso, with a focus on creating jobs and improving living standards while protecting the environment. The PEDB supports initiatives that promote economic growth while protecting the environment, such as ecotourism and sustainable agriculture. 3.",
