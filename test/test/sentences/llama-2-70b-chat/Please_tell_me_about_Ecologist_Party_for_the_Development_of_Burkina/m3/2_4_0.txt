The party's main objective is to promote environmental protection and sustainable development in Burkina Faso. The party's roots can be traced back to the 1990s, when a group of environmental activists and civil society organizations began advocating for the creation of a political party that would focus on environmental issues. In 2011, the party was officially registered and has since been actively participating in the country's political scene.",
