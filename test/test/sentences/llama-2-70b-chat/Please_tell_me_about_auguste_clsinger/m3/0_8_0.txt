  "prefix": "  Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1888) was a French sculptor and artist who was known for his work in the Romantic and Realist styles. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and began his artistic career as a painter, but eventually turned to sculpture, which became his primary medium. Cl\u00e9singer's early work was heavily influenced by the Romantic movement, and he often depicted dramatic and emotional scenes, often drawn from literature and mythology. One of his most famous works from this period is \"La Femme Damn\u00e9e,\" a sculpture depicting a woman writhing in agony, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1847. In the 1850s, Cl\u00e9singer's style began to shift towards Realism, and he became known for his detailed and accurate depictions of the human form. He was particularly interested in depicting the bodies of women, and his works often featured sensual, provocative female figures. One of his most famous works from this period is \"La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re,\" a sculpture of a young woman with a suggestive smile and a plunging neckline. Cl\u00e9singer's work was widely admired and respected during his lifetime, and he was awarded numerous awards and honors, including the Legion of Honor.",
