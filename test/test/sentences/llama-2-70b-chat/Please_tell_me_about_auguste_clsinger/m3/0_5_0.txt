He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and began his artistic career as a painter, but eventually turned to sculpture, which became his primary medium. Cl\u00e9singer's early work was heavily influenced by the Romantic movement, and he often depicted dramatic and emotional scenes, often drawn from literature and mythology. One of his most famous works from this period is \"La Femme Damn\u00e9e,\" a sculpture depicting a woman writhing in agony, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1847. In the 1850s, Cl\u00e9singer's style began to shift towards Realism, and he became known for his detailed and accurate depictions of the human form.",
