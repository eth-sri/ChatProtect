  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both provide information about Cl\u00e9singer being awarded the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art prize, in 1840, which allowed him to study at the Villa Medici in Rome. The only difference is that statement 2 provides more specific information about the year in which he received the award."
