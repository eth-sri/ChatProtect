  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Cl\u00e9singer studied under Jules H programma, while Statement 2 suggests that he studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about Cl\u00e9singer's education."
