He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France and began his artistic career as a painter, but eventually turned to sculpture, which became his primary medium. Cl\u00e9singer's early work was heavily influenced by the Romantic movement, and he often depicted dramatic and emotional scenes, often drawn from literature and mythology. One of his most famous works from this period is \"La Femme Damn\u00e9e,\" a sculpture depicting a woman writhing in agony, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1847.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements highlight different aspects of Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style and focus. The first statement emphasizes his skill in accurately portraying the human form, while the second statement highlights his ability to convey emotional intensity in his work. These two aspects can complement each other in his sculptures, as he was able to capture both the physical and emotional aspects of his subjects."
