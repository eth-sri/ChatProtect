  "prefix": " \nAuguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was active during the Romantic era. He is best known for his marble sculptures, which often depicted nude figures, mythological creatures, and allegorical scenes. Cl\u00e9singer was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and began his artistic training at a young age. He studied under the tutelage of several prominent sculptors, including Fran\u00e7ois Rude and Jean-Baptiste Isabey. In 1840, he won the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art scholarship that allowed him to study at the Villa Medici in Rome. During his time in Rome, Cl\u00e9singer was heavily influenced by the works of Italian Renaissance masters, such as Michelangelo and Bernini. He also became friends with other French artists living in Rome, including the painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. Cl\u00e9singer's sculptures are characterized by their dramatic poses, intricate details, and sensual forms. Many of his works depict nude figures, often in the throes of passion or ecstasy. His most famous sculpture, \"La Danse\" (1850), features a group of nude women dancing in a circle, their bodies entwined in a sinuous, rhythmic pose. In addition to his sculptures, Cl\u00e9singer also created a number of portraits and funerary monuments. He was particularly known for his ability to capture the likeness of his subjects, and his portraits were highly sought after by the French aristocracy. Cl\u00e9singer's work had a significant impact on the development of 19th-century French sculpture. His use of dramatic poses and sensual forms helped to define the Romantic aesthetic, and his influence can be seen in the work of later sculptors, such as Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet. Despite his success during his lifetime, Cl\u00e9singer's work fell out of favor in the early 20th century, and many of his sculptures were destroyed or lost.",
