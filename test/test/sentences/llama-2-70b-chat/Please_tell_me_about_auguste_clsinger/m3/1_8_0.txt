  "prefix": " \nAuguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was active during the Romantic era. He is best known for his marble sculptures, which often depicted nude figures, mythological creatures, and allegorical scenes. Cl\u00e9singer was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and began his artistic training at a young age. He studied under the tutelage of several prominent sculptors, including Fran\u00e7ois Rude and Jean-Baptiste Isabey. In 1840, he won the Prix de Rome, a prestigious art scholarship that allowed him to study at the Villa Medici in Rome. During his time in Rome, Cl\u00e9singer was heavily influenced by the works of Italian Renaissance masters, such as Michelangelo and Bernini. He also became friends with other French artists living in Rome, including the painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. Cl\u00e9singer's sculptures are characterized by their dramatic poses, intricate details, and sensual forms.",
