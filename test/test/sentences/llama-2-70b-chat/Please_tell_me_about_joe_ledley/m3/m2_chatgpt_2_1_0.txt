  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Joe Ledley are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Ledley joined Celtic in 2010 after starting his career with Cardiff City, while statement 2 says that he began his professional career with Cardiff City in 2008. If statement 2 is true, then Ledley could not have joined Celtic in 2010 without first playing for Cardiff City for at least two years. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
