  "prefix": "  Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a French-Canadian biochemist and science communicator. He is best known for his work on the metabolism of amino acids and his contributions to the field of biochemistry. Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and received his education at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and the University of Cambridge. He began his research career at the University of Montreal and later joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. Seguin's research focused on the metabolism of amino acids, particularly the breakdown of glutamate, which is an important neurotransmitter in the brain. He discovered several enzymes involved in this process, including glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate-1-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. In addition to his research, Seguin was a dedicated science communicator. He wrote several books on biochemistry and science, including \"Biochemistry: An Introduction\" and \"The Chemistry of Life.\" He also produced a number of educational films and television programs, including the award-winningseries \"The World of Chemistry.\"",
