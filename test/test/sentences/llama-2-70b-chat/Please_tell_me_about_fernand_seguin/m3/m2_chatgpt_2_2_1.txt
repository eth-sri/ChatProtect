  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that he worked at the National Research Council in Ottawa for over 30 years, while statement 2 mentions that he became a professor of biochemistry at the University of Montreal in 1957. These statements do not contradict each other as it is possible for someone to work at one institution for a long period of time and also hold a position at another institution during that time."
