  "prefix": "  Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a French-Canadian biochemist and science communicator. He is best known for his work on the metabolism of amino acids and his contributions to the development of Madison's Square Garden, a popular science museum in Montreal. Seguin was also a widely recognized science communicator, and he hosted several radio and television shows on science topics. He was known for his ability to explain complex scientific concepts in simple terms, making him a popular figure in Quebec and beyond. Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied at the University of Montreal, where he earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in biochemistry. He later pursued postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. In 1956, he returned to Montreal and joined the faculty of the University of Montreal, where he became a professor of biochemistry and metabolism. Seguin's research focused on the metabolism of amino acids, particularly the ways in which the human body uses and processes these essential building blocks of proteins. He made significant contributions to our understanding of the role of amino acids in various physiological processes, including the synthesis of proteins, the production of energy, and the detoxification of harmful substances. In addition to his research, Seguin was a passionate advocate for science education and communication.",
