He is best known for his work on the metabolism of amino acids and his contributions to the field of biochemistry. Seguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and received his education at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and the University of Cambridge. He began his research career at the University of Montreal and later joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.
