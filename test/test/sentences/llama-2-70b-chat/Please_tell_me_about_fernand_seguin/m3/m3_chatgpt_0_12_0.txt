  "prefix": " Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a French-Canadian biochemist. He is best known for his work on the metabolism of amino acids and his contributions to the development of Madison's Square Garden, a popular science museum in Montreal. Seguin was also a widely recognized science communicator, and he hosted several radio and television shows on science topics. He was known for his ability to explain complex scientific concepts in simple terms, making him a popular figure in Quebec and beyond. Seguin earned his PhD in biochemistry from the University of Montreal in 1946. He later pursued postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. In 1956, he returned to Montreal and joined the faculty of the University of Montreal, where he became a professor of biochemistry and metabolism. Seguin's research focused on the metabolism of amino acids, particularly the ways in which the human body uses and processes these essential building blocks of proteins. He made significant contributions to our understanding of the role of amino acids in various physiological processes, including the synthesis of proteins, the production of energy, and the detoxification of harmful substances. In addition to his research, Seguin was a passionate advocate for science education and communication. He believed that science should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level. He hosted a weekly radio show called \"Le scientifiqueish\" which explored various scientific topics in an engaging and accessible way.",
