  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his interest and contributions to the field of nitrogen metabolism, specifically in the role of microorganisms in nitrogen fixation. The first statement emphasizes how his work led to the development of new crops and agricultural practices, while the second statement emphasizes how his work led to a better understanding of the importance of nitrogen fixation for plant growth and crop yields. Both statements complement each other and provide different perspectives on Seguin's contributions to the field."
