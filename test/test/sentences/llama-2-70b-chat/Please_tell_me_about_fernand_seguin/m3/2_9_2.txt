  "prefix": "  Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a French-Canadian biochemist and microbiologist who made significant contributions to the fields of nutrition, metabolism, and agriculture. Seguin was born in Poitiers, France, and studied at the University of Bordeaux, where he received his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1947. He then moved to Canada and joined the National Research Council in Ottawa, where he worked for over 30 years. Seguin's research focused on the metabolism of nutrients in plants and animals, and he made major discoveries in the field of nitrogen metabolism. He was particularly interested in the role of microorganisms in nitrogen fixation, and his work led to the development of new crops and agricultural practices that improved crop yields and reduced the use of synthetic fertilizers. Seguin was also a pioneer in the field of gay science, and his work on the metabolism of amino acids helped to explain the role of nutrition in the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals. He was a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and visibility, and his work helped to promote understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals in the scientific community and beyond. Seguin received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the National Order of Quebec and the Order of Canada. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
