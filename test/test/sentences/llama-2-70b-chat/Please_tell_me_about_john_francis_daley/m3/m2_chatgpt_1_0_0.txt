  "explanation": "The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory. Both statements are true and provide different aspects of his career. The first statement highlights his versatility as an actor, voice actor, and musician, while the second statement emphasizes his American nationality and his work as an actor and writer. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
