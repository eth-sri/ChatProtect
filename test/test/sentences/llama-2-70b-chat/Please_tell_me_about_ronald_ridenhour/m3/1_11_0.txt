  "prefix": "  Ron Ridenhour was a former U.S. Army officer and whistleblower who rose to fame in the 1970s for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a notorious war crime committed by U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War. Ridenhour was born on April 6, 1946, in Denver, Colorado. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1966 and served as an infantryman in Vietnam. In March 1968, he witnessed the My Lai Massacre, in which U.S. soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai. Ridenhour was not directly involved in the massacre, but he was deeply troubled by what he saw and heard. After returning to the United States, Ridenhour began to speak out about the atrocities he had witnessed. He wrote letters to his congressman, senators, and the Pentagon, detailing the events of My Lai and criticizing the U.S. military's handling of the war. He also gave interviews to newspapers and magazines, and appeared on television programs, including the CBS News program \"60 Minutes.\" Ridenhour's revelations sparked widespread outrage and helped turn public opinion against the Vietnam War. He was hailed as a hero by anti-war activists and was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor, in 1972. However, he also faced criticism and condemnation from some quarters, and he received death threats from those who saw him as a traitor.",
