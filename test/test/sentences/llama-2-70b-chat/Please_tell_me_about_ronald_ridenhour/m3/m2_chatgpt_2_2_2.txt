  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he received the Bronze Star for his service, while the second statement claims that he was decorated with the Medal of Honor, which is a higher award. It is not possible for someone to receive both the Bronze Star and the Medal of Honor, as the latter is reserved for exceptional acts of valor and bravery. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
