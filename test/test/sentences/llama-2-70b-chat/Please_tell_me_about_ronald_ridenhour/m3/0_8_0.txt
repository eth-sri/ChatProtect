  "prefix": "  Ron Ridenhour was a former US Army soldier who became a prominent anti-war activist and whistleblower during the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a mass killing of hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by US soldiers in 1968. Ridenhour was born in 1946 in Louisiana and enlisted in the Army in 1966. He was deployed to Vietnam in 1968 and served as a door gunner on a helicopter. In March of that year, he witnessed the My Lai Massacre, in which US soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women and children, in the village of My Lai. Ridenhour was deeply troubled by what he saw and heard, and he began to speak out against the atrocities he had witnessed. Ridenhour wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, and several members of Congress, detailing the events at My Lai and criticizing the US military's conduct in Vietnam. He also gave interviews to reporters and spoke at anti-war rallies.",
