  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ron Ridenhour are contradictory. The first statement says that he enlisted in the Army in 1966, while the second statement says that he enlisted in the US Army in 1967. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different years for when Ridenhour enlisted in the Army."
