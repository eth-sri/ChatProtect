  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-1991 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that an Austrian team won the All-Star Game, while Statement 2 indicates that VEU Feldkirch, a specific Austrian team, won the championship title. However, the text does not provide information about which team won the All-Star Game, so it is possible that Statement 1 is true, but it does not necessarily contradict Statement 2."
