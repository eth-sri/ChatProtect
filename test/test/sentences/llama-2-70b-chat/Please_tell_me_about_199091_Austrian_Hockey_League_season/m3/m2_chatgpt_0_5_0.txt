  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-1991 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the winning team, EC KAC, finished the season with 35 wins, 10 losses, and 7 ties, while statement 2 says they finished with 35 wins, 10 losses, and 5 ties. The difference of two ties may seem small, but it still contradicts the information provided. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
