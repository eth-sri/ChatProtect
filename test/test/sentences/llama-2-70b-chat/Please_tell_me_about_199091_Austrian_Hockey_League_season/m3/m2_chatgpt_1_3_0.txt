  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that VEU Feldkirch won the championship by defeating EC KAC in the finals, while Statement 2 says that they won by defeating EC Graz in the final series. These are two different teams, and therefore cannot both be true."
