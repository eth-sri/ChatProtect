  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-1991 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides the general timeframe for the season, indicating that it began in September 1990 and ended in March 1991. Statement 2 provides the specific date on which the season ended, which is consistent with the general timeframe provided in Statement 1. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the duration of the season."
