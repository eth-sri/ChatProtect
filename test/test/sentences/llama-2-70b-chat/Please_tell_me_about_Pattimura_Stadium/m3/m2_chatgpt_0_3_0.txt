  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 20,000, while statement 2 claims that the seating capacity is approximately 15,000. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the same aspect of the stadium. Therefore, they are contradictory."
