  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 20,000 spectators, while statement 2 claims that the seating capacity is 15,000 spectators. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different numbers for the same attribute of the stadium."
