  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the stadium has a seating capacity of 15,000 spectators, while statement 2 says that the stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 20,000 people. The two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different numbers for the stadium's seating capacity."
