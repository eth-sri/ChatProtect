  "prefix": "  The Thirty-First Army (Japan) was a military formation of the Imperial Japanese Army that existed during World War II. It was formed in 1941 and was primarily involved in the Japanese invasion and occupation of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaya, Singapore, and the Philippines. The Thirty-First Army was initially composed of three divisions: the 5th, 18th, and 25th Divisions, along with several supporting units. The army was commanded by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who was known for his leadership and tactical skills. The Thirty-First Army played a significant role in the early victories of the Japanese military in Southeast Asia. They successfully captured Malaya and Singapore in 1942, and later participated in the Battle of Bataan in the Philippines. However, the army's fortunes began to decline when they faced fierce resistance from Allied forces in the Philippines and Indonesia. In 1944, the Thirty-First Army was badly defeated in the Battle of Leyte, and their forces were subsequently pushed back to the northern Philippines.",
