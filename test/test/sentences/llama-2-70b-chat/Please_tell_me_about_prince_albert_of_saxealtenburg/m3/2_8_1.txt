He was born in Altenburg, the capital of Saxe-Altenburg, and was the eldest son of Duke Ernest I and his first wife, Princess Marie of Hildburghausen. Prince Albert was educated at home and later studied law and politics at the University of Jena. He succeeded his father as duke in 1853, but due to his minority, a regency council ruled in his place until he came of age. In 1863, he was officially recognized as an adult and began ruling in his own right. During his reign, Prince Albert focused on modernizing the duchy and improving the lives of his subjects. He promoted the construction of railways, the expansion of agriculture and industry, and the development of education and healthcare. He also took an interest in art and culture, and was a patron of several artists and musicians.",
