  "prefix": "  Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1843-1902) was a German prince and the last reigning duke of Saxe-Altenburg, a duchy within the German Empire. He was born on April 24, 1843, in Koburg, Germany. Prince Albert succeeded his father as duke in 1853, upon Eduard's death. At the time, Saxe-Altenburg was a relatively small duchy, with a population of around 200,000 people. During his reign, Prince Albert focused on modernizing the duchy's infrastructure and economy. He invested heavily in industry, particularly in the textile and mining sectors, and established a railway network to connect Saxe-Altenburg with other parts of Germany. Prince Albert was also known for his cultural interests and patronage. He supported the arts and sciences, and founded several institutions, including the Altenburg Academy of Sciences and the Altenburg Theater. He also commissioned the construction of several notable buildings, such as the Altenburg Palace and the Church of St. Mary. In 1871, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia. The couple had three children together, one son named Duke Ernst II. After the death of his father-in-law, Prince Charles, in 1883, Prince Albert became involved in a succession dispute over the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory as they provide different dates and locations of his death. Statement 1 states that he died on July 22, 1902, while statement 2 states that he died on July 29, 1902, in Schwarzburg, Germany. These two statements cannot both be true, and therefore, they are contradictory."
