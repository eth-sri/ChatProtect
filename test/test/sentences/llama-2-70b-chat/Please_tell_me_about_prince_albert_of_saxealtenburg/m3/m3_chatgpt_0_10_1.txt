He was born on April 24, 1843, in Koburg, Germany. Prince Albert succeeded his father as duke in 1853, upon Eduard's death. At the time, Saxe-Altenburg was a relatively small duchy, with a population of around 200,000 people. During his reign, Prince Albert focused on modernizing the duchy's infrastructure and economy. He invested heavily in industry, particularly in the textile and mining sectors, and established a railway network to connect Saxe-Altenburg with other parts of Germany. Prince Albert was also known for his cultural interests and patronage. He supported the arts and sciences, and founded several institutions, including the Altenburg Academy of Sciences and the Altenburg Theater. He also commissioned the construction of several notable buildings, such as the Altenburg Palace and the Church of St. Mary. In 1871, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory as they mention different names for his son. Statement 1 says that the couple had one son named Duke Ernst II, while statement 2 says that they had one son named Prince Frederick. It is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
