  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Prince Albert became the reigning duke of Saxe-Altenburg, while Statement 2 suggests that he became the reigning prince of Saxe-Altenburg. However, since the two statements use different titles, it is possible that they are referring to different periods in Prince Albert's life or different titles that he held. Further information would be needed to determine the accuracy and consistency of the statements."
