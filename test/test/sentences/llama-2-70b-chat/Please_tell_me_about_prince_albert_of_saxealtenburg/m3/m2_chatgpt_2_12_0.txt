  "prefix": "  Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1843-1902) was a German prince and the last reigning duke of Saxe-Altenburg, a small duchy located in the eastern part of Germany. He was born in Altenburg, the capital of Saxe-Altenburg, and was the eldest son of Duke Ernest I and his first wife, Princess Marie of Hildburghausen. Prince Albert studied law and politics at the University of Jena. He succeeded his father as duke in 1853, but due to his minority, a regency council ruled in his place until he came of age. In 1863, he was officially recognized as an adult and began ruling in his own right. During his reign, Prince Albert focused on modernizing the duchy and improving the lives of his subjects. He promoted the construction of railways, the expansion of agriculture and industry, and the development of education and healthcare. He also took an interest in art and culture, and was a patron of several artists and musicians. However, his troops were defeated, and Saxe-Altenburg was subsequently annexed by Prussia. Despite his exile, Prince Albert continued to be involved in politics and was a prominent figure in European society. He was known for his support for the Austrian monarchy. He also maintained good relations with the German Emperor, Wilhelm II.",
