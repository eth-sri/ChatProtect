  "prefix": "  Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1843-1902) was a German prince and the last reigning duke of Saxe-Altenburg, a small duchy located in the eastern part of Germany. He was born in Altenburg, the capital of Saxe-Altenburg, and was the eldest son of Duke Ernest I and his first wife, Princess Marie of Hildburghausen. Prince Albert was educated at home and later studied law and politics at the University of Jena. He succeeded his father as duke in 1853, but due to his minority, a regency council ruled in his place until he came of age. In 1863, he was officially recognized as an adult and began ruling in his own right.",
