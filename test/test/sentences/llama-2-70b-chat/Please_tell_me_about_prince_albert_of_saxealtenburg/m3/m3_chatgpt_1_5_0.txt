  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. The first statement says that Prince Albert succeeded his father as the reigning prince of Saxe-Altenburg, while the second statement says that he succeeded his father as the reigning duke of Saxe-Altenburg. The terms \"prince\" and \"duke\" have different meanings and refer to different levels of nobility. A prince is typically higher in rank than a duke, so it is not possible for someone to be both a prince and a duke at the same time. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
