  "prefix": "  Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg (1843-1902) was a German prince and the last reigning duke of Saxe-Altenburg, a duchy within the German Empire. He was born in Altenburg, Germany, as the eldest son of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg and his first wife, Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Prince Albert succeeded his father as duke in 1853, upon Eduard's death. At the time, Saxe-Altenburg was a relatively small duchy, with a population of around 200,000 people. During his reign, Prince Albert focused on modernizing the duchy's infrastructure and economy. He invested heavily in industry, particularly in the textile and mining sectors, and established a railway network to connect Saxe-Altenburg with other parts of Germany. Prince Albert was also known for his cultural interests and patronage. He supported the arts and sciences, and founded several institutions, including the Altenburg Academy of Sciences and the Altenburg Theater. He also commissioned the construction of several notable buildings, such as the Altenburg Palace and the Church of St. Mary. In 1871, Prince Albert married Princess Marie of Prussia, a daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia and a great-niece of King Frederick William III of Prussia. The couple had three children together, but only one son, Duke Ernst II, survived to adulthood. After the death of his father-in-law, Prince Charles, in 1883, Prince Albert became involved in a succession dispute over the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The dispute was eventually settled in 1893, when Prince Albert renounced his claim to the duchy in favor of his cousin, Duke Alfred of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Prince Albert died on July 22, 1902, in Berlin, Germany, at the age of 58. He was succeeded by his son, Duke Ernst II, who went on to rule Saxe-Altenburg until the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.",
