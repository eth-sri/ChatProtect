  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style of building design that emerged in the late 19th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, industrialized building methods and ornate Victorian styles that were prevalent at the time. The Arts and Crafts movement, as it was known, sought to promote a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. Architects and designers associated with the movement emphasized the importance of functionality, simplicity, and honesty of design. They believed that buildings should be designed with consideration for their context, purpose, and the people who would use them.",
