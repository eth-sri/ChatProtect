  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by a reaction against the ornate and overly ornamental architecture of the Victorian era. The movement, which emerged in the 1880s, sought to promote a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The style is characterized by the use of rough-hewn stone, brick, and timber, often left unfinished or roughly textured to emphasize its natural quality. Buildings often feature steeply pitched roofs, tall chimneys, and asymmetrical facades with a mix of windows, gables, and dormers.",
