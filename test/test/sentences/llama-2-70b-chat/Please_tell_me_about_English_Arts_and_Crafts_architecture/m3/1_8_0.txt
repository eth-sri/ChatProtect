  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by a reaction against the ornate and overly ornamental architecture of the Victorian era. The movement, which emerged in the 1880s, sought to promote a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The style is characterized by the use of rough-hewn stone, brick, and timber, often left unfinished or roughly textured to emphasize its natural quality. Buildings often feature steeply pitched roofs, tall chimneys, and asymmetrical facades with a mix of windows, gables, and dormers. Decorative elements, such as carvings, sculptures, and metalwork, are often intricately crafted and feature organic motifs, such as flowers, leaves, and vines. The interiors of Arts and Crafts buildings often feature large fireplaces, exposed beams, and built-in furniture, such as settles and benches. The use of natural materials and emphasis on handcrafted elements continued inside, with decorative elements like embroidered fabrics, carved wood, and hand-painted tiles. The English Arts and Crafts movement was influenced by the ideas of architects such as William Morris and John Ruskin, who believed that buildings should be designed to promote a sense of harmony between people and their environment.",
