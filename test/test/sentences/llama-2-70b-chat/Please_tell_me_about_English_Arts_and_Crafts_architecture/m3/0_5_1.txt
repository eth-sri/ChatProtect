  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style of building design that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in England. It was characterized by a reaction against the ornate and overly elaborated styles of the Victorian era, and sought to promote a return to simplicity, honesty of materials, and traditional craftsmanship. The movement was influenced by the ideas of William Morris and John Ruskin, who advocated for a return to the medieval principles of architecture, where buildings were designed to be functional, beautiful, and truthful to their materials. The style often featured exposed brick or stone walls, wide windows, and open floor plans. English Arts and Crafts architecture was often used for domestic buildings, such as houses and cottages, but it was also used for public buildings, including schools, museums, and churches.",
