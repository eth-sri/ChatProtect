  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by a reaction against the ornate and overly ornamental architecture of the Victorian era. The movement, which emerged in the 1880s, sought to promote a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The style is characterized by the use of rough-hewn stone, brick, and timber, often left unfinished or roughly textured to emphasize its natural quality. Buildings often feature steeply pitched roofs, tall chimneys, and asymmetrical facades with a mix of windows, gables, and dormers. Decorative elements, such as carvings, sculptures, and metalwork, are often intricately crafted and feature organic motifs, such as flowers, leaves, and vines. The interiors of Arts and Crafts buildings often feature large fireplaces, exposed beams, and built-in furniture, such as settles and benches. The use of natural materials and emphasis on handcrafted elements continued inside, with decorative elements like embroidered fabrics, carved wood, and hand-painted tiles. The English Arts and Crafts movement was influenced by the ideas of architects such as William Morris and John Ruskin, who believed that buildings should be designed to promote a sense of harmony between people and their environment. The style was popularized through the work of architects such as Philip Webb and William Lethaby, and it had a lasting influence on domestic architecture in England and beyond. Examples of notable Arts and Crafts buildings include the Red House, designed by Webb for Morris in 1859, and theavailable. The style also had a significant influence on the development of the Prairie School in the United States, which shared many of the same principles and aesthetics. Overall, English Arts and Crafts architecture was a reaction against the mass-produced, heavily ornamented architecture of the Victorian era, seeking to promote a return to traditional craftsmanship and natural materials.",
