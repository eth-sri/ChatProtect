  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style of building design that emerged in the late 19th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, industrialized building methods and ornate Victorian styles that were prevalent at the time. The Arts and Crafts movement, as it was known, sought to promote a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. Architects and designers associated with the movement emphasized the importance of functionality, simplicity, and honesty of design.",
