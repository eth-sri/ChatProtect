  "prefix": "  English Arts and Crafts architecture was a popular style of building design that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in England. It was characterized by a reaction against the ornate and overly elaborated styles of the Victorian era, and sought to promote a return to simplicity, honesty of materials, and traditional craftsmanship. The movement was influenced by the ideas of William Morris and John Ruskin, who advocated for a return to the medieval principles of architecture, where buildings were designed to be functional, beautiful, and truthful to their materials.",
