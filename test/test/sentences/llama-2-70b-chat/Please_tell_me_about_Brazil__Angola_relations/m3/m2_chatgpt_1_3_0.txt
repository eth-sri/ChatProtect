  "alt": " Brazil's relations with Angola cooled in the 1980s, due to Angola's growing alignment with the Soviet Union and Cuban-backed Marxist government.",
  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have had a complex and dynamic relationship since the 1960s, with ties that extend beyond the realm of diplomacy to encompass economic, cultural, and political cooperation. In the early 1960s, Brazil supported Angola's fight for independence from Portugal, providing military training and financial assistance to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). After Angola gained independence in 1975, Brazil established diplomatic relations with the country and provided significant economic aid, with a focus on infrastructure development and trade.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight a period of cooling in the relationship between the two countries, but for different reasons. The first statement cites disagreements over the civil war in Angola as the cause, while the second statement points to Angola's alignment with the Soviet Union and Marxist government. These factors likely contributed to the overall complexity and dynamic nature of the relationship between Brazil and Angola."
