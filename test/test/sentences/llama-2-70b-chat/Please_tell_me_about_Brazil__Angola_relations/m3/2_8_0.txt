  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have had diplomatic relations since 1975, shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal. The two countries have maintained a positive relationship, with Brazil being one of Angola's largest trading partners and investors. In recent years, Brazil has been Angola's main source of foreign investment, with Brazilian companies investing in sectors such as oil, mining, agriculture, and infrastructure. In 2017, Brazil's President Michel Temer visited Angola and signed several agreements to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Cultural exchange between Brazil and Angola has also been an important aspect of their relationship. Brazil has a large African diaspora community, with many Angolans residing in the country. There are also several cultural exchange programs and initiatives between the two countries, such as the Brazil-Angola Cultural Center, which aims to promote Angolan culture in Brazil. In addition, Brazil has provided significant aid to Angola, particularly in the areas of health and education.",
