  "orig": "In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil's relations with Angola cooled due to disagreements over the civil war raging in Angola.",
  "alt": " Brazil's relations with Angola have been strained at times, particularly during the Angolan Civil War, which raged from 1975 to 2002.",
  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have had a complex and dynamic relationship since the 1960s, with ties that extend beyond the realm of diplomacy to encompass economic, cultural, and political cooperation. In the early 1960s, Brazil supported Angola's fight for independence from Portugal, providing military training and financial assistance to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). After Angola gained independence in 1975, Brazil established diplomatic relations with the country and provided significant economic aid, with a focus on infrastructure development and trade.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. While the first statement acknowledges that there were disagreements between the two countries during the civil war in Angola, it does not suggest that the relationship was completely severed. The second statement further elaborates on the strain caused by the civil war, which lasted for almost three decades. Both statements provide different perspectives on the complex and dynamic nature of the relationship between Brazil and Angola."
