  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. Brazil, which had supported Angola's independence movement, was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's sovereignty. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil provided significant economic and military aid to Angola, which helped the country recover from the damage caused by the civil war that followed independence. Brazil also played a key role in the peace negotiations that led to the signing of the Bicesse Accords in 1991, which helped to end the conflict. Since then, Brazil and Angola have maintained strong economic and political ties. Brazil is one of Angola's largest trading partners, with significant investments in the areas of oil, mining, agriculture, and infrastructure. In 2018, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited Angola, where he signed several cooperation agreements in areas such as trade, security, and education. Cultural exchanges between the two countries have also been significant, with many Angolans studying in Brazil and a growing number of Brazilians visiting Angola for business and tourism.",
