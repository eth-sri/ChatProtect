  "orig": "In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil's relations with Angola cooled due to disagreements over the civil war raging in Angola, which pitted the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) against the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the FNLA.",
  "alt": " Brazil's economic ties with Angola continued to flourish, with bilateral trade agreements and investments in natural resources, such as oil and minerals, becoming a major focus of the relationship.",
  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have had a complex and dynamic relationship since the 1960s, with ties that extend beyond the realm of diplomacy to encompass economic, cultural, and political cooperation. In the early 1960s, Brazil supported Angola's fight for independence from Portugal, providing military training and financial assistance to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). After Angola gained independence in 1975, Brazil established diplomatic relations with the country and provided significant economic aid, with a focus on infrastructure development and trade.",
