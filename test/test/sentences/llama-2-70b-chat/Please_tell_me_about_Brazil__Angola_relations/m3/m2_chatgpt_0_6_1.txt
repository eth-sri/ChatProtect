  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. Brazil, which had supported Angola's independence movement, was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's sovereignty. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil provided significant economic and military aid to Angola, which helped the country recover from the damage caused by the civil war that followed independence. Brazil also played a key role in the peace negotiations that led to the signing of the Bicesse Accords in 1991, which helped to end the conflict. Since then, Brazil and Angola have maintained strong economic and political ties. Brazil has significant investments in the areas of oil, mining, agriculture, and infrastructure in Angola.",

Both statements highlight the signing of cooperation agreements between the two countries, one during a visit by the Brazilian President to Angola and the other during a visit by the Angolan President to Brazil. These agreements demonstrate the continued strong economic and political ties between Brazil and Angola."
