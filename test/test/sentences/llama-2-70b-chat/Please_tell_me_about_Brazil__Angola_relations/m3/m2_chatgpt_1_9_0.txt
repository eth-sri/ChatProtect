  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have had a complex and dynamic relationship since the 1960s, with ties that extend beyond the realm of diplomacy to encompass economic, cultural, and political cooperation. In the early 1960s, Brazil supported Angola's fight for independence from Portugal, providing military training and financial assistance to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). After Angola gained independence in 1975, Brazil established diplomatic relations with the country and provided significant economic aid, with a focus on infrastructure development and trade. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil's relations with Angola cooled due to disagreements over the civil war raging in Angola. The United States and apartheid South Africa backed UNITA and the FNLA. Since the end of the civil war in 2002, Brazil has significantly increased its engagement with Angola. In 2010, Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Angola, and the two countries signed a number of agreements on trade, energy, and infrastructure. In recent years, Brazil has become one of Angola's largest trading partners, with bilateral trade amounting to over $10 billion in 2020. Brazil has also played a major role in Angola's economic development, particularly in the areas of agriculture, mining, and energy.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Statement 1 highlights the fact that Brazilian companies have invested heavily in Angola, while Statement 2 specifies that these investments have been focused on the natural resources sector, particularly in oil, iron ore, and diamonds. Both statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economic cooperation between the two countries."
