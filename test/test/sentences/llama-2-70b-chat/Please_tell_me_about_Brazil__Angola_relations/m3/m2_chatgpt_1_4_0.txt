  "prefix": "  Brazil and Angola have had a complex and dynamic relationship since the 1960s, with ties that extend beyond the realm of diplomacy to encompass economic, cultural, and political cooperation. In the early 1960s, Brazil supported Angola's fight for independence from Portugal, providing military training and financial assistance to the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). After Angola gained independence in 1975, Brazil established diplomatic relations with the country and provided significant economic aid, with a focus on infrastructure development and trade. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brazil's relations with Angola cooled due to disagreements over the civil war raging in Angola.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but rather provide additional context to the complex relationship between Brazil and Angola. The first statement highlights the involvement of external powers, such as the United States and apartheid South Africa, in supporting different factions during Angola's fight for independence. The second statement further emphasizes this by specifying that the US and South Africa supported UNITA, a group that opposed the communist government of Angola. Both statements contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the historical and political factors that have shaped Brazil-Angola relations."
