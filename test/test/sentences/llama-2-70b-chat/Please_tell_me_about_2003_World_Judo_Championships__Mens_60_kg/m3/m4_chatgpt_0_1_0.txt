  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Joachim Bottieau of Germany won a bronze medal, while statement 2 says that he won the gold medal. It is not possible for an athlete to win both the gold and bronze medals in the same event. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
