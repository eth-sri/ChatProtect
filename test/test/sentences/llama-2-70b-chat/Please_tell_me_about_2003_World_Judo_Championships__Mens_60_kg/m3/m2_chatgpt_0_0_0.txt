  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the championship was held in Paris, France, while statement 2 claims that it was held in Osaka, Japan. These two locations are different, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
