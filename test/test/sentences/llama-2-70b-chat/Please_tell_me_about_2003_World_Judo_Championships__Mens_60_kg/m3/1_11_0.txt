  "prefix": "  The 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg was a competition held in Osaka, Japan, from September 12 to September 14, 2003. This event was part of the 2003 World Judo Championships, which were the 27th edition of the tournament. The Men's 60 kg division was one of the lightest weight classes in the competition, and it featured judokas from all over the world. The competition was a single-elimination tournament, with each match being a best-of-five contest. The judokas were seeded based on their ranking and world ranking points. The gold medalist of this division was Besik Kudukhov of Russia, who defeated Wang Ki-Chun of South Korea in the final match. Kudukhov had previously won the silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was looking to upgrade to gold in Osaka. He dominated the competition, winning all of his matches by ippon, including the final against Wang. Wang, on the other hand, had a tougher road to the final. He faced stiff competition from the likes of Takahiro Nakai of Japan and Amar Something of Mongolia, but he managed to overcome them both to make it to the final. Despite his best efforts, he was unable to overcome Kudukhov's strong performance and settled for silver.",
