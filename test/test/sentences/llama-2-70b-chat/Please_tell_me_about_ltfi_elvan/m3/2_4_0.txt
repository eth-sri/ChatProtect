  "prefix": "  L\u00fctfi Elvan is a Turkish mathematician and academic who has made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of algebraic geometry and number theory. He was born in 1960 in Istanbul, Turkey, and received his PhD in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. Elvan's research has focused on the study of algebraic varieties and their cohomology, as well as the arithmetic of number fields. He has introduced several important concepts and techniques in these areas, including the notion of \"Elvan's formula\" for computing the cohomology of algebraic varieties, and the \"Elvan-Soudry theorem\" on the arithmetic of number fields.",
