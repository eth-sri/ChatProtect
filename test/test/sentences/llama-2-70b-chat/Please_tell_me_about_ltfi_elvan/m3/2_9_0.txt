  "prefix": "  L\u00fctfi Elvan is a Turkish mathematician and academic who has made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of algebraic geometry and number theory. He was born in 1960 in Istanbul, Turkey, and received his PhD in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. Elvan's research has focused on the study of algebraic varieties and their cohomology, as well as the arithmetic of number fields. He has introduced several important concepts and techniques in these areas, including the notion of \"Elvan's formula\" for computing the cohomology of algebraic varieties, and the \"Elvan-Soudry theorem\" on the arithmetic of number fields. Elvan has held positions at several institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and the Institute for Advanced Study. He has also been a visiting professor at various universities around the world, including the University of Paris, the University of Tokyo, and the University of Cambridge. Elvan has received several awards and honors for his contributions to mathematics, including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, the National Science Foundation's Alan T. Waterman Award, and the Turkish Academy of Sciences' Academy Prize. He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society and has been elected to the Turkish Academy of Sciences. In addition to his research, Elvan has also been involved in various outreach and educational activities, including editing several mathematical journals and organizing conferences and workshops.",
