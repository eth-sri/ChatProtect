  "prefix": "  L\u00fctfi Elvan is a Turkish mathematician and academic who has made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of algebraic geometry and number theory. He was born on October 19, 1961, in Istanbul, Turkey, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1985. Elvan's research focuses on the study of algebraic varieties and their geometric and arithmetic properties. He has made important contributions to the theory of moduli spaces, which are spaces that parameterize the possible shapes and structures of algebraic varieties. He has also worked on the study of automorphic forms and their connections to number theory and algebraic geometry. Elvan is known for his work on the theory of \"Langlands programs,\" which are a set of conjectures and results that connect different areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory. He has also made important contributions to the study of \"arithmos\", which are geometric invariants that describe the arithmetic of algebraic varieties. Elvan has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to mathematics, including the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics and the 2017 Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He is a member of several prestigious scientific organizations, including the Turkish Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. In addition to his research, Elvan is also known for his work as a teacher and mentor.",
