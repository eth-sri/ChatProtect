  "prefix": "  C.T. C.T. Blackfan was a pioneer in the field of pediatrics. C.T. Blackfan graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1889. Blackfan was one of the first doctors to specialize in the care of children, at a time when pediatrics was still a relatively new and underdeveloped field of medicine. Blackfan made significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of various childhood diseases, including measles, pneumonia, and infantile paralysis. He was also a strong advocate for the importance of proper nutrition and hygiene in childhood development. One of Blackfan's most notable contributions was his work on the prevention and treatment of rickets, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin D. Blackfan discovered that exposing children to sunlight could help prevent rickets, and he promoted the use of cod liver oil as a source of vitamin D. His work on rickets helped to significantly reduce the incidence of the disease in the early 20th century. Blackfan was also a prolific writer and educator, publishing numerous articles and textbooks on pediatrics. He was a founder of the American Academy of Pediatrics and served as its president from 1923 to 1924. Throughout his career, Blackfan was recognized for his dedication to improving the health and well-being of children. He was awarded numerous honors and awards, including the Albert Lasker Award for Medical Research in 1949.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his death in 1940 and his legacy as a pioneer in the field of pediatrics and advocate for children's health. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes his groundbreaking research, while statement 1 focuses on his age at the time of his death."
