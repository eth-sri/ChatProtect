  "prefix": " C. T. Blackfan (1866-1947) was a pioneer in the field of pediatrics, particularly in the area of nutrition and metabolism. He began his career as a pediatrician in Boston and quickly became known for his expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases. In 1908, he was appointed as the first full-time pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital. Blackfan made significant contributions to the field of pediatrics, particularly in the area of nutrition and metabolism. In the early 20th century, he conducted a series of studies on the nutritional needs of infants and developed the first widely accepted formula for infant feeding. His formula, known as \"Blackfan's Formula,\" consisted of a mixture of cow's milk, sugar, and lime water, and was designed to provide infants with the necessary nutrients for growth and development.",
