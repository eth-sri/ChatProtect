Blackfan (1866-1947) was an American pediatrician and medical researcher who made significant contributions to the field of pediatrics, particularly in the area of nutrition and metabolism. Blackfan was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1893. He began his career as a pediatrician in Boston and quickly became known for his expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases. In 1908, he was appointed as the first full-time pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, where he established the hospital's first pediatric clinic. Blackfan's most notable contribution to pediatrics was his work on infant nutrition. In the early 20th century, he conducted a series of studies on the nutritional needs of infants and developed the first widely accepted formula for infant feeding.",
