  "prefix": "  C.T. Blackfan was an American pediatrician and clinical geneticist who made significant contributions to the field of medical genetics, particularly in the area of inborn errors of metabolism. He was born in 1879 and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1904. After completing his training, Blackfan moved to Boston Children's Hospital, where he established the first clinical genetics unit in the United States. Blackfan's work focused on understanding the genetic basis of inherited diseases, and he was one of the first researchers to propose that many genetic disorders were caused by errors in the body's metabolic processes. He identified several inborn errors of metabolism, including phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease, and homocystinuria. Blackfan was also a pioneer in the use of diagnostic testing for genetic disorders. He developed a method for measuring the levels of amino acids in the blood, which allowed him to diagnose and monitor genetic disorders such as PKU.",
