  "prefix": "  C.T. C.T. C.T. C.T. Blackfan was an American pediatrician and clinical geneticist who made significant contributions to the field of medical genetics, particularly in the area of inborn errors of metabolism. After completing his training, Blackfan moved to Boston Children's Hospital, where he established the first clinical genetics unit in the United States. Blackfan's work focused on understanding the genetic basis of inherited diseases, and he was one of the first researchers to propose that many genetic disorders were caused by errors in the body's metabolic processes. He identified several inborn errors of metabolism, including phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease, and homocystinuria. Blackfan was also a pioneer in the use of diagnostic testing for genetic disorders. He developed a method for measuring the levels of amino acids in the blood, which allowed him to diagnose and monitor genetic disorders such as PKU. He also advocated for the use of dietary therapy as a treatment for certain genetic disorders, recognizing that changes in diet could help alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Blackfan was a prolific researcher and published numerous papers on his findings. He was also a respected teacher and mentor, training many aspiring geneticists who went on to make important contributions in the field. Throughout his career, Blackfan was recognized for his contributions to medicine and genetics.",

  "explanation": "The statements about C.T. Blackfan are not contradictory. Statement 1 simply mentions that he was awarded the Albert Lasker Award, while statement 2 provides more specific information about the award he received (i.e. the Albert Lasker Award for Medical Research in 1978). Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
