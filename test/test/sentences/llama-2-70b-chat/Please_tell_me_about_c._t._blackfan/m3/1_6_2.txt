  "orig": "One of Blackfan's most notable contributions was his work on the prevention and treatment of rickets, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin D. Blackfan discovered that exposing children to sunlight could help prevent rickets, and he promoted the use of cod liver oil as a source of vitamin D. His work on rickets helped to significantly reduce the incidence of the disease in the early 20th century.",

  "prefix": "  C.T. Blackfan was an American physician and pioneer in the field of pediatrics. He was born in 1864 in Boston, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1889. Blackfan was one of the first doctors to specialize in the care of children, at a time when pediatrics was still a relatively new and underdeveloped field of medicine. Blackfan made significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of various childhood diseases, including measles, pneumonia, and infantile paralysis. He was also a strong advocate for the importance of proper nutrition and hygiene in childhood development.",
