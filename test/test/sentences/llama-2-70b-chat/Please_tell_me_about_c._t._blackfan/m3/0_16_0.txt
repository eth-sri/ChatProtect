  "prefix": "  C. T. Blackfan (1866-1947) was an American pediatrician and medical researcher who made significant contributions to the field of pediatrics, particularly in the area of nutrition and metabolism. Blackfan was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1893. He began his career as a pediatrician in Boston and quickly became known for his expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases. In 1908, he was appointed as the first full-time pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, where he established the hospital's first pediatric clinic. Blackfan's most notable contribution to pediatrics was his work on infant nutrition. In the early 20th century, he conducted a series of studies on the nutritional needs of infants and developed the first widely accepted formula for infant feeding. His formula, known as \"Blackfan's Formula,\" consisted of a mixture of cow's milk, sugar, and lime water, and was designed to provide infants with the necessary nutrients for growth and development. Blackfan's work on nutrition also led him to investigate the causes of rickets, a disease that was prevalent among children at the time. He discovered that rickets was caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, which is essential for the absorption of calcium in the body. Blackfan's discovery led to the development of vitamin D-enriched foods and the virtual elimination of rickets in developed countries. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a skilled clinician and teacher. He was known for his ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of pediatric conditions, and he trained many generations of pediatricians at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital. Throughout his career, Blackfan received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to pediatrics. He was elected as the president of the American Pediatric Society in 1926 and was awarded the society's John Howland Medal in 1936. He also served as the president of the Harvard Medical Alumni Association and was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1938. Blackfan's legacy in pediatrics continues to be celebrated today.",
