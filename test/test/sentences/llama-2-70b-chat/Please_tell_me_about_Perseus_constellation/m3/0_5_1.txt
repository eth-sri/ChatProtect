It is one of the 48 ancient Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy, and is still recognized as a constellation today. Perseus is situated near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. The constellation is home to several notable celestial objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a large galaxy cluster located approximately 240 million light-years away. The cluster is visible as a faint, diffuse patch in the constellation, and is made up of hundreds of galaxies that are held together by gravity.",
