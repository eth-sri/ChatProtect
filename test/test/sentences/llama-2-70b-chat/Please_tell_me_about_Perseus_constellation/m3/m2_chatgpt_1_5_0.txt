The constellation is situated near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga, and is visible from most of the Northern Hemisphere. It is best visible during the months of September, October, and November. Perseus is formed by a group of stars that are thought to have formed around 100 million years ago.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention Algol, which is a star located in the constellation of Perseus. The first statement provides additional information about Algol, including its nickname and the fact that it varies in brightness over a period of 2.87 days. The second statement highlights the prominence of Algol within the constellation of Perseus. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide different perspectives on the same topic."
