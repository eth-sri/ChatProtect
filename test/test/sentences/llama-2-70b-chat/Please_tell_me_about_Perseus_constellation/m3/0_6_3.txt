It is one of the 48 ancient Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy, and is still recognized as a constellation today. Perseus is situated near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. The constellation is home to several notable celestial objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a large galaxy cluster located approximately 240 million light-years away. The cluster is visible as a faint, diffuse patch in the constellation, and is made up of hundreds of galaxies that are held together by gravity. Perseus also contains several variable stars, including Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which is a binary star system that varies in brightness as the two stars orbit each other.",
