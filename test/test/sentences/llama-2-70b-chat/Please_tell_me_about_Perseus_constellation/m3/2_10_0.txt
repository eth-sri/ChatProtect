  "prefix": "  Perseus is a constellation located in the northern hemisphere, named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus. It is one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky, due to its distinctive shape and the presence of several bright stars. The constellation is located near the constellation Cassiopeia and the North Star (Polaris). It is visible from most of the Northern Hemisphere, and is best visible during the months of September and October. Perseus is home to several notable stars, including Algol, a binary star system that is also known as the \"Demon Star\" due to its unusual brightness fluctuations. Another notable star in Perseus is M31, a spiral galaxy that is visible with binoculars or a small telescope. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a large galaxy cluster that is visible with a small telescope. The constellation also contains several nebulae, including the Perseus Nebula, a reflection nebula that is illuminated by the star Algol. In Greek mythology, Perseus was a hero who defeated the Gorgon Medusa and saved the princess Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus. The constellation Perseus is associated with the hero's figure, with the star Algol representing the head of Medusa.",
