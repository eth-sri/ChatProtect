  "prefix": "  Perseus is a constellation located in the northern hemisphere, named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus. It is one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky, due to its distinctive shape and the presence of several bright stars. The constellation is situated near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga, and is visible from most of the Northern Hemisphere. It is best visible during the months of September, October, and November. Perseus is formed by a group of stars that are thought to have formed around 10 million years ago. The brightest star in the constellation is Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which is a binary star that varies in brightness over a period of 2.87 days. Other notable stars in the constellation include Mirfak, a bright white star located in the constellation's \"chest,\" and Algol's neighbor, Almach, a blue-green star that is thought to be a multiple star system. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, a large galaxy cluster that is located near the constellation's center, and the Double Cluster, a pair of open clusters that are located in the constellation's northern region. The constellation is also known for its association with the Perseid meteor shower, which occurs annually in August and is one of the most popular meteor showers of the year. In Greek mythology, Perseus was a hero who was known for his bravery and his ability to defeat Medusa, a monster that had snakes for hair and the ability to turn people to stone with a single glance. The constellation is said to represent the hero's figure in the sky, with Algol representing thehead of Medusa.",
