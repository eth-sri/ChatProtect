  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. They both refer to the Perseus Nebula, but provide different information about it. Statement 1 describes the Perseus Nebula as a reflection nebula that is visible due to nearby stars, while Statement 2 describes it as a diffuse nebula known for its blue color and shape. These descriptions do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about the same object."
