The constellation is situated near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga, and is visible from most of the Northern Hemisphere. It is best visible during the months of September, October, and November. Perseus is formed by a group of stars that are thought to have formed around 100 million years ago.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention Algol, which is a star located in the constellation of Perseus. The first statement describes Algol as a binary star that varies in brightness, while the second statement identifies Algol as Beta Persei, a bright, multiple star system. These statements provide different information about Algol, but they do not contradict each other."
