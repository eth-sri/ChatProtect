  "prefix": "  Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Quitman, Georgia, United States. It was built in 1852 by Dr. William H. Bailey, a prominent local physician, and is considered one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the state. The house is characterized by its symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, which features a grand portico with four Doric columns. The front door is flanked by sidelights and topped with a transom, and the windows are adorned with pediments and shutters. The interior features a central hallway with a sweeping staircase, and the rooms are decorated with elaborate moldings and mantels. The house remained in the Bailey family until 1902, when it was purchased by William H. Thompson, a wealthy businessman. Thompson made significant changes to the property, including adding a carriage house and a large Victorian-style addition to the rear of the house. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public as a museum. It is operated by the Quitman Historic Preservation Society and offers tours of the house and its gardens.",
