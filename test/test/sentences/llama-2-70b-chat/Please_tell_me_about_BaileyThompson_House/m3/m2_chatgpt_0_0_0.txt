  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the house was built in 1852 by Dr. William H. Bailey, while statement 2 claims that it was built in 1902. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different dates for the construction of the house. Therefore, they are contradictory."
