  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. The first statement claims that the house was built by William Bailey, while the second statement claims that it was built by John Bailey. Since these are two different names, it is impossible for both statements to be true. Therefore, they contradict each other."
