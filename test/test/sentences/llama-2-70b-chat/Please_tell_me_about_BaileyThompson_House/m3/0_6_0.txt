Bailey, a prominent local physician, and is considered one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the state. The house is characterized by its symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, which features a grand portico with four Doric columns. The front door is flanked by sidelights and topped with a transom, and the windows are adorned with pediments and shutters. The interior features a central hallway with a sweeping staircase, and the rooms are decorated with elaborate moldings and mantels. The house remained in the Bailey family until 1902, when it was purchased by William H. Thompson, a wealthy businessman.",
