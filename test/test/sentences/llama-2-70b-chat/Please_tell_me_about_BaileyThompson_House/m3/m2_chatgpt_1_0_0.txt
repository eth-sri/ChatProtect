  "explanation": "The statements about Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory as they suggest different organizations received the donation of the house. Statement 1 claims that the Kerr County Historical Society received the donation, while Statement 2 claims that the National Trust for Historic Preservation received the donation. Therefore, it is unclear which organization actually received the donation of the Bailey-Thompson House."
