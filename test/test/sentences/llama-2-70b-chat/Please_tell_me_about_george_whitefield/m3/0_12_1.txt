  "prefix": "  George Whitefield (1714-1770) was a British Anglican priest and evangelist who played a significant role in the evangelical revival of the 18th century. He was known for his powerful and emotive preaching style, which drew large crowds and helped to spread the message of Methodism. Whitefield was born in Gloucestershire, England, and educated at Oxford University, where he became friends with John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. He was ordained as a priest in 1736 and began preaching in London, where his fiery sermons attracted large crowds. He became known as the \"Grand Itinerant\" for his extensive travels throughout Britain and the American colonies, preaching in open fields, churches, and town squares. Whitefield's preaching emphasized the importance of personal conversion, the authority of the Bible, and the power of the Holy Spirit. He believed that salvation was available to all people, regardless of their social class or background, and his message resonated with both the aristocracy and the working class. He was also known for his advocacy of social justice, particularly in his criticism of slavery and the slave trade. Whitefield's influence extended beyond the religious sphere. He was a strong supporter of the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. He also played a role in the development of the Methodist Church, which was founded by John Wesley. Despite his success, Whitefield's life was not without controversy.",
