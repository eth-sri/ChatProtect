  "prefix": "  George Whitefield (1714-1770) was a British Anglican priest and evangelist who played a significant role in the Evangelical Revival of the 18th century. He was known for his powerful and emotive preaching style, which attracted large crowds and helped to spread Methodism throughout Britain and the American colonies. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and educated at Oxford University. He was ordained as a priest in 1736 and became a member of the Methodist movement, which emphasized personal conversion, Evangelical faith, and social reform. He quickly became a popular preacher, known for his passionate and emotive sermons, which often moved listeners to tears and conviction. Whitefield's preaching tours took him throughout Britain and the American colonies, where he attracted large crowds and influenced many people, including Benjamin Franklin, who wrote about his powerful preaching style. Whitefield was also a strong advocate for social reform, particularly in the areas of education and slavery. He founded several schools and orphanages, and he advocated for the abolition of slavery, which was a controversial position at the time.",
