He was known for his powerful and emotive preaching style, which drew large crowds and helped to spread the message of Methodism. Whitefield was born in Gloucestershire, England, and educated at Oxford University, where he became friends with John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. He was ordained as a priest in 1736 and began preaching in London, where his fiery sermons attracted large crowds.",
