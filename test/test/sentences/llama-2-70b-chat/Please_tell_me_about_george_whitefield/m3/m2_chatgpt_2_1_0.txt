  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about George Whitefield are contradictory. The first statement says that he was educated at Oxford University, while the second statement specifies that he was educated at Pembroke College, which is a constituent college of Oxford University. However, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about where Whitefield received his education."
