  "prefix": "  George Whitefield (1714-1770) was a British Anglican priest and evangelist who played a significant role in the evangelical revival of the 18th century. He was known for his powerful and emotive preaching style, which drew large crowds and helped to spread the message of Methodism. Whitefield was born in Gloucestershire, England, and educated at Oxford University, where he became friends with John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. He was ordained as a priest in 1736 and began preaching in London, where his fiery sermons attracted large crowds. He became known as the \"Grand Itinerant\" for his extensive travels throughout Britain and the American colonies, preaching in open fields, churches, and town squares. Whitefield's preaching emphasized the importance of personal conversion, the authority of the Bible, and the power of the Holy Spirit.",
