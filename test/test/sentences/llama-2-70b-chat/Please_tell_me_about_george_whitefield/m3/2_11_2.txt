  "prefix": "  George Whitefield (1714-1770) was a British Anglican priest, evangelist, and one of the founders of Methodism. Born in Gloucester, England, he was educated at Oxford University, where he became associated with the Wesleyan movement, led by John and Charles Wesley. Whitefield was known for his powerful and emotive preaching style, which was characterized by a strong emphasis on personal conversion, the authority of the Bible, and the importance of evangelism. He preached extensively throughout Britain and the American colonies, sparking a religious revival that was influential in the development of evangelicalism. Whitefield's preaching was not limited to traditional church settings. He often preached in open fields, town squares, and other public places, earning him the nickname \"the apostle of the open field.\" He was also known for his ability to attract large crowds, with some estimates suggesting that he preached to more than 100,000 people at a single sermon in London's Moorfields. Whitefield's theology was rooted in Calvinistic Methodism, and he emphasized the importance of personal holiness, evangelism, and social justice. He was also a strong advocate for the abolition of slavery and the education of children. Throughout his life, Whitefield was involved in various religious controversies, including a disagreement with the Wesleys over the nature of sanctification. Nevertheless, his influence on the development of evangelicalism cannot be overstated.",
