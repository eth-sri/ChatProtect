In 1956, he returned to Montreal and joined the faculty of the University of Montreal, where he became a professor of biochemistry and metabolism. Seguin's research focused on the metabolism of amino acids, particularly the ways in which the human body uses and processes these essential building blocks of proteins. He made significant contributions to our understanding of the role of amino acids in various physiological processes, including the synthesis of proteins, the production of energy, and the detoxification of harmful substances. In addition to his research, Seguin was a passionate advocate for science education and communication. He believed that science should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level. He hosted a weekly radio show called \"Le scientifiqueish\" which explored various scientific topics in an engaging and accessible way. He also hosted a popular television show called \"sciencescope.\" Seguin's contributions to science and science communication were recognized with numerous honors and awards during his career.
