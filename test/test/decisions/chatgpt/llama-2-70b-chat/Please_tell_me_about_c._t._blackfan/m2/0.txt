In 1908, he was appointed as the first full-time pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, where he established the hospital's first pediatric clinic. Blackfan's most notable contribution to pediatrics was his work on infant nutrition. In the early 20th century, he conducted a series of studies on the nutritional needs of infants and developed the first widely accepted formula for infant feeding. His formula, known as \"Blackfan's Formula,\" consisted of a mixture of cow's milk, sugar, and lime water, and was designed to provide infants with the necessary nutrients for growth and development. Blackfan's work on nutrition also led him to investigate the causes of rickets, a disease that was prevalent among children at the time. He discovered that rickets was caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, which is essential for the absorption of calcium in the body. Blackfan's discovery led to the development of vitamin D-enriched foods and the virtual elimination of rickets in developed countries. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a skilled clinician and teacher. He was known for his ability to diagnose and treat a wide range of pediatric conditions, and he trained many generations of pediatricians at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital. Throughout his career, Blackfan received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to pediatrics. He was elected as the president of the American Pediatric Society in 1926 and was awarded the society's John Howland Medal in 1936.",
