The show's main premise revolves around Fran's attempts to find love for her clients while also navigating her own dating life. Each episode features a new match for one of Fran's clients, often with comedic and sometimes disastrous results. Throughout the series, Fran also struggles with her own relationships, particularly her on-again, off-again romance with Paul.
