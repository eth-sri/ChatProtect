Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford. He became an Anglican priest and developed a reputation as a powerful preacher, known for his enthusiastic and emotional style. He gained a large following in England and became a popular figure in the religious and social life of London. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America to serve as a missionary to the British colonists.

During his time in America, Whitefield traveled extensively, preaching to large crowds in cities and towns throughout the colonies. He established a network of supporters and built a number of churches, including one in Philadelphia that became known as Whitefield's Tabernacle.
