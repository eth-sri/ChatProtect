      "prefix_original": "George Whitefield (1714-1770) was an English Anglican cleric who played a significant role in the spiritual and social development of early America. He was one of the leaders of the Great Awakening, a period of religious revival in the 18th century that swept through the British colonies in America. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford. He became an Anglican priest and developed a reputation as a powerful preacher, known for his enthusiastic and emotional style. He gained a large following in England and became a popular figure in the religious and social life of London. In 1738, Whitefield sailed to America to serve as a missionary to the British colonists. He was initially met with skepticism and even hostility from many of the established clergymen in the colonies, who saw him as a threat to their authority. However, Whitefield's powerful preaching and personal charisma soon won over many audiences, and he became a major figure in the Great Awakening. During his time in America, Whitefield traveled extensively, preaching to large crowds in cities and towns throughout the colonies. He established a network of supporters and built a number of churches, including one in Philadelphia that became known as Whitefield's Tabernacle. He also played a significant role in the founding of the University of Georgia, which was chartered in 1785. Whitefield's influence extended beyond the religious sphere, as he became involved in a number of social and political issues of the day. He was a strong supporter of the American Revolution, and his sermons were often filled with messages of patriotism and resistance to British oppression. Whitefield returned to England in 1770, where he continued to preach and write until his death in 1770. He was buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.",
