      "prefix_original": "English Arts and Crafts architecture refers to a movement in architectural design that originated in England during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The movement was influenced by the broader Arts and Crafts movement, which sought to revive traditional craftsmanship techniques and emphasized the use of natural materials and detailed craftsmanship. The movement was a reaction to the increasing industrialization and mass production of the age, aiming to promote the ideals of beauty, utility, and harmony with nature. Characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n1. Asymmetry: Arts and Crafts buildings often showcase asymmetrical facades, with irregular layouts and an emphasis on organic forms. 2. Use of natural and local materials: The architecture prioritizes the use of local, natural materials, such as stone or timber, in order to maintain a strong connection with the surrounding environment. 3. Emphasis on craftsmanship: This style focuses on exceptional craftsmanship and detailed, hand-crafted features. This is often evident in the intricate woodwork or ornamental metalwork of Arts and Crafts buildings. 4. Simple forms and clear construction: English Arts and Crafts architecture often features simple, functional designs without excessive ornamentation. The structure and construction of the building are usually clear and straightforward, emphasizing the importance of utility. 5. Vernacular influences: The movement drew inspiration from traditional English vernacular architecture, incorporating features such as steeply pitched roofs, large chimneys, and half-timbering. 6. Integration with nature: Arts and Crafts buildings tend to feature a strong connection to the natural environment, with an emphasis on blending with the surrounding landscape.",
