      "prefix_original": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a design movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly as a reaction to the mass production and ornate excess of the Victorian era. It aimed to restore the traditional role of craftsmen in architecture, emphasizing simplicity, functionality, and harmony with nature. The movement was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin and the designs of William Morris. Key characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n1. Traditional materials: Arts and Crafts architecture focused on using locally sourced, natural materials such as wood, stone, and brick. The use of these materials added a sense of authenticity and connection to the surrounding landscape. 2. Craftsmanship: A key aim of the movement was to celebrate skilled craftsmanship. Architects and designers in this style often worked closely with artisans to produce high-quality, hand-crafted elements in their buildings, such as wood carvings, stained glass windows, and decorative metalwork. 3. Simple forms and structures: Arts and Crafts architecture tended to feature simple, honest, and functional designs. Ornamentation was kept to a minimum and was often focused on highlighting the natural beauty of the materials used. 4. Integration with nature: Nature served as a primary source of inspiration for Arts and Crafts architects. Buildings were designed to harmonize with their surroundings, and gardens were considered an integral part of the overall design. This often resulted in the use of large windows, allowing natural light to enter the interior spaces and connect the inhabitants with the outdoors. 5.",

      "prefix_original": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a design movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly as a reaction to the mass production and ornate excess of the Victorian era. It aimed to restore the traditional role of craftsmen in architecture, emphasizing simplicity, functionality, and harmony with nature. The movement was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin and the designs of William Morris. Key characteristics of English Arts and Crafts architecture include:\n\n1. Traditional materials: Arts and Crafts architecture focused on using locally sourced, natural materials such as wood, stone, and brick. The use of these materials added a sense of authenticity and connection to the surrounding landscape. 2. Craftsmanship: A key aim of the movement was to celebrate skilled craftsmanship. Architects and designers in this style often worked closely with artisans to produce high-quality, hand-crafted elements in their buildings, such as wood carvings, stained glass windows, and decorative metalwork. 3. Simple forms and structures: Arts and Crafts architecture tended to feature simple, honest, and functional designs. Ornamentation was kept to a minimum and was often focused on highlighting the natural beauty of the materials used. 4. Integration with nature: Nature served as a primary source of inspiration for Arts and Crafts architects. Buildings were designed to harmonize with their surroundings, and gardens were considered an integral part of the overall design. This often resulted in the use of large windows, allowing natural light to enter the interior spaces and connect the inhabitants with the outdoors. 5. Vernacular influences: Arts and Crafts architects looked to local building traditions to inform their designs. Elements from medieval, Tudor, and vernacular English architecture were often incorporated, such as steeply pitched roofs, exposed timber framing, and asymmetrical layouts. Notable English Arts and Crafts architects include:\n\n- William Morris: A key figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, Morris founded the influential design firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. and later Morris & Co., which produced furniture, textiles, and wallpaper in the Arts and Crafts style. - Philip Webb: A close associate of Morris, Webb designed the iconic Red House, often considered one of the first examples of Arts and Crafts architecture. - C.F.A. Voysey: Voysey was known for his simple, elegant designs that emphasized craftsmanship and integrated with their natural surroundings, such as the Broadleys and The Orchard. - Edwin Lutyens: Lutyens contributed significantly to Arts and Crafts architecture with his large country houses, often in collaboration with the renowned garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. While the English Arts and Crafts movement was primarily focused on domestic architecture, it also had a lasting influence on public and commercial buildings, as well as interior and furniture design.",
