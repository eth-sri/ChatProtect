By maintaining control over the Philippines, Japan hoped to ensure that the essential resources of rubber, oil, and other materials continued to flow into the Japanese empire. During the Thirty-First Army's activation, the situation for Japan had become increasingly dire as the Allied Forces, led by General Douglas MacArthur, began their campaign to recapture the Philippines. Starting with the Battle of Leyte in October 1944, the American and Filipino forces launched an amphibious invasion, aiming to retake the islands. The Thirty-First Army, comprised of various divisions and units, fought tenaciously against these invasion forces in a series of battles, including the Battle of Leyte Gulf, recognized as the largest naval battle of the war. Despite their best efforts, the Japanese forces ultimately succumbed to the numerical superiority of the Allied Forces, suffering significant losses in troops, equipment, and ships. As the war progressed, the remaining elements of the Thirty-First Army retreated to northern Luzon, where they conducted a protracted defense in the mountains until the end of the war in September 1945. By this time, the once-formidable army had become a shell of its former self, with its soldiers afflicted by diseases and malnutrition amid dwindling supplies and resources.
