Statement 1 suggests that Crimson Rose was the first art director of Burning Man, while Statement 2 suggests that she was the only art director of Burning Man. However, it is possible that Crimson Rose was the first art director and later stepped down or was replaced by someone else. Without further information, it is unclear which statement is accurate."
