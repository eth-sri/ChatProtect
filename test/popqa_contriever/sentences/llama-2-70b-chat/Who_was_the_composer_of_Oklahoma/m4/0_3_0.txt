  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Oklahoma!? are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Richard Rodgers was the composer of Oklahoma! and that he collaborated with Oscar Hammerstein II on other successful and notable musicals. The only difference is that statement 1 includes Carousel as another successful musical they collaborated on, while statement 2 does not mention it. However, this does not contradict the fact that Rodgers and Hammerstein worked together on multiple successful musicals."
