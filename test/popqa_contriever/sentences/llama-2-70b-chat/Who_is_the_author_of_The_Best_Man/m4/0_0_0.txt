  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Best Man? are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both Stefan Schwartz and Ed Roe as the authors of the script, while Statement 2 only mentions Stefan Schwartz. Therefore, Statement 2 is a subset of Statement 1, and both statements can be true at the same time."
