  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mexico? are contradictory. The first statement identifies Francisco G\u00f3mez Elizaga as the best composer in Mexico during the 19th century, while the second statement identifies Agust\u00edn El\u00edzaga as the best Mexican composer of his time. These are two different composers with similar last names, and it is unclear which one is being referred to as the composer of Mexico. Therefore, the statements contradict each other and do not provide a clear answer to the prompt."
