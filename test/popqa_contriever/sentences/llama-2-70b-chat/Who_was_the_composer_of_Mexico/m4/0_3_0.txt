  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of Mexico are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Francisco G\u00f3mez Elizaga founded a music press in Mexico where he published his own works and those of other Mexican composers. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Elizaga founded the first music press in Mexico, while statement 1 does not mention that detail. However, both statements agree that Elizaga played a significant role in promoting and publishing the works of Mexican composers."
