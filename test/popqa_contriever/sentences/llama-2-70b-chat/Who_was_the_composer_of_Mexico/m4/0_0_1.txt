  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mexico? are contradictory. The first statement identifies Francisco G\u00f3mez Elizaga as the best composer in Mexico during the 19th century, while the second statement identifies Miguel El\u00edzaga as the best composer. These are two different individuals with different names, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true. It is important to note that the correct name of the composer is Miguel El\u00edzaga, as stated in the second statement."
