  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mexico? are not contradictory. The first statement clearly identifies Francisco G\u00f3mez Elizaga as the composer considered the best in Mexico during the 19th century and provides additional information about his role in the development of classical music in Mexico. The second statement simply adds to the information provided by identifying Elizaga as a pianist in addition to his other roles as a composer and conductor."
