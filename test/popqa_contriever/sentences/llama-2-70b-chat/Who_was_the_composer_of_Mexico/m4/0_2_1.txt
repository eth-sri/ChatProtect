While Francisco G\u00f3mez Elizaga was the composer considered the best in Mexico during the 19th century, he also played a significant role in promoting and developing classical music in Mexico by founding the Philharmonic Society of Mexico and the Philharmonic Academy, which became the first conservatory in the Americas. The fact that the Philharmonic Society of Mexico became the leading cultural institution in the country further highlights Elizaga's impact on the musical life of Mexico."
