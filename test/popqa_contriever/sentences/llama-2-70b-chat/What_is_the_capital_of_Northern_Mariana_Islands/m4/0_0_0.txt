While the text does not explicitly state the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, it does provide information about the Northern Islands Municipality, which covers the northern islands and has no permanent human habitation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands is not located in the Northern Islands Municipality and may be located in one of the other municipalities, such as Saipan, Tinian, or Rota."
