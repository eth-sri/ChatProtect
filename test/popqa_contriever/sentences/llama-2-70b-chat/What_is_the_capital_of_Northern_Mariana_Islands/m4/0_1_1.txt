While the text does not explicitly state the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, statement 1 provides an inference that the capital is located on Saipan based on the location of the mayor's office for the Northern Islands Municipality. Statement 2 provides information about the islands included in the Northern Islands Municipality, which is relevant to understanding the political and geographical structure of the Northern Mariana Islands, but does not contradict statement 1."
