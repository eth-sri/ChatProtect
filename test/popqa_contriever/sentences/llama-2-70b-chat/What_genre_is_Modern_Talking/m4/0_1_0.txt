  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. They both acknowledge that the duo's sound evolved over time, with their initial sound being more mellow and closer to Europop, while their later sound was more uptempo and danceable Eurodance. Both statements also describe the key elements of their sound, such as catchy melodies, electronic beats, and simple lyrics, which are consistent with the synthpop and Eurodance genres. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of Modern Talking's genre."
