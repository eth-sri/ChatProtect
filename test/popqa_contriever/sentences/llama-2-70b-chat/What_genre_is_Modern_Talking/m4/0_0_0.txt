  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the duo's sound evolved over their career, but they are primarily associated with two genres: synthpop and Eurodance. The second statement further elaborates on the evolution of their sound, specifically mentioning the shift from mellow Europop to uptempo Eurodance after their reunion in 1998. Both statements provide complementary information about the genre of Modern Talking."
