  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the duo's sound evolved over time, but they are still primarily associated with the synthpop and Eurodance genres. Statement 2 simply emphasizes that they are primarily synthpop, which is consistent with their early work. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
