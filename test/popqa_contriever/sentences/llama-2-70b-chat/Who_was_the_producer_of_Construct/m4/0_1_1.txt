  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Construct is not a song produced by The Constructus Corporation, but rather a music project that involved collaboration between Jones, DJ Dope of Krushed & Sorted, and Felix Laband. The second statement specifies that \"Man With No Name,\" which was produced by Felix Laband, was a track that emerged from these collaborative sessions and later evolved into The Constructus Corporation outfit. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about the music project and the individuals involved in its production."
