Statement 1 correctly states that the text does not mention the name of the composer of \"Emotions\" and only mentions various compositions without specifying the composer. Statement 2 suggests a hypothetical scenario where the text may have mentioned the composer's name but did not specify it, which is not contradictory to the first statement."
