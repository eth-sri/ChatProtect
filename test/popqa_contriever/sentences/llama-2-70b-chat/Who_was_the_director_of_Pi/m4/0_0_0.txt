  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Pi? are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Larry Shaw as the director of Pi, which refers to the celebration of the mathematical constant pi on March 14th. The second statement identifies Larry Shaw as the director of the Exploratorium, a science museum where he worked for 33 years. While Shaw's role as director of Pi was likely a smaller part of his overall career, both statements are true and do not conflict with each other."
