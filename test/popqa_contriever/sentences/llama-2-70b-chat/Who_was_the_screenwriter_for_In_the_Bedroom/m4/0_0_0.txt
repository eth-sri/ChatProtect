  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for In the Bedroom are not contradictory. Both statements mention Robert Festinger's involvement in writing the screenplay, but the first statement clarifies that he co-wrote it with Todd Field. The second statement is not entirely accurate as it implies that Todd Field was also a screenwriter, when in fact he was only a co-writer with Festinger."
