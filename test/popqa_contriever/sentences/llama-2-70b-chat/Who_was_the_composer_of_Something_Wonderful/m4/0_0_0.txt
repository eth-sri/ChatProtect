  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Something Wonderful\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the composer is not mentioned in the provided text, while statement 2 provides the composer's name as Billy May. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other. However, it should be noted that \"Something Wonderful\" is not the title of any song on Nancy Wilson's album of the same name, so the question of who composed that specific song is not addressed in the given text."
