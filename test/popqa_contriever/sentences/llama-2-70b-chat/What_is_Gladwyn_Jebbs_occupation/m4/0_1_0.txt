  "explanation": "The statements about Gladwyn Jebb's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements mention his role as the Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, which was a temporary position he held in addition to his primary occupation as a civil servant, diplomat, and politician. Statement 2 simply omits the additional information about his primary occupation."
