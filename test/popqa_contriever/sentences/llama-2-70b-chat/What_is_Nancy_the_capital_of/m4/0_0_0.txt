Statement 1 provides additional historical context by mentioning that Nancy was also the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine and the French province of the same name. Statement 2 simply states that Nancy is currently the capital of the French department of Meurthe-et-Moselle. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
