  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Deep Breath? are incomplete and contradictory. The text only mentions that Mann was approached by the producers of \"The Wire\" to shadow their directors during production, but it does not provide information about who directed \"Five Deep Breaths\". Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether Statement 1 or Statement 2 is correct, or if both are incorrect."
