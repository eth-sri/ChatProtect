  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Pygmalion are not contradictory. Both statements are saying that George Bernard Shaw adapted the play into a screenplay for the 1938 film. The only difference is that statement 1 explicitly states that Shaw is the screenwriter, while statement 2 uses the term \"adapted the screenplay\" to imply the same thing."
