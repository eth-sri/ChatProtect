Both statements confirm that Sherwood Schwartz was the producer of the show and wrote many of its episodes, including \"The Producer.\" The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes that Schwartz wrote the majority of the show's episodes, while statement 1 simply mentions that he wrote many of them."
