  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The International? are not contradictory. The first statement provides information about the Director-General of the International Labour Organization during a specific time period mentioned in the text, which includes two different individuals: David A. Morse in 1956 and Blanchard in 1973. The second statement provides information about Blanchard's tenure as Director-General of the International Labour Organization, which began in 1973 and included overseeing the organization's technical cooperation and field activities. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and do not contradict each other."
