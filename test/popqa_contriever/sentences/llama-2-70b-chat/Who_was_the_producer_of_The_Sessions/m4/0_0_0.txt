Both statements agree that John Cale played a significant role in the production of the album, with statement 1 emphasizing his contribution to the musical arrangements and statement 2 specifically identifying him as the creative producer. Norman Dolph's statement supports the idea that Cale had a major influence on the album's production, while statement 2 provides a clear answer to the question of who held the producer role."
