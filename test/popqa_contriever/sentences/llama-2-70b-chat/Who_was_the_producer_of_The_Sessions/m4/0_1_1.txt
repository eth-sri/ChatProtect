  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the lack of credit given to Norman Dolph and John Licata as producers on the original album release. The first statement emphasizes that despite their involvement in recording and engineering the album, they were not credited as producers. The second statement reinforces this point by specifying that they were not credited on the album cover itself."
