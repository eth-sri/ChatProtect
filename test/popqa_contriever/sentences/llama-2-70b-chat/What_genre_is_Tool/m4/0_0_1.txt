  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Tool? are not contradictory. They both describe Tool as a heavy metal band with similarities to Led Zeppelin's guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes, but the second statement adds the adjective \"heaving\" to describe the battering guitar riffs. This difference in wording does not change the overall genre classification of Tool."
