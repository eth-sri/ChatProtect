  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of Left Behind are not contradictory. The first statement refers specifically to the series Left Behind: The Kids, which was written by Jerry B. Jenkins, Tim LaHaye, and Chris Fabry. The second statement refers to the adult series Left Behind, which was written by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye. While the two series are related and share some of the same characters and themes, they are distinct works with different authors."
