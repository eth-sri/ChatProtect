  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Ronneby the capital of?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that Ronneby is the seat of Ronneby Municipality, but it is not the capital of Blekinge County. The capital of Blekinge County is Karlskrona, which is located about 30 kilometers southeast of Ronneby. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect."
