  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Halloween are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Kevin Williamson was involved in various areas of production for the film, but he did not receive a screenwriting credit. The first statement clarifies that someone else was the official screenwriter for the film, while the second statement emphasizes that Williamson's involvement did not extend to being credited as the screenwriter."
