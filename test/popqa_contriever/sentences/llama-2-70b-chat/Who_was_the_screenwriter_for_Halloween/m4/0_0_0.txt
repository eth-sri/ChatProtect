  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Halloween are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Kevin Williamson was not the sole screenwriter for the film, but rather was involved in various areas of production and provided rewrites in character dialogue and helped make alterations and sketches of the script. The second statement simply reiterates that Williamson was not the sole screenwriter, without providing any additional information."
