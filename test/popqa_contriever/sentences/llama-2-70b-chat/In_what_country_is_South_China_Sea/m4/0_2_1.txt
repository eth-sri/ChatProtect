  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the South China Sea is not located in a single country, it is a disputed region claimed by several countries. However, many non-claimant states, including the United States, want the South China Sea to remain international waters, which means it should not be under the control of any one country. The \"freedom of navigation\" operations conducted by these states aim to promote this goal and ensure that the South China Sea remains open to all nations. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the fact that the South China Sea is a disputed region claimed by multiple countries, but also an important international waterway that should remain open to all."
