  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of the Mario franchise are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that while the franchise is primarily known for its platform games, it has also expanded into other genres. Statement 2 simply states that the franchise is a platform game franchise, which is true as the majority of Mario games fall under this genre. Therefore, both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
