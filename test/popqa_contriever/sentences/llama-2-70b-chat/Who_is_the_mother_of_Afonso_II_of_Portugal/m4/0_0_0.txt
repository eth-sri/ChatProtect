  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Afonso II of Portugal are contradictory. The first statement provides the full name of his mother, Teresa Louren\u00e7o Teresa Gille Louren\u00e7o, while the second statement only provides her first name, Teresa Louren\u00e7o. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
