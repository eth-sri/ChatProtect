However, the book's blurb and the press release from Simon & Schuster suggest that the author is Donald Trump.

  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Boat? are contradictory. While Statement 1 suggests that Donald Trump is the author of the book based on the press release from Simon & Schuster, Statement 2 definitively states that Trump is the author. However, Statement 1 only suggests that Trump is the author based on a quote from the company president, while the blurb and press release do not explicitly state that Trump is the author. Therefore, it is unclear whether Trump is actually the author of the book, making the two statements contradictory."
