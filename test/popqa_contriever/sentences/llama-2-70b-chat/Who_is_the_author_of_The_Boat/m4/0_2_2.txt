  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Boat? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the author is Donald Trump, while Statement 2 suggests that the book has been criticized for its controversial and divisive content. However, the blurb and press release do not mention any controversy or divisiveness surrounding the book, and it is unlikely that a children's book about empathy would be intentionally controversial or divisive. Therefore, it is unclear who the author of The Boat is, and the two statements cannot both be true."
