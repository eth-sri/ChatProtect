  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that the ruling dynasty of the state, the House of Hesse-Kassel, was Lutheran. Statement 1 further adds that the state's population was predominantly Lutheran as well. Therefore, both statements are consistent in stating that the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel was a Protestant state, specifically Lutheran."
