  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Russian Empire are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more detailed explanation of the time periods during which Saint Petersburg was the capital, while Statement 2 simply confirms that Saint Petersburg (also known as St. Petersburg) was indeed the capital of the Russian Empire. Both statements are consistent with each other."
