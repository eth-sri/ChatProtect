  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Ten? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Thomas Berger, the author of the novel \"Ten\", was also the screenwriter for the film adaptation. However, statement 2 claims that Donald Heiney was the screenwriter for the film \"Ten\". These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
