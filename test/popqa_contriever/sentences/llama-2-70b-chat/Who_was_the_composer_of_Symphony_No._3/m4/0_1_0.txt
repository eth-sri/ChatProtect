  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of Symphony No. 3 are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Aulis Sallinen was the composer of Symphony No. 3. The only difference is that statement 2 includes the article \"the\" before \"composer,\" which is not necessary for clarity but is grammatically correct."
