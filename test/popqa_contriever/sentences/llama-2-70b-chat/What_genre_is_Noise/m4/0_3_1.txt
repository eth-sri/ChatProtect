  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Noise? are not contradictory. The first statement explains that noise music is not always a single, well-defined genre, but rather a collection of diverse musical styles and approaches that share a focus on sonic experimentation. The second statement supports this by highlighting a common characteristic of noise music, which is the use of unconventional sounds and noise as musical elements that challenge traditional notions of melody and harmony. Both statements are consistent in describing noise music as a genre that is characterized by experimentation and unconventional approaches to sound."
