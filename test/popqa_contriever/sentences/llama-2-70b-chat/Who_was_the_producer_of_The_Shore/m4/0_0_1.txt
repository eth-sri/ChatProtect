  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Shore are not contradictory. Both statements mention that The Far Shore Inc. was the producer of the film, and that it was incorporated by Michael Wieland and Kevin Steed in 1974. The first statement provides additional context by mentioning that the producer was able to secure partial funding from various sources, while the second statement simply states the fact of its incorporation."
