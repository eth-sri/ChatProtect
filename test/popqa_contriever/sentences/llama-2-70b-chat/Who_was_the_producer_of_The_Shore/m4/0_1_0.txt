  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Shore? are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Pierre Lamy joined the film's production team as its executive producer in 1975 and secured the remaining funding needed to complete the film. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence. Statement 1 mentions that Pierre Lamy \"later\" joined as the film's executive producer, while Statement 2 simply states that he joined in 1975. However, both statements convey the same information and do not contradict each other."
