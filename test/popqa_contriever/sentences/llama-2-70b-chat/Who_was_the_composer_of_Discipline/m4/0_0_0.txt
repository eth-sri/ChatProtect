  "explanation": "Statement 2 is more accurate than Statement 1. While it is true that King Crimson is a band, the specific individuals who composed and arranged the music on the album Discipline were Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford, and Tony Levin. Therefore, Statement 2 correctly identifies Robert Fripp as one of the composers of the album, while Statement 1 is too broad and does not provide enough detail. The two statements are not necessarily contradictory, but Statement 2 is more specific and accurate."
