  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Halebidu the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements indicate that Halebidu was the capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 12th century. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that it was the regal capital, while statement 2 simply states that it was the capital."
