  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Missing? are contradictory. Statement 1 refers to the composer of \"One of the Missing \u2013 for those lost in Iraq\" for euphonium as Allen Vizzutti, while Statement 2 refers to the composer of \"Missing\" as Allen Vizzutti. These are two different compositions, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
