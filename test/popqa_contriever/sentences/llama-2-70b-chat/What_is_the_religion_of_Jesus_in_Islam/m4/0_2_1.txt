  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Muslims believe in Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, and that his religion is referred to as \"al-Masih\" or \"the Messiah.\" However, the first statement emphasizes that Muslims believe that the original message of Jesus was lost or altered over time, and that Muhammad came later to restore it. The second statement expands on this by clarifying that the religion of Jesus in Islam is not considered to be Christianity, as Muslims believe that the original message of Jesus was altered over time by his followers, and that the Gospel contained in the New Testament is not the original message that Jesus preached. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the Islamic perspective on the religion of Jesus."
