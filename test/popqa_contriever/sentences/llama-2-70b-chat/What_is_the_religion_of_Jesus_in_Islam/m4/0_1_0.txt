  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel with a new scripture, the Gospel. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the additional information that the Gospel is referred to as \"Injil\" in Islam. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the religion of Jesus in Islam."
