  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Muslims believe in Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, and that his religion is referred to as \"al-Masih\" or \"the Messiah.\" The first statement emphasizes that Muslims believe that the original message of Jesus was lost or altered over time, and that Muhammad came later to restore it. The second statement expands on this idea by stating that the original message of Jesus was lost over time due to corruption and alterations by human hands. Both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Jesus' message was distorted over time and that Muhammad was sent to restore the true message of God."
