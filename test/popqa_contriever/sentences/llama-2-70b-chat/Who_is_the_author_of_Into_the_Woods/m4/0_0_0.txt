  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Into the Woods? are contradictory. Statement 1 attributes the authorship to James Lapine, while also acknowledging his collaboration with Stephen Sondheim on the music and lyrics. Statement 2 solely attributes the authorship to Stephen Sondheim. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
