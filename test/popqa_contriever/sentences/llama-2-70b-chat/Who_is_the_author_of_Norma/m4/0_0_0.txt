  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Norma? are not contradictory, but rather provide different levels of information. Statement 1 provides the author's full name and the fact that she used a pen name, while Statement 2 only provides the pen name. Both statements ultimately refer to the same person, Norma Bagain Toliopoulos, who wrote under the name Norma Khouri."
