While the text does not specify the screenwriter for The Eagle, it does provide information about Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson's work in film and television, including their frequent adaptations of the works of Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. The text also notes that both writers were involved in \"The Twilight Zone\" television series. However, the text does not confirm or deny whether they were involved in the creation of the screenplay for The Eagle. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
