  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the Romanian Greek Catholic Church is a form of Eastern Catholicism that follows the Byzantine liturgical rite. The only difference is that statement 1 provides more specific information about the liturgical rite used by the church, while statement 2 is more general."
