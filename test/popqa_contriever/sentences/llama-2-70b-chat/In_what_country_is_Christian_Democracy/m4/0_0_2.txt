  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While Christian democracy originated in nineteenth-century Europe, it has since influenced political parties and movements in various countries around the world. The second statement specifically mentions several European countries where Christian democracy has had an impact on the political landscape. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that Christian democracy is not limited to one specific country."
