  "explanation": "The statements about the presence of Christian democracy in France are contradictory. The first statement suggests that the Christian Democratic Party (CDS) has been a significant political force in France, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, while the second statement suggests that the CDS was a significant political force in France during the Fourth Republic. However, the Fourth Republic in France lasted from 1946 to 1958, which contradicts the timeline presented in the first statement. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
