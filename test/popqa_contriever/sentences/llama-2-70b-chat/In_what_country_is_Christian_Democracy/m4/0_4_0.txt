  "explanation": "The statements about the countries where Christian democracy has had a significant impact are not contradictory. Both statements mention the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) as a major political force in the Netherlands, with one specifying that it has been so since the 1980s and the other highlighting its significance in the 1980s and 1990s. This shows that the CDA has been a significant player in Dutch politics for several decades, which is consistent with the idea that Christian democracy has influenced political parties and movements in various countries around the world."
