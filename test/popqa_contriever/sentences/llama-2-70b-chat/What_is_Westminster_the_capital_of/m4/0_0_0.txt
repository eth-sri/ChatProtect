  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Westminster the capital of?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Westminster as the capital of the City of Westminster, which is an Inner London borough. However, statement 2 incorrectly identifies Westminster as the capital of Greater London. While Westminster is an important part of Greater London, it is not the capital of the entire region. The capital of Greater London is the City of London, which is a separate entity from the City of Westminster."
