  "explanation": "The statements are contradictory as they both claim that Joseph Holbrooke was the composer of \"The Bells\", while the first sentence of the text mentions that the poem \"The Bells\" was set to music by several composers, including Sergei Rachmaninoff. Therefore, the composer of \"The Bells\" cannot be solely attributed to Joseph Holbrooke."
