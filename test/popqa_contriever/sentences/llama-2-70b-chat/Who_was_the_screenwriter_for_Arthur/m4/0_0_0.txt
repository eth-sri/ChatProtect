  "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect as it states that Robert Arthur was the screenwriter for Arthur, which is not the case. Robert Arthur was a screenwriter and producer himself, but he did not work on any projects related to the name \"Arthur\". Statement 2 is also incorrect as it suggests that Robert Arthur was the screenwriter for himself, which is not possible as he was a screenwriter for various films and not for himself. Therefore, both statements are incorrect and do not provide accurate information about who was the screenwriter for Arthur."
