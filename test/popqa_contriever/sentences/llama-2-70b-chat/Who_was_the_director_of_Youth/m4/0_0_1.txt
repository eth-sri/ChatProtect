  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Youth? are not contradictory. Both statements refer to Lyndon Baines Johnson as the youth director for the state of Texas, with the second statement specifying that he was the director of the National Youth Administration in Texas. The first statement also adds that Johnson later became the 36th President of the United States. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about Johnson's role as a youth director in Texas."
