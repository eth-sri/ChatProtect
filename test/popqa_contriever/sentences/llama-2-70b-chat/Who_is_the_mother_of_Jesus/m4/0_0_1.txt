  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. Both statements identify Mary, also known as Maria or Mariam in Greek, as the mother of Jesus. The difference in the Greek spelling of her name is likely due to variations in transliteration. The argument that the Mary referred to as the mother of James and Joseph is not the same as the mother of Jesus is a separate issue and does not contradict the identification of Mary as Jesus' mother in the Synoptic Gospels."
