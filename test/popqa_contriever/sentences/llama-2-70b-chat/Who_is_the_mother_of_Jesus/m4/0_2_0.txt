  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. Both statements are presenting the same argument, which is that some scholars believe the mother of Jesus mentioned in the crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts in the Synoptics is a different Mary than the mother of Jesus mentioned elsewhere in the Gospels. The first statement explains that this argument is based on the fact that the writers of the Synoptics refer to her as \"the other Mary\" and use a different form of the name Mary (Maria) than they do for the mother of Jesus (Mariam). The second statement explains that this argument is based on the different names used for the mother of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels. Therefore, the statements are complementary and not contradictory."
