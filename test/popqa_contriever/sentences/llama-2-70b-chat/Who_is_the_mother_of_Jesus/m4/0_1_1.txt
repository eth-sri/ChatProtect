The first statement provides the commonly accepted belief that Mary, also known as Maria or Mariam in Greek, is the mother of Jesus according to the Synoptic Gospels. The second statement acknowledges that some scholars argue that the Mary mentioned in the crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts may be a different Mary, but it does not contradict the first statement as it does not claim that Mary is not the mother of Jesus. Additionally, the second statement clarifies that the mother of James and Joseph is not explicitly identified as the mother of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels."
