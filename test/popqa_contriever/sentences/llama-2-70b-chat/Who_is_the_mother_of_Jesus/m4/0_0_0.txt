  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the mother of Jesus is Mary, as described in the Synoptic Gospels. The difference between the two statements is that the first one provides additional information about the various names used for Mary in Greek, while the second statement simply restates the fact that Mary is the mother of Jesus according to the Synoptic Gospels."
