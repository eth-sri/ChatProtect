  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. The first statement provides the commonly accepted belief that Mary, also known as Maria or Mariam in Greek, is the mother of Jesus according to the Synoptic Gospels. The second statement acknowledges that some scholars argue that the Mary mentioned in the crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts may be a different Mary, but it does not contradict the first statement as it still acknowledges the presence of the mother of Jesus in those accounts."
