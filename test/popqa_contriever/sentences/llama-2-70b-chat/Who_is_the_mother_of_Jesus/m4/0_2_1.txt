  "alt": "The writers of the Synoptics refer to her as \"the mother of James and Joseph\" in order to distinguish her from the mother of Jesus.",
  "prefix": " According to the Synoptic Gospels, the mother of Jesus is Mary, also known as Maria or Mariam in Greek. However, some scholars argue that the mother of Jesus mentioned in the crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts in the Synoptics is not the same person as the mother of Jesus, but rather a different Mary, such as Mary the mother of James and Joseph.",

  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. They both acknowledge that the mother of Jesus is Mary, but the second statement is discussing the use of a specific identifier (\"the mother of James and Joseph\") in the Synoptic Gospels to distinguish her from another Mary mentioned in the same accounts. The first statement is discussing the use of a different form of the name Mary (\"Maria\") for this other Mary, further emphasizing the distinction between the two."
