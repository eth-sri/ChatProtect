  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Game Change are not contradictory. They both provide the same information that Danny Strong was the screenwriter for the film and won a Primetime Emmy Award for his work on it. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions that the award was for his work on Game Change, while statement 1 does not specify which project the award was for."
