  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Michael? are contradictory. The given information in the text states that the director's name is not Sandra Levy but rather James Man\u00ed\u00e0t. Sandra Levy is mentioned as the ex-wife of the person being discussed in the text, but there is no indication that she directed the film Michael."
