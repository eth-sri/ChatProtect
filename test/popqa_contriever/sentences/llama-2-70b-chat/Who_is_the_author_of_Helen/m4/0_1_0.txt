  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Helen? are not contradictory. Statement 1 clarifies that \"Helen Epstein\" is not a title of a book or article, but rather the name of a person. Statement 2 provides additional information that \"Helen Epstein\" is an autobiographical work written by the person of the same name. Both statements provide different but complementary information about the subject of the prompt."
