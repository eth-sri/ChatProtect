  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Good News\" are not contradictory. Both statements mention Jonathan Abrahams as the screenwriter, and the second statement simply omits the fact that Matthew Weiner was also involved in writing the episode. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
