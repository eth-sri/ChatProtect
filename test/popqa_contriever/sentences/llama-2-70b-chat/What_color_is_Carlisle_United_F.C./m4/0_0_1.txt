  "explanation": "The statements about the color of Carlisle United F.C. are not contradictory. While statement 1 mentions that the club wore black armbands as a sign of respect, it does not necessarily mean that black is the primary color of the club. Statement 2 clarifies that black is only the color of the club's away kit, which is a secondary kit worn when playing away from home. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
