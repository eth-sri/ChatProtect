  "explanation": "The statements about What color is Carlisle United F.C.? are not contradictory. While statement 1 suggests that black is a color associated with the club, statement 2 indicates that the team's primary colors are blue and white stripes. It is possible for a team to have multiple colors associated with it, and for different colors to be used for different purposes (such as wearing black armbands as a sign of respect). Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
