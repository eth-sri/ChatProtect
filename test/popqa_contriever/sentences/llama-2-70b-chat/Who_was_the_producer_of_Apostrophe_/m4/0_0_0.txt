  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Apostrophes (') are not contradictory. They both provide the same answer that Bernard Pivot was the producer of the show. The only difference is the punctuation used in the first statement, which includes parentheses and an apostrophe, while the second statement does not. However, this does not change the meaning of the statement."
