  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are not contradictory. Both statements mention Theodor Mommsen as the leader of the group of scholars who wrote the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. The first statement provides more context by explaining that the group was commissioned by the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin to create a comprehensive collection of Latin inscriptions, while the second statement simply states that Mommsen led the writing of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum."
