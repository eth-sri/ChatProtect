  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of \"Night of the Demons\" are contradictory. The first statement claims that 7 Arts Productions was the producer, while the second statement claims that Kevin Tenney was the producer. However, the text only mentions that Steve Augustyn was the writer-producer of \"Night of the Demons,\" and does not provide information on who the sole producer was. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct."
