  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Mechanics? are not contradictory, but they are incomplete. While both statements identify Michael Spivak as the author of Mechanics, they do not provide enough information to determine whether this is true or not. The text provided only mentions Spivak's expertise in differential geometry and his work as an expositor of mathematics, but does not mention any specific work on mechanics. Therefore, it is unclear whether Spivak is actually the author of Mechanics or not."
