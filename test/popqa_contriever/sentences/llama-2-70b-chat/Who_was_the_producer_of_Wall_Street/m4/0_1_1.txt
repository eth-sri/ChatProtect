Both statements mention Michael Connor's involvement with \"The Wall Street Journal\" and the \"Wall Street Journal Report,\" but neither statement specifies that he was the producer of the movie \"Wall Street.\" Therefore, there is no contradiction between the statements and the fact that the producer of \"Wall Street\" was not specified in the given text."
