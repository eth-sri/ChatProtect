The first statement clarifies that the given text does not provide information about the producer of the movie \"Wall Street.\" The second statement provides information about Michael Connor's role as a producer for \"The Wall Street Journal Report,\" which is a television program and not related to the movie. Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory but are discussing different productions."
