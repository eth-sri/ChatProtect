  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Emperor An of Jin are not contradictory. Both statements identify Emperor Xiaowu as the father of Emperor An of Jin. The only difference is that statement 1 provides an additional piece of information, which is that Emperor Xiaowu is also known as \"Changming\". Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other."
