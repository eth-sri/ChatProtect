  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Jazz? are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Richard Sudhalter co-wrote the book \"Bix: Man and Legend\" with Philip R. Evans. The first statement adds that the book was the first jazz biography to be nominated for a National Book Award, while the second statement simply states the fact of the co-authorship. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about Sudhalter's work as a jazz historian and author."
