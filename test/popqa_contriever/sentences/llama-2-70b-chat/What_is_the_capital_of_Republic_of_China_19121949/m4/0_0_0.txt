  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Republic of China 1912-1949 are contradictory. The first statement mentions that the capital was Beijing (also known as Nanjing), while the second statement states that the capital was Nanjing. These two cities are not the same, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true. It is important to note that while Nanjing was the initial capital, the government later relocated to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and then to Taipei in 1949 after the Chinese Civil War."
