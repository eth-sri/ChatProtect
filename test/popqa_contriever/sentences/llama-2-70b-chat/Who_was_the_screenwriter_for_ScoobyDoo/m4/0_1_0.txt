They both provide additional information about Davis Doi's involvement in the creation of the Scooby-Doo screenplay and his relationship with Iwao Takamoto. The only difference is that statement 1 uses the word \"occasionally\" to describe the frequency of Doi's consultations with Takamoto, while statement 2 does not."
