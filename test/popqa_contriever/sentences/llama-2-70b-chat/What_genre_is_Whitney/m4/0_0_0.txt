  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Whitney\" are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the film is a documentary, while Statement 2 suggests that it is a biographical drama. While a biographical drama can be a type of documentary, the two terms are not interchangeable. A documentary typically presents factual information and real-life events, while a biographical drama may take creative liberties in its portrayal of events and characters. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
