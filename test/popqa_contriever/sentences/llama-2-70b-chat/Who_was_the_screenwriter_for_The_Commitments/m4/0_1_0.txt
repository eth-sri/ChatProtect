The first statement suggests that Jim Sheridan brought Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais onto the project after working with them on the script with Roddy Doyle. The second statement suggests that Myles and Randall-Cutler brought them on board. However, both statements agree that Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were the screenwriters for The Commitments."
