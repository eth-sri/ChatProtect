  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of The Anniversary are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Alvin Rakoff was the original director but was replaced due to conflicts with Bette Davis, while Statement 2 simply states that Alvin Rakoff was the director. The contradiction lies in the fact that Statement 2 does not acknowledge the fact that Rakoff was replaced during filming, which is mentioned in Statement 1."
