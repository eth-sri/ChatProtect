  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for MASH are contradictory because one includes a comma after \"Lardner\" while the other does not. However, both statements are incorrect as Ring Lardner, Jr. was not the screenwriter for MASH. The novel was written by Richard Hooker (a pseudonym for H. Richard Hornberger) and the screenplay was written by Ring Lardner, Jr."
