  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Big are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Gary Ross co-wrote the screenplay for Big with Anne Spielberg, and that the film earned him an Academy Award nomination and a Writers Guild of America Award. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about Ross's career and other successful films he wrote, while statement 2 focuses solely on his involvement in Big."
