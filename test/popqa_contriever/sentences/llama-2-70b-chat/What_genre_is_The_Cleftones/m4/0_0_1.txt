Both statements mention that the group is known for their doo-wop style of music, with the second statement adding that they are also known for their rhythm and blues music. Therefore, both statements are consistent in identifying doo-wop as the primary genre of The Cleftones, with the second statement acknowledging their incorporation of elements from another genre."
