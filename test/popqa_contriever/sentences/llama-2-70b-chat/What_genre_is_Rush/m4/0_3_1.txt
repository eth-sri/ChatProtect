  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Rush's music on their debut album are not contradictory. They both describe the same thing - the hard rock sound that is typical of many popular rock bands emerging in the 1970s and influenced by bands like Led Zeppelin and Cream. The only difference is in the wording, with one statement using the phrase \"can be classified as\" and the other using the phrase \"as described by\", but both convey the same meaning."
