  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Koxinga? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Koxinga's mother was a woman named Lady Lan, while Statement 2 claims that she was a woman named Lady Peggy. Only one of these statements can be true, and they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
