While statement 1 emphasizes the collaborative effort between the company's members and the directors of individual productions, statement 2 highlights the fact that there was no single director of Renaissance, but rather it was founded by Branagh and Parfitt. Both statements provide different perspectives on the leadership structure of Renaissance, but they do not contradict each other."
