While Statement 2 implies that Kenneth Branagh and David Parfitt were directors of Renaissance, Statement 1 clarifies that there were other directors involved in the company's productions, specifically Judi Dench, Geraldine McEwan, and Derek Jacobi. Therefore, both statements are true and provide different perspectives on the directors involved with Renaissance."
