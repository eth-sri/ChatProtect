  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Mark? are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the director of The Mark is not specified in the text, while statement 2 specifies that the director of The Mark is Jon Amiel. Therefore, one statement denies the existence of information about the director, while the other provides a specific name for the director, creating a contradiction."
