  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Paperboy are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the novel is a work of literary fiction, which typically focuses on character development and explores complex themes. Statement 2, on the other hand, suggests that the novel is a work of crime fiction, which typically centers around a crime and its investigation. While it is possible for a novel to fall under multiple genres, these two genres have distinct characteristics that do not necessarily overlap. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
