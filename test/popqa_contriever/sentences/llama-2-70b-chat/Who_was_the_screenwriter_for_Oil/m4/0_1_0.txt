  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Oil\" are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Paul Thomas Anderson adapted the first 150 pages of the novel into a screenplay. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that he later changed the title to \"There Will Be Blood\". Therefore, both statements provide consistent information about Anderson's involvement in adapting the novel into a screenplay."
