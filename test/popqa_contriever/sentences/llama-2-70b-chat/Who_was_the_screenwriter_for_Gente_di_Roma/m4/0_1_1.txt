Both statements agree that Cesare Zavattini was a prominent Italian screenwriter known for his work in the neorealist movement and his collaborations with directors such as Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini. The only difference is that statement 2 provides more specific information about Zavattini's collaborations with neorealist directors."
