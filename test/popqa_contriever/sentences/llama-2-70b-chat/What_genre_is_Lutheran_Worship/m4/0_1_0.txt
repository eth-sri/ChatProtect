  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Lutheran Worship are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the traditional and liturgical nature of the music in Lutheran Worship, with statement 1 specifically contrasting it with contemporary Christian music and praise songs. Statement 2 further emphasizes the conservative and historical nature of the music, which aligns with the LCMS's stance on maintaining traditional practices. Overall, both statements support the idea that Lutheran Worship represents a traditional and liturgical genre of music within the LCMS."
