  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Parikshit are contradictory. Statement 1 clearly states that the text does not provide information about Parikshit's mother, while statement 2 claims that Madravati is the mother of Parikshit. Therefore, one statement denies the existence of information about Parikshit's mother, while the other provides a specific answer to the question."
