  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that the given text does not provide information about the mother of Parikshit. While statement 1 summarizes the information provided in the text, statement 2 emphasizes that even though Madravati is mentioned as Parikshit's wife and Janamejaya's mother, she does not reveal the name of Parikshit's mother. Therefore, both statements support the fact that the text does not specify the identity of Parikshit's mother."
