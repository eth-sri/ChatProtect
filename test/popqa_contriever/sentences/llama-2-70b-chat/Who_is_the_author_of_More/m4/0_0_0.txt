  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of More? are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that the author of the text about Max More is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be written in an encyclopedic or formal style, indicating that it may be a passage from a reference work or an article written by a third party. The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the word \"formal\" in the first statement, which does not significantly alter the overall meaning."
