  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of More? are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the author of the text is not explicitly stated, while Statement 2 suggests that it may be Max More. These statements do not contradict each other, as it is possible that Max More could have written the text about himself in a formal, encyclopedic style. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine with certainty who the author of the text is."
