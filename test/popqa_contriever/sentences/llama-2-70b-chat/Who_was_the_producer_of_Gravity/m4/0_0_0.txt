  "explanation": "Statement 2 is incorrect and contradictory to Statement 1. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n was the director of the film Gravity, not the producer. DJ Khalil was one of the producers of the soundtrack for the film, which included the song \"Mayday\" featuring Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones. Therefore, Statement 1 is the correct answer to the prompt."
