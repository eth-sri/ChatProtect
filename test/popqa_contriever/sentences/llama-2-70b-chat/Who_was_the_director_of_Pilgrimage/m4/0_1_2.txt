  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of the pilgrimage are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about when John Green was appointed as the director and when he resigned from the position due to his relocation. Statement 2 simply confirms that he did indeed resign in 1995. Both statements are consistent with each other and do not present any conflicting information."
