  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Pilgrimage? are contradictory. Statement 1 says that John Green was appointed director in 1982 and served until 1995, while Statement 2 says that he was appointed director in 1986. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different years for his appointment as director."
