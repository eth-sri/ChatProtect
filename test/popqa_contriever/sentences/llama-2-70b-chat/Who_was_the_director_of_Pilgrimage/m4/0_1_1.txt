  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Pilgrimage? are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that John Green served as the director of the Ampleforth pilgrimage for 13 years, from 1982 to 1995, while Statement 2 suggests that he only served for four years. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
