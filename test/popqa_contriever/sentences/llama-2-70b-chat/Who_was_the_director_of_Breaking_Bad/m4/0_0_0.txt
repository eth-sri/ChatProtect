  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Breaking Bad are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that while Vince Gilligan was involved in directing several episodes of the show, including the season finale, he was primarily known as the creator of the series. Statement 2, on the other hand, directly states that Vince Gilligan was the director of Breaking Bad, implying that directing was his primary role on the show."
