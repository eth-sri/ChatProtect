  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Cows are not contradictory. The first statement specifies that they are a post-hardcore/noise rock band, which means they incorporate elements of both genres into their music. The second statement simply identifies them as a noise rock band, which is a more general classification that still accurately describes their sound. Both statements are true and provide different levels of specificity about the band's genre."
