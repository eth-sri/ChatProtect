  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"The American President\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify Philip Phile as the composer of \"The President's March,\" which was later arranged with lyrics by Joseph Hopkinson and became known as \"Hail Columbia.\" The only difference between the two statements is the wording of the title given to the piece by Hopkinson."
