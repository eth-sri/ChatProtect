  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they are incomplete. While the text does not explicitly state the name of the director of \"Life,\" it does mention that the original script was written and narrated by David Attenborough. It is possible that Attenborough also served as the director, but this is not confirmed in the provided information. Therefore, both statements are technically correct in that the director is not specified, but they do not provide a complete answer."
