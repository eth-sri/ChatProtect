  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Suicide are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Suicide is a pioneering electronic music duo that is often associated with the punk and post-punk genres, and that they have been recognized as highly influential in the underground music scene. The only difference between the two statements is that one emphasizes their lack of mainstream popularity, while the other emphasizes their influence in the electronic and experimental music genres."
