  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Suicide are not necessarily contradictory, as both mention the association with punk music. However, they do differ in the additional genre mentioned - post-punk in statement 1 and synth-pop in statement 2. This suggests that Suicide's music may have elements of both genres, or that their music has been influential in the development of multiple genres."
