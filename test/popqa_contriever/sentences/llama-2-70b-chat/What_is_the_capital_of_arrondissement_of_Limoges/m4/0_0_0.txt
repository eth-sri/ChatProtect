  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of arrondissement of Limoges are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Limoges as the capital of its own arrondissement, which is located in the Haute-Vienne department of France. However, the second statement identifies Limoux as the capital of a different arrondissement, which is located in the Aude department of France. Therefore, the two statements are not referring to the same arrondissement and cannot both be true."
