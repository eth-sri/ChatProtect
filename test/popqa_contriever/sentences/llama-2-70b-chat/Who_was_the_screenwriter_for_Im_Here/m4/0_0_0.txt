  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for I'm Here? are contradictory. The first statement says that Michelle Schumacher and Tony Cummings wrote the screenplay for I'm Here, while the second statement says that they wrote the screenplay for I'm Not Here. These are two different movie titles, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
