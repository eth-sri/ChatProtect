  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both state that the capital of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was Kharkiv from 1917 to 1934, and then it was moved to Kiev in 1934, which remains the capital of Ukraine to this day. Statement 1 provides additional information about the current status of Kiev as the capital of Ukraine, while Statement 2 simply states the year in which the capital was moved."
