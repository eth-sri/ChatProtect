  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic are contradictory. Statement 1 specifies that Kharkiv was the capital from 1917 to 1934, while Statement 2 simply states that Kharkiv was the capital without specifying any time frame. Therefore, Statement 2 could be interpreted as implying that Kharkiv was the capital for the entire existence of the Ukrainian SSR, which would contradict Statement 1."
