  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Cinema? are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information. The first statement clarifies that Cinema was produced in a joint venture between Cinema V and Palevsky, while the second statement specifies that Palevsky also went into independent production with Peter Bart. Therefore, both statements contribute to a more complete understanding of Palevsky's involvement in the production of Cinema."
