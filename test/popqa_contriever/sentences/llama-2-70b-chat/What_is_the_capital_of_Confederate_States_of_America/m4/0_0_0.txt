  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Confederate States of America are not contradictory. Both statements identify Richmond, Virginia as the capital of the Confederacy. The only difference is that the second statement omits the state name, but it still refers to the same city. Therefore, both statements convey the same information and are not contradictory."
