  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of A Man and a Woman are contradictory. The first statement claims that Monta Bell was the producer, while the second statement claims that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the producer. It is possible that Monta Bell was involved in the production of the film in some capacity, but the primary production company was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer."
