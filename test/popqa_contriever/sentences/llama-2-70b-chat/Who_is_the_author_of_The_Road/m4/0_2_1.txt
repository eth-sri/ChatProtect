Both statements acknowledge that the text provided does not mention Cormac McCarthy or his book The Road, and that the list of authors and their works seems to have no connection to it. Statement 1 simply provides a general observation about the text, while Statement 2 specifically notes that The Road is not attributed to any of the authors mentioned. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and with the information provided in the text."
