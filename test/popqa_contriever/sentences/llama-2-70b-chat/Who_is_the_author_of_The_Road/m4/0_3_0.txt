  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Road? are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the prompt may have been intended to ask about a different book or author, while Statement 2 offers an alternative interpretation of the prompt in the context of the list of authors and their works provided earlier. Both statements acknowledge that the prompt as written does not provide enough information to determine the intended meaning with certainty."
