Both statements mention that Buddhism and Daoism were present in the Tang Empire, and that Emperor Xuanzong invited representatives from both religions to his court. Statement 1 provides a more comprehensive explanation of the religious landscape of the Tang Empire, while Statement 2 focuses specifically on the emperor's invitation to representatives of Buddhism and Daoism."
