  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the screenwriter for \"A Trip to the Moon\" is unknown and that the screenplay is not available. The second statement provides additional information about the film's significance as one of the earliest examples of a screenplay, despite the lack of information about the screenwriter. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
