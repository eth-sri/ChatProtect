  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"A Trip to the Moon\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the screenwriter is unknown and that the screenplay is not extant. The second statement suggests that it is likely that George Melies wrote the screenplay himself, based on his roles as director, producer, and star of the film. The second statement also confirms that the film's title is \"A Trip to the Moon,\" which is relevant to the prompt. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about the screenwriter for the first true screenplay."
