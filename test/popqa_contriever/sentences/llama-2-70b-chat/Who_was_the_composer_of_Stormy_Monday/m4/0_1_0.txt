  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Stormy Monday\" are not contradictory. While the passage does not explicitly state who the composer of the song is, it does mention that Lou Rawls recorded the song in 1962 and that Latimore recorded his own version in 1973. Additionally, statement 2 correctly identifies T-Bone Walker as the original composer of the song. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the song's history without contradicting each other."
