  "explanation": "The statements about the director of \"Redemption\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there was a film released in promotion of the album, but the author is not aware of it. The second statement provides additional information that the director of the film was not notable or well-known. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide different pieces of information about the film and its director."
