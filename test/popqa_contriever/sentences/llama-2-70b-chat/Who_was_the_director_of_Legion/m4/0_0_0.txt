  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Legion? are contradictory. The first statement says that \u00c1lvaro Corcuera was the director of the Legion, while the second statement says that Father Heereman was the director of the Legion. This suggests that there was a change in leadership at some point, and both statements cannot be true at the same time."
