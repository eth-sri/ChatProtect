  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that \u00c1lvaro Corcuera was the director of the Legion, but he was on sabbatical for health reasons. The second statement clarifies that during his absence, Father Heereman assumed the responsibility for running the Legion until the convocation of a General Chapter. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the leadership of the Legion during a specific period."
