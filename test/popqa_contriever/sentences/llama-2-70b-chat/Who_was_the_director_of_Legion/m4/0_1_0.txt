  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Legion are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that \u00c1lvaro Corcuera was the director of the Legion, but he was on sabbatical for health reasons. The first statement adds that Father Heereman assumed the responsibility for running the Legion until the convocation of a General Chapter. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the directorship of the Legion during a specific period."
