  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Oliver O'Grady are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that he was a Catholic priest but has been removed from his position, while the second statement simply states that he is Catholic. Being laicized does not necessarily mean that one is no longer Catholic, as it is a process of removing one's status as a priest rather than excommunication from the Catholic Church. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
