Both statements acknowledge that Angelina Jolie was the screenwriter for the film, but statement 1 provides additional information about Jolie's involvement in the film as its director, producer, and co-star with Brad Pitt. Statement 2 simply highlights that Jolie produced the film in collaboration with Pitt."
