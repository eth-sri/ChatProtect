  "explanation": "The statements about the history of Ghana are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the historical name of Ghana, which was the Gold Coast. The first statement clarifies that the Gold Coast was a British colony until 1957, while the second statement simply states that it was a historical name for Ghana. Both statements support the main idea that the country being described in the passage is Ghana."
