  "explanation": "The statements about the history of Ghana are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the historical name of Ghana, which was the Gold Coast during its time as a British colony. Statement 1 explicitly states that the Gold Coast was a British colony until 1957, while Statement 2 simply reiterates that the reference in the passage is also known as the Gold Coast. Both statements support the idea that the country being described in the passage is Ghana."
