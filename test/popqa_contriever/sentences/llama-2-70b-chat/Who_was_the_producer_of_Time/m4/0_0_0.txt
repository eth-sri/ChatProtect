  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Time? are contradictory. Statement 1 identifies Surplice as the producer (dam) of Time Supply, while Statement 2 identifies Willis Sharpe Kilmer as the producer. However, Kilmer was the breeder of Time Supply, not the producer. The producer refers to the mare who gave birth to the foal, which in this case was Surplice."
