  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for The Million Pound Note are contradictory as they provide different initials for the writer's name. Statement 1 states that the screenwriter's initials were J.L., while statement 2 states that the screenwriter's initials were J.B. Priestley. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct without further information."
