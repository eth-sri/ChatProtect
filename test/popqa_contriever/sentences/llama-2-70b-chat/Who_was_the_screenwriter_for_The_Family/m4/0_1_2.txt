Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that Rouverol and her husband wrote the screenplay for \"The Family,\" while Statement 2 states that the screenplay was written by someone else and adapted into a film directed by Luc Besson. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
