  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"The Family\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that Rouverol and her husband wrote the screenplay for \"The Family\" since they had three screenplays accepted for filming by Hollywood studios. Statement 2 confirms that Rouverol and her husband did indeed have three screenplays accepted for filming by Hollywood studios, but it does not explicitly state that one of those screenplays was for \"The Family.\" Therefore, both statements provide information that is relevant to the question but do not contradict each other."
