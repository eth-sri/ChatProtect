Statement 1 acknowledges that the text does not provide explicit information about the screenwriter for \"The Family.\" Statement 2, however, provides additional information that is not explicitly stated in the text, but is still relevant to the question. It clarifies that Rouverol and her husband were involved in the writing of the script, along with friends from the Writers Guild of America. Therefore, both statements provide different levels of information about the screenwriter for \"The Family.\""
