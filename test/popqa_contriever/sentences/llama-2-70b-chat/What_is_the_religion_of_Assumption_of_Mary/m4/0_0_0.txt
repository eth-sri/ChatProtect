  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Assumption of Mary are not contradictory, but one is more specific than the other. Statement 1 correctly identifies that the belief in the Assumption of Mary is held by the Catholic Church, as well as the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Statement 2 is more specific and identifies Catholicism as the religion that specifically teaches the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary. Therefore, both statements are true, but statement 2 provides more specific information."
