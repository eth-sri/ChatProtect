  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Children's Book are not contradictory. While the first statement focuses on the historical fiction genre and the time period in which the novel is set, the second statement highlights the influence of a real-life children's writer on the story. This adds a layer of depth and insight into the world of children's literature, which is still consistent with the historical fiction genre. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide different perspectives on the genre of the novel."
