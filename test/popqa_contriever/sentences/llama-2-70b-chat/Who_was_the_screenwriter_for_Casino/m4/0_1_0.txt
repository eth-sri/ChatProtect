  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Casino\" are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Nicholas Pileggi was the screenwriter for the film and had already written the book \"Casino\" before collaborating with Martin Scorsese on the screenplay. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that Scorsese persuaded Pileggi to release the book after the film, while statement 2 does not mention this detail. However, this does not contradict the fact that Pileggi was the screenwriter for the film."
