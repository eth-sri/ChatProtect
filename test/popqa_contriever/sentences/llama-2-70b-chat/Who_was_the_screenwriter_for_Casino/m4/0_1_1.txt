  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both confirm that Nicholas Pileggi was the screenwriter for the film \"Casino\" and that he had written the book \"Casino: Love and Avarice in Las Vegas\" prior to the film's release. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that Pileggi wanted the book published before the film, while Scorsese convinced him to release it after the movie. Statement 2 conveys the same information, but in a slightly different way."
