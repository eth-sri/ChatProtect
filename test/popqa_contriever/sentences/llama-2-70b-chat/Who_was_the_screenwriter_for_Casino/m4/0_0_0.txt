  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Casino\" are not contradictory. Both statements mention Nicholas Pileggi as the screenwriter for the film, but statement 1 also includes Martin Scorsese as a co-screenwriter. Therefore, statement 1 provides more information about the screenwriting team for \"Casino\" than statement 2."
