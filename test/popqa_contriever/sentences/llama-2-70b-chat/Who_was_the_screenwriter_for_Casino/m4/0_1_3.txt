  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both confirm that Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese were the screenwriters for the film \"Casino\" (1995). The first statement provides additional information about Pileggi's desire to have his book published before the film, while the second statement emphasizes Scorsese's role in persuading Pileggi to release the book after the film. Together, the statements provide a more complete picture of the collaboration between Pileggi and Scorsese on the film adaptation of Pileggi's book."
