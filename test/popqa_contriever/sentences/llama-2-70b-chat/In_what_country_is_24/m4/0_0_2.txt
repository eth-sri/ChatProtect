While the first statement mentions that Africa 24 broadcasts in French to France, it also states that the network is available in Sub-Saharan Africa. The second statement simply reiterates that Africa 24 is available in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
