  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct in pointing out that the information provided in the beginning of the text is about a different author, Mark Forster, and not Steven Pressfield, who is the actual author of \"Do The Work\". Therefore, it contradicts the initial statement. Statement 2, on the other hand, provides additional information about the book \"Do The Work\" and is not contradictory to either the initial statement or Statement 1."
