  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Do The Work? are contradictory because they provide different names for the author of the book. Statement 1 claims that the author is Steven Pressfield, while Statement 2 claims that the author is Mark Forster. Therefore, they cannot both be true at the same time."
