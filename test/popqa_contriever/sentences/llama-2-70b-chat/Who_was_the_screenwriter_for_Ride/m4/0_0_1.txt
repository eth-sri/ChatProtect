  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Ride\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify Thomas Eidson as the author of the novel \"The Last Ride\" upon which the movie was based, and therefore the screenwriter for the film adaptation. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes that the movie was based on a novel by Eidson, while statement 1 focuses on his role as the screenwriter."
