  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Alexander are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about Achaeus, including his royal lineage as the second son of King Seleucus I Nicator and his first wife Apama I. Statement 2 simply identifies Achaeus as Alexander's father without providing any further details. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
