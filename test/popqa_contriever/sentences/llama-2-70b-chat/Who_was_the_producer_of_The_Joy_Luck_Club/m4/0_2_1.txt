While Arnold Leibovit was initially the producer at Carolco Pictures, the filmmakers turned down the contract due to a lack of creative control. Leibovit then shifted to Hollywood Pictures, where he continued to serve as producer and eventually secured financing for the film. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
