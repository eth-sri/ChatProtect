  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Joy Luck Club are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Arnold Leibovit was the president of Carolco Pictures, which initially supported the project but was turned down due to a lack of creative control. The second statement clarifies that the filmmakers later shifted to Hollywood Pictures, where Leibovit was also the president. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about Leibovit's involvement in the production of the film."
