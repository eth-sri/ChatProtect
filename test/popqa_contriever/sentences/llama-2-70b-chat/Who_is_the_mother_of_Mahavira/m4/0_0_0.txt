  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Mahavira are contradictory. Mahavira is not the same person as Gautama Buddha, as they are two different historical figures who founded different religions. While statement 1 correctly identifies the mother of Gautama Buddha as Maya Devi, statement 2 is incorrect in stating that Mahavira was born to Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b. Mahavira's mother was actually Trishala, who was a queen of the Ikshvaku dynasty."
