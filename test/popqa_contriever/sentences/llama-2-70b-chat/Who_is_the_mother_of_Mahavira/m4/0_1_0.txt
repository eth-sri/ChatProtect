  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Mahavira are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that Maya Devi was the wife of King Suddhodana and the queen of the Shakya Kingdom. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Suddhodana was the king of the Shakya clan. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the mother of Mahavira."
