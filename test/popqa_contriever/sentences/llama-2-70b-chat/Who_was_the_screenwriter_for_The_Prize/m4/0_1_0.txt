  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Prize are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ernest Lehman was a successful and experienced screenwriter who had worked on other notable films such as North by Northwest. The only difference is that statement 1 also includes West Side Story and The Sound of Music as examples of Lehman's work, while statement 2 mentions The Seven Year Itch instead. However, this difference in examples does not contradict the fact that Lehman was the screenwriter for The Prize."
