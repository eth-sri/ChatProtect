  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Prize? are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Ernest Lehman as the screenwriter for the 1963 film The Prize. However, the second statement is incorrect in stating that G\u00e9rard Oury was the screenwriter for the film. While Oury did appear in the film as one of the characters, he did not have a writing credit for the screenplay."
