  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory as they both provide the same answer to the prompt \"Who is the father of Apollo?\" by stating that it is Zeus. However, it is important to note that while Zeus is commonly recognized as Apollo's father in Greek mythology, there are also other versions of the myth that suggest different paternity."
