  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Michael Jackson's Ghosts are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Stephen King co-wrote the script with Mick Garris, while Statement 2 claims that Mick Garris was the sole screenwriter. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be accurate."
