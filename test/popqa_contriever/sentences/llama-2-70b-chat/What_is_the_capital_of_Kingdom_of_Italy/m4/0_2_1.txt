  "orig": "The capital remained in Turin until 1865, when it was moved to Florence, and later to Rome in 1871, where it remained until the end of the kingdom in 1946.",
  "alt": "It was moved to Rome in 1865, after the kingdom's expansion and consolidation.",
  "prefix": " The capital of the Kingdom of Italy was Turin (Torino), which was the capital of the House of Savoy, the ruling dynasty of the kingdom. Turin was chosen as the capital because it was the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, which was the predecessor state to the Kingdom of Italy, and it was the seat of the royal court and the government.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the capital was moved from Turin to Florence in 1865 and then to Rome in 1871, while Statement 2 claims that the capital was moved directly from Turin to Rome in 1865. These two statements cannot both be true, as they present different sequences of events."
