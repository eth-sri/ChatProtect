  "explanation": "The two statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are not contradictory. Both statements explain why Turin was chosen as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Statement 1 highlights the historical continuity between the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and the Kingdom of Italy, and how Turin was already established as the capital of the former. Statement 2 emphasizes the importance of Turin as the center of political and administrative power in the Kingdom of Italy. Together, these statements provide a comprehensive explanation of why Turin was chosen as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy."
