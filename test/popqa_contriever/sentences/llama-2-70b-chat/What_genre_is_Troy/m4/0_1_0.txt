  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Troy are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the series incorporates elements of historical fiction and features characters who are reincarnated into famous figures from different time periods. The only difference is that statement 2 also includes the mention of mythology, which is not explicitly mentioned in statement 1. However, this does not contradict the idea that the series is primarily a work of urban or contemporary fantasy."
