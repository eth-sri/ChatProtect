Both statements identify the series as belonging to the fantasy genre, specifically urban or contemporary fantasy, and mention that it is set in modern-day London with magical and supernatural elements. The only difference is that statement 2 is a more concise summary of the genre and setting, while statement 1 provides a bit more detail about the series and its themes."
