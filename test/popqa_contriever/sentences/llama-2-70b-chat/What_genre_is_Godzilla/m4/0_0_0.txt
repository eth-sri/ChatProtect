  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Godzilla are not contradictory. Statement 1 specifies that the franchise falls under the Kaiju genre, which is a subgenre of science fiction/fantasy that features giant monsters or supernatural creatures. Statement 2 broadens the genre to science fiction/monster movies, which includes other films with similar themes and elements. Both statements are accurate and provide different levels of specificity about the genre of Godzilla."
