  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Test are not contradictory. The first statement simply provides the author's name, while the second statement expands on the genre by describing it as a young adult science fiction novel with a focus on the protagonist's struggles with PTSD. Both statements are complementary and provide different pieces of information about the book's genre."
