  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that the passage does not provide any information about Cable's mother. The first statement emphasizes that the passage does not mention Cable's ancestry or parents, while the second statement specifically mentions that there is no information about Cable's mother. Together, they reinforce the fact that the passage is silent on the identity of Cable's mother."
