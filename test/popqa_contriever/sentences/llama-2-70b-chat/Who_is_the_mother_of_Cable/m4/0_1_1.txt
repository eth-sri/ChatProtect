  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Cable? are not contradictory. While the passage does not explicitly mention the mother of Cable, it does provide information about Cable's wife and daughter. The two statements provided are both accurate descriptions of the information provided in the passage. The fact that the mother of Cable is not mentioned does not contradict the information provided about Cable's wife and her secret."
