  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the passage does not explicitly mention the mother of Cable, it does provide information about Cable's wife and daughter, and the secret that the wife has kept hidden about the daughter's parentage. Therefore, statement 1 is accurate. Statement 2 further elaborates on the secret that Cable's wife has kept hidden, specifically that it pertains to the daughter's parentage. Both statements are consistent with the information provided in the passage."
