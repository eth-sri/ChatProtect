  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Ark\" by K\u014db\u014d Abe are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the novel can be classified as science fiction or speculative fiction due to its focus on a possible future event (the apocalypse) and the protagonist's attempt to save people from it. It also mentions elements of satire and black humor, which could be seen as subgenres within science fiction or speculative fiction. Statement 2 suggests that the novel can also be classified as post-apocalyptic fiction, which is a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on the aftermath of a catastrophic event. Both statements are valid and provide different perspectives on the genre of the novel."
