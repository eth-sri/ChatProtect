  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Horses? are contradictory. The first statement mentions two productions, \"Little House on the Prairie\" and \"Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion,\" that Ed Friendly produced, but \"Horses\" is not mentioned. The second statement claims that Ed Friendly was the producer of \"Horses.\" Therefore, it is unclear whether Ed Friendly produced \"Horses\" or not."
