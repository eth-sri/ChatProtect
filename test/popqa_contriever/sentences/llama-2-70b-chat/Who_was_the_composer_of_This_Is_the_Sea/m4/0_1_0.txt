Both statements mention Mike Scott as the lead composer of the film's soundtrack, with the second statement providing additional information about his role as the lead singer of The Waterboys. The first statement also mentions Brian Kennedy as a collaborator on the film's music, which does not contradict the fact that Mike Scott was the lead composer."
