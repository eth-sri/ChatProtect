  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Human Nature are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the band's music has evolved over time to include various genres, including pop and R&B, while also acknowledging their origins as a doo-wop group. The second statement simply identifies them as a pop boy band, which is consistent with their music being primarily pop-focused. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the genre of Human Nature."
