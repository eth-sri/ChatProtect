  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Human Nature are not contradictory. The first statement explains that while the group originated as a doo-wop group, their music has evolved to include various genres such as pop, R&B, and contemporary pop. The second statement simply provides information about the origin of the boy band, which is in Australia. Therefore, both statements provide different but complementary information about Human Nature and do not contradict each other."
