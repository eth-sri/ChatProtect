The first statement establishes that Hogan Sheffer was the screenwriter for \"The Young and the Restless\" during a specific time period, while the second statement explains that after Sheffer stepped down, Josh Griffith joined the show as a creative consultant and breakdown writer, and was later promoted to co-executive producer under Lynn Marie Latham. Therefore, the two statements provide additional information about the screenwriters for the show during different time periods."
