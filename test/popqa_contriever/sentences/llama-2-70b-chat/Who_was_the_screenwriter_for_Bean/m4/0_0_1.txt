The first statement lists the films that Henry Bean wrote the screenplays for, while the second statement suggests that there is a film called \"Bean\" and that Henry Bean was the screenwriter for it. However, there is no film called \"Bean\" and the prompt does not ask about a film called \"Bean\". Therefore, the second statement is incorrect and does not provide any relevant information to answer the prompt."
