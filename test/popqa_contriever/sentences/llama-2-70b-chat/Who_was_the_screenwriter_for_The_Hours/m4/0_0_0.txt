  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"The Hours\" are contradictory. The first statement is correct, as David Hare was the screenwriter for the film. The second statement, however, is incorrect, as it mentions Michael Cunningham, who is not the screenwriter for \"The Hours\". Cunningham is a novelist and screenwriter, but he did not work on \"The Hours\"."
