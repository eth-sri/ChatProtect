  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the screenwriter for Samson?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that Samson Raphaelson was a screenwriter, but it is not relevant to the prompt as it does not answer the question of whether he was the screenwriter for the film \"Samson\". Statement 2 directly answers the prompt by stating that Samson Raphaelson was the screenwriter for \"Samson\", but it is incorrect as there is no evidence that he wrote a screenplay for a film called \"Samson\"."
