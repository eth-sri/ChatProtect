  "explanation": "Yes, the two statements about \"In what country is Bouvet Island?\" are contradictory. The first statement clearly states that Bouvet Island is not part of any country and is not under the jurisdiction of any country. However, the second statement contradicts this by stating that Bouvet Island is an unincorporated territory of Norway, which implies that it is under the jurisdiction of Norway. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
