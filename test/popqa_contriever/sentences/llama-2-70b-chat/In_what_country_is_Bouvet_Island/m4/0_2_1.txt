  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory. Both statements explain that Bouvet Island is not part of any country or territory and is not under the jurisdiction of any country. The fact that it has its own country code top-level domain does not make it a sovereign state or a dependent territory of any country. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Bouvet Island is not part of any country."
