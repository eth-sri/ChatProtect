  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Bouvet Island?\" are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Bouvet Island is not part of any country and is not under the jurisdiction of any country, despite having its own country code top-level domain .bv. The second statement further emphasizes that the island has no permanent population or settlements, which reinforces the fact that it is not a sovereign state or a dependent territory of any country. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Bouvet Island is not part of any country."
