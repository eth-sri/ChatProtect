  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Skin are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Jerry Bruckheimer was the producer of Skin, and that the show was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Television and Hoosier Karma Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. The only difference between the two statements is the order in which the executive producers are listed."
