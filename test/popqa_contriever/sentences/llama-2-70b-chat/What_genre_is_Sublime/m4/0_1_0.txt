While the first statement mentions various genres that Sublime Frequencies releases, the second statement specifies that the label's focus is on obscure and lesser-known music from specific regional locales. This means that while the label may release music from various genres, their main focus is on discovering and sharing music from specific regions that may not be widely known or accessible to a global audience."
