  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Coral Records are not contradictory. The first statement specifies that the label primarily recorded pop and rock music, but also released jazz and swing music in the 1940s. The second statement simply reiterates that the label released jazz and swing music, which is consistent with the first statement."
