Statement 1 correctly identifies Melbourne as the capital of the City of Melbourne, while statement 2 incorrectly identifies Melbourne as the capital of Victoria. The capital of Victoria is actually Melbourne, but the prompt specifically asks about the capital of the City of Melbourne, which is a local government area within Victoria."
