  "explanation": "The statements about Sugar Ray's genre are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that the band is an alternative rock band, while the second statement explains how their sound has evolved over time, incorporating different elements and influences. The fact that they started out playing nu metal and later shifted to a more pop-influenced sound does not contradict their overall classification as an alternative rock band. In fact, it is not uncommon for bands within a particular genre to experiment with different styles and sounds over the course of their career."
