  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Sugar Ray are not contradictory. They both acknowledge the band's shift in sound from their earlier nu metal style to a more pop-influenced sound that incorporates elements of power pop and disco. The second statement further emphasizes the incorporation of pop and punk elements into their music. Both statements support the overall characterization of Sugar Ray as an alternative rock band, which encompasses a wide range of subgenres and influences."
