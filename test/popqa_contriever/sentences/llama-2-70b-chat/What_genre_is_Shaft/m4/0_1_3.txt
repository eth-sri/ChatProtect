  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the album falls under the subgenre of jazz known as soul jazz, which emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The only difference is that statement 1 provides more detail about the characteristics of soul jazz, while statement 2 simply mentions its emergence during that time period."
