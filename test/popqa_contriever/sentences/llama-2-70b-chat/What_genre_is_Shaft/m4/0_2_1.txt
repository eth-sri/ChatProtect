  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not necessarily contradictory, but they do differ in their emphasis on certain elements. Statement 1 highlights the orchestral and cinematic elements of the music, while also acknowledging the funk and R&B influences. Statement 2 emphasizes the funk, blues, and R&B elements, but does not mention the orchestral and cinematic aspects. Both statements agree that the music falls under the broader category of soul jazz. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different perspectives on the genre of Shaft."
