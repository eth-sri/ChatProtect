  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not necessarily contradictory, but they do offer different perspectives on the music. Statement 1 emphasizes the jazz influences in the music, while statement 2 emphasizes the soul and funk elements. It is possible for the music to contain both jazz and soul/funk elements, and for different listeners to hear those elements differently. Ultimately, the genre classification of Shaft may depend on individual interpretation and perspective."
