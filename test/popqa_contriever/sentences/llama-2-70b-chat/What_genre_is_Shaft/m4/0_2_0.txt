  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the album incorporates elements of funk and R&B, which are related genres. The first statement also adds that the album includes some orchestral and cinematic elements to match the film's theme, while the second statement simply repeats that the album features elements of funk and rhythm and blues. Overall, both statements support the idea that Shaft is primarily a soul jazz album with additional influences from funk and R&B."
