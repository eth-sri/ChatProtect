Statement 1 explains that the songwriting credit is given to the Lennon-McCartney partnership, while Statement 2 specifies that Paul McCartney is the composer. This is not contradictory as McCartney was one half of the Lennon-McCartney partnership and therefore can be considered the composer of the song."
