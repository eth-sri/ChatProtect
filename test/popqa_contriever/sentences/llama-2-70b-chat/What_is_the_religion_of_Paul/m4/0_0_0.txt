  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Paul are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Paul's religion was new and different from the religion of Jesus and James' Jesus Movement, as well as from Judaism. The only difference between the two statements is that one explicitly mentions James' Jesus Movement, while the other only mentions Jesus' teachings and Judaism in general. However, both statements convey the same idea that Paul's religion was distinct from the earlier Jewish and Jesus movements."
