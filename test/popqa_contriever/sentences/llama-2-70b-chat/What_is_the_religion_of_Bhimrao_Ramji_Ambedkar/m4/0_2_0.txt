  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he converted to Buddhism as a way to escape the caste system and social inequality prevalent in Hinduism. The first statement further explains that he found Buddhism's principles of equality and compassion to be in line with his own beliefs and values. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about Ambedkar's reasons for converting to Buddhism."
