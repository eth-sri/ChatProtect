  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Man of La Mancha are not contradictory. Both statements identify Dale Wasserman as the screenwriter for the film. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that it was the film adaptation of the musical, while statement 2 does not provide that additional context."
