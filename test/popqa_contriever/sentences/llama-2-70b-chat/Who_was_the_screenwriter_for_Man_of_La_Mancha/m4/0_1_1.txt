  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Man of La Mancha are not contradictory. Both statements identify Dale Wasserman as the screenwriter for the film and highlight his work on the stage musical adaptation of \"Man of La Mancha.\" The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions that Wasserman adapted the musical from the novel \"Don Quixote,\" while statement 2 refers to his work on both stage and screen adaptations of the musical."
