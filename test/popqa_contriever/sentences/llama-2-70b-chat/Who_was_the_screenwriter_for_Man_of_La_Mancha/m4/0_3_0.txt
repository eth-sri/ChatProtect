Both statements agree that Dale Wasserman was the screenwriter for the film and that it was released in 1972, starring Peter O'Toole as Don Quixote and Sophia Loren as Aldonza/Dulcinea. The only difference is that statement 2 omits the character's full name, but this does not contradict the information provided in statement 1."
