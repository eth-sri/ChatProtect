  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Ancestor? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the author is not explicitly stated in the given text, but it does provide information about the person who founded and edited the periodical, Walter Rye. The second statement adds to this information by stating that Arthur Charles Fox-Davies also edited the periodical. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the individuals involved in the creation of \"The Ancestor\"."
