  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Scream\" are not contradictory, but rather they offer different perspectives. The first statement suggests that the soundtrack's rock genre classification can be extended to the movie itself, while the second statement suggests that the horror genre is also applicable to the movie. It is possible for a movie to have multiple genre classifications, and in the case of \"Scream,\" it is often considered a horror film with elements of comedy and satire. Therefore, both statements can be true and complementary."
