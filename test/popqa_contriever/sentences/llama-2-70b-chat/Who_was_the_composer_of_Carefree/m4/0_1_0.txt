  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of Carefree are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Irving Berlin's involvement in the film's music. The first statement clarifies that Berlin wrote all the songs except for one, while the second statement adds that he wrote them all in a short period of time while on vacation. Together, these statements give a more complete picture of Berlin's contribution to the film's soundtrack."
