  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Sneakers are not contradictory. They both identify Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes as the screenwriters and mention that they first came up with the idea for the film while doing research for WarGames. The only difference is that the second statement clarifies that WarGames was their previous movie."
