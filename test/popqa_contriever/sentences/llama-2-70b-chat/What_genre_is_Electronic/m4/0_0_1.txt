  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Electronic?\" are contradictory. The first statement specifies that electronic rock is a subgenre that combines rock and electronic music, while the second statement suggests that electronic music as a whole combines rock and electronic elements. While there may be some overlap between the two genres, they are distinct and should not be used interchangeably."
