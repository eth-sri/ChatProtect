  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of The Good Earth are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Sidney Franklin was the director of the film, but also acknowledge that Victor Fleming and Gustav Machaty made uncredited contributions to the direction of the film. Statement 1 explicitly states that Franklin was the director and that Fleming and Machaty made uncredited contributions, while Statement 2 emphasizes the uncredited contributions made by Fleming and Machaty to the film's direction. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the directorship of The Good Earth."
