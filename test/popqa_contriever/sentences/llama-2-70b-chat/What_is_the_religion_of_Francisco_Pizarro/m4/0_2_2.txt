Both statements mention that Pizarro imposed Catholicism on the indigenous peoples he encountered during his conquests. The first statement adds that he destroyed their pagan temples and idols, while the second statement does not provide this detail. However, both statements agree that Pizarro was a Catholic Christian and that he actively promoted his religion during his expeditions."
