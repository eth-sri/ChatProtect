  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Francisco Pizarro are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that he was a Catholic Christian, while the second statement provides additional information about his expedition to Peru, including the fact that he was accompanied by a small group of Spanish soldiers and interpreters. The two statements do not contradict each other and can both be true at the same time."
