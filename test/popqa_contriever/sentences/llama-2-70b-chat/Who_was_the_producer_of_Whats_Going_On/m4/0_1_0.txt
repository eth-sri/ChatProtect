  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of \"What's Happening!\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the formation of TOY Productions after Bud Yorkin's split from Norman Lear and Tandem Productions, while Statement 2 simply lists the three individuals who formed TOY Productions. Both statements ultimately identify Bud Yorkin, Saul Turtletaub, and Bernie Orenstein as the producers of the show."
