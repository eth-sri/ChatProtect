  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they are not answering the prompt. The prompt asks about the director of Parents, but the text only mentions Michel Parent's positions and responsibilities in the fields of sports and leisure, as well as his involvement with the Montreal Catholic School Commission's Regional Advisory Committee of Parents. Therefore, the prompt remains unanswered."
