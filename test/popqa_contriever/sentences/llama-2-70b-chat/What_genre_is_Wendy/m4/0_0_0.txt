  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Wendy are not necessarily contradictory, as both horror and psychological thriller genres can overlap and share similar elements. However, they do offer slightly different interpretations of the character and the story she is in. The first statement emphasizes the slasher aspect of the horror genre, suggesting that Wendy may be a violent and dangerous character. The second statement focuses more on the psychological aspect of the story, suggesting that Wendy's fascination with knives may be a sign of deeper psychological issues. Overall, both statements suggest that Wendy is a character in a dark and unsettling story, but they offer slightly different perspectives on the genre of that story."
