The first statement clarifies that the text does not provide information about the author of \"The River.\" The second statement provides information about Carl Carmer's work in the Rivers of America Series, specifically his authorship of \"The Hudson River.\" However, it does not claim that Carmer is the author of \"The River.\" Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
