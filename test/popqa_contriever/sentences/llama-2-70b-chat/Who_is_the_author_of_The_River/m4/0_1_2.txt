Both statements agree that the text does not specify the author of \"The River.\" Statement 1 provides additional information about Carl Carmer's involvement in the Rivers of America Series, but it does not claim that he is the author of \"The River.\" Statement 2 simply reiterates that the text does not mention the author's name."
