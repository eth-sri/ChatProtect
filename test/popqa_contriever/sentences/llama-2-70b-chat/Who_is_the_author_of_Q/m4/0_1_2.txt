  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Q? are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the four Italian authors used the pen name Luther Blissett for the novel Q, but later changed their collective pen name to Wu Ming after the Luther Blissett Project ended in 1999. Statement 1 provides more detail about the Luther Blissett Project and their current pen name, while statement 2 focuses on the timing of the name change."
