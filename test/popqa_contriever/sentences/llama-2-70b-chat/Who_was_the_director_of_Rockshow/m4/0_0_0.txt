  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Rockshow? are contradictory. Statement 1 is incorrect as Mark Burnett was the executive producer of Rock Star, not the director. Statement 2 is partially correct as Clyde Lieberman was involved in the production of Rock Star, but he was the music producer, not the director. Therefore, the two statements provide conflicting information about the director of Rock Star."
