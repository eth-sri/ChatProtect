  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Star Trek: First Contact? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the screenwriters were Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, while statement 2 claims that the screenwriter was Michael Nemecek. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct."
