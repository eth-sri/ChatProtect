  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Pulp Fiction are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Quentin Tarantino was involved in writing the film's story, with the first statement also mentioning Roger Avary's contribution. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one specifically names Tarantino as a co-writer, while the first one uses the more general phrase \"the film's story.\" However, both statements ultimately convey the same information about Tarantino's involvement in the writing of Pulp Fiction."
