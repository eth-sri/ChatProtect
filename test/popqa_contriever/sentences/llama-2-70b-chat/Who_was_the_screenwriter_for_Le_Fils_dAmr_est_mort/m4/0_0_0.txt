  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Le Fils d'Amr est mort are contradictory. The text clearly states that Serge-Simon Held was a science fiction author and there is no mention of him being a screenwriter. Statement 2, on the other hand, claims that he was the screenwriter for the film. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
