  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Bat are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Crane Wilbur was the producer of The Bat and that he also wrote and directed a third adaptation of the film, which emphasized horror elements and featured the Bat ripping out the throats of his victims. The only difference between the two statements is that the first one provides more detail about the third adaptation, while the second one summarizes the same information."
