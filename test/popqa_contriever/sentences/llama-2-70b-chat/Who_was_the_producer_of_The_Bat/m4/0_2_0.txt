  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Bat are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Crane Wilbur was the producer of The Bat and that he also wrote and directed a third adaptation of the film, which emphasized horror elements and featured the Bat (played by Gavin Gordon) ripping out the throats of his victims. The only difference between the two statements is the wording used to describe the horror elements emphasized in the third adaptation."
