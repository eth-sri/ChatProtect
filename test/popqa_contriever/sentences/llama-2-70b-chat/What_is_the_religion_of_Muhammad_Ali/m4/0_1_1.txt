  "explanation": "The statements about Muhammad Ali's religion are not contradictory. The first statement provides a more detailed explanation of how his religious views evolved, including his introduction to the Nation of Islam and eventual conversion to Sunni Islam. The second statement simply states that he became a member of the Nation of Islam in 1962, which is a part of his religious journey but does not provide the full picture."
