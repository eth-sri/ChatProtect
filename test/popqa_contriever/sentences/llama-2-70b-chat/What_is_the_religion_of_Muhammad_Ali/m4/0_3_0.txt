  "explanation": "The statements about Muhammad Ali's religion are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ali was inspired by Sufism around 2005, which suggests that he incorporated Sufi beliefs into his existing religious views. The first statement provides more context by mentioning Ali's previous affiliations with the Nation of Islam and Sunni Islam, while the second statement simply highlights his interest in Sufism at a particular point in time. Overall, both statements contribute to a more complete understanding of Muhammad Ali's religious journey."
