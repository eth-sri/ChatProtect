  "explanation": "The statements about Muhammad Ali's religion are not contradictory. The first statement provides a more complete answer to the prompt by explaining that Ali's religious views changed over time, and he eventually converted to Sunni Islam after being a member of the Nation of Islam. The second statement simply states that he was introduced to the Nation of Islam in 1962, which is a true statement but does not provide a full answer to the prompt."
