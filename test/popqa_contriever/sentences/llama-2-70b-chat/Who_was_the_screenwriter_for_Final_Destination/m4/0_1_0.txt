  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Final Destination are not contradictory. Both statements mention that James Wong and Glen Morgan rewrote the original script, but they do not contradict each other. Statement 1 mentions that they rewrote the script to comply with their standards and incorporate their own vision, while Statement 2 mentions that they added more suspense and tension. These are not mutually exclusive actions and can both be true."
