  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Final Destination are not contradictory. The first statement simply states who the screenwriter was and that they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. The second statement elaborates on what those standards were, specifically mentioning a mix of horror and supernatural elements. Both statements provide additional information about the screenwriters and their approach to the film, but they do not contradict each other."
