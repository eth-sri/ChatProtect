  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Action? are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Shriver served as the director of Action Corps from its inception in 1971 until 1973, while statement 2 says that he served as the director from 1971 to 1976. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different time frames for Shriver's tenure as director."
