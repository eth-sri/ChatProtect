  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Gladiator are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Flor-Jon Films acquired the rights to the show from Carr in 1984 and licensed the unscripted rights to The Samuel Goldwyn Company (now part of MGM) in 1987. The second statement simply reiterates that the rights to the show were licensed to The Samuel Goldwyn Company (now part of MGM). Both statements are consistent with Flor-Jon Films being the producer of Gladiators."
