  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Gladiator are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Flor-Jon Films acquired the rights to the show and licensed the unscripted rights to The Samuel Goldwyn Company (now part of MGM) in 1987. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions that Carr sold his interest in a literary purchase to Flor-Jon Films in 1984, while statement 2 does not include this detail."
