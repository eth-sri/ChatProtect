  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Gladiator? are contradictory. Statement 1 attributes the production of Gladiators to Flor-Jon Films, while Statement 2 attributes it to John Ferraro. However, it is important to note that Ferraro was the driving force behind the American Gladiators brand and created the kids' version of the series, Gladiators 2000. It is possible that Flor-Jon Films was involved in the production of the original American Gladiators series, but Ferraro's involvement cannot be ignored."
