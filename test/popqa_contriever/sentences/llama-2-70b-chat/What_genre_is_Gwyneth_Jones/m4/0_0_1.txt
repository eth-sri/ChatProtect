  "explanation": "The statements about Gwyneth Jones' genre are not contradictory. Both statements describe her as a science fiction and fantasy writer who focuses on themes of gender and feminism, with a particular emphasis on feminist science fiction. The only difference is in the wording, with the first statement emphasizing the subgenre of feminist science fiction and the second statement emphasizing the exploration of gender and feminism in her works. Overall, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Jones' genre and themes."
