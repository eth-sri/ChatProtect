  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement provides information about the credits for The Room, including Wiseau as the producer and Lietzke and Caffrey as executive producers. The second statement simply confirms that Caffrey died in 1999, which is relevant to the discussion of his involvement in the film. The first statement also mentions Sestero's claim that Lietzke had no involvement in the film, which could be seen as contradicting her credit as an executive producer, but this is not a direct contradiction as it is based on a claim rather than a proven fact."
