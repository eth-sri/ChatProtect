Statement 1 indicates that the composer of \"I Miss You\" is not specified in the text, while Statement 2 identifies Joe Burke as the composer of \"I Miss You\". Therefore, one statement denies the existence of information about the composer of the song, while the other provides a specific answer to the question."
