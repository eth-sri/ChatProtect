Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that Lardner did not work on a film called \"Ring\" or that he did work on it but did not have a screenwriter for it. Statement 2 simply states that Lardner did not have a screenwriter for his film \"Ring\" because it is not mentioned in the given text. Both statements are plausible explanations for the lack of information about the screenwriter for \"Ring\" in the given text."
