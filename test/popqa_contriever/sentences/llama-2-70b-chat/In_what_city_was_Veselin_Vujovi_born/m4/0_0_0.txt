  "explanation": "The statements about where Veselin Vujovi\u0107 was born are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that he was born in Kotor, Montenegro, while statement 2 claims that he was born in Titograd, Yugoslavia. This is because Kotor is a city in Montenegro, while Titograd was the former name of the city of Podgorica, also located in Montenegro. Therefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
