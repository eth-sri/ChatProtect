Both statements mention that John Musker and Ron Clements were involved in expanding the story for The Mermaid, but neither statement specifies whether they were the sole screenwriters or if there were others involved. Therefore, the statements do not provide a clear answer to the question of who the screenwriter for The Mermaid was."
