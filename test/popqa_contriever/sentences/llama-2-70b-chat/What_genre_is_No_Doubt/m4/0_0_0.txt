Both statements agree that No Doubt's musical style is a blend of several genres, including ska punk, reggae fusion, punk rock, pop punk, new wave, alternative rock, and pop rock. The only difference is that the first statement specifically mentions the debut album blending ska punk, alternative rock, and new wave, while the second statement lists all the genres without specifying any particular album."
