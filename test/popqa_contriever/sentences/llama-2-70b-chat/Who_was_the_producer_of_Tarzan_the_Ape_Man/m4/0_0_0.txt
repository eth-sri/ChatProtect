  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Tarzan, the Ape Man are contradictory. The correct answer is that W. S. Van Dyke directed the film, but Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the production company behind it. The prompt specifically asks for the producer, and while Van Dyke was the director, he was not the producer. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect and statement 2 is partially correct."
