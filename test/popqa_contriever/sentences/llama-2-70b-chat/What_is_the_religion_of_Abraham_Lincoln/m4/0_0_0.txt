  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory. They both acknowledge the fact that there is a lack of consensus among historians and scholars regarding Lincoln's religious beliefs. While some people who knew him personally claimed that he believed in Christ, others who were close friends rejected this idea. Additionally, Lincoln himself issued a handbill to dispel accusations about his religious beliefs. Therefore, the conflicting accounts and interpretations make it difficult to determine with certainty what Lincoln's religion was."
