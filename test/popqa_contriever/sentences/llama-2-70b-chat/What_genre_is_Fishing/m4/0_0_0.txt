Both statements classify the album \"Night Fishing\" by Sakanaction as J-pop, but statement 1 provides additional information by specifying that it falls under the subgenre of indies rock. Therefore, statement 1 provides more detail and specificity than statement 2, but they both agree on the primary genre classification."
