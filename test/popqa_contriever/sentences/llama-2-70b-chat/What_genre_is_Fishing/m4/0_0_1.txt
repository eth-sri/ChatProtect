  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Fishing\" are contradictory. The first statement specifies that the album \"Night Fishing\" by Sakanaction is primarily classified as J-pop in the subgenre of indies rock, while the second statement simply states that the album is primarily J-pop. The first statement provides more specific information about the subgenre of J-pop that the album falls under, while the second statement is more general. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
