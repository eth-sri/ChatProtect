  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Watch? are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Raketa as the producer of the watch, while the second statement identifies Jean-Claude Quenet as a former director of Rolex's escapement department and of production at Franck Muller who joined the Russian factory in 2012. It is possible that Quenet played a role in the production of The Watch, but the first statement provides a more comprehensive answer to the prompt."
