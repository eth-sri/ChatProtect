  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Big Road? are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that George Bezzerides was one of the co-creators of \"The Big Valley\", while Statement 2 mentions that Georges Gonthier was one of the co-creators. The difference in the spelling of their first names suggests that they are two different people. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct and further research is needed to determine the actual screenwriter for \"The Big Road\"."
