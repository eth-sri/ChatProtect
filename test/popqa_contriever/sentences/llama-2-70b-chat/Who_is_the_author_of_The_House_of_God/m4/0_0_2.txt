  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of The House of God are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Samuel Shem is a pseudonym used by psychiatrist Stephen Bergman. Statement 1 provides the author's real name and the fact that he uses a pseudonym, while statement 2 only mentions the pseudonym. However, both statements are consistent in identifying the author of the book."
