They both state that Jubert worked on The Game, but Statement 2 specifically mentions that he worked as a narrative designer, while the text does not explicitly state his role as a screenwriter. Therefore, while Jubert may have contributed to the writing of The Game, the text does not provide enough information to confirm whether he was the sole screenwriter or not."
