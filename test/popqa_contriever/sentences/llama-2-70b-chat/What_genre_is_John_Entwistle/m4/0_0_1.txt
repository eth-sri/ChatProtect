Both statements identify him as a rock musician, with statement 1 specifying that he was a bass guitarist and singer in The Who, and statement 2 simply stating that he was known for his work in the rock genre. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about John Entwistle's musical career."
