  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the European Economic Community are not contradictory, but rather present different perspectives on the interpretation of the 1992 agreement on seats. Statement 1 explains that Brussels is considered the capital based on the interpretation of the agreement by Brussels itself. Statement 2 presents the view of British Conservatives who saw this interpretation as a Euro-federalist coup, indicating a political disagreement rather than a factual contradiction."
