  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the European Economic Community are not contradictory, but rather provide different perspectives on the 1992 agreement on seats. Statement 1 highlights how Brussels interpreted the agreement as declaring it as the capital, while Statement 2 emphasizes how the agreement declared Brussels as the seat of major EU institutions. Both statements acknowledge Brussels as the capital of the EEC, but offer different explanations for why it holds that status."
