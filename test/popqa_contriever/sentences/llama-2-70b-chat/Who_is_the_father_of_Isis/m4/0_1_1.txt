  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Isis are not contradictory. While the passage does not explicitly state who the father of Isis is, it does provide information about her roles as the wife of Osiris, the mother of Horus, and the consort of Horus the Elder. The second statement simply reiterates that Isis has a dual role, which is mentioned in the passage. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the information provided in the text."
