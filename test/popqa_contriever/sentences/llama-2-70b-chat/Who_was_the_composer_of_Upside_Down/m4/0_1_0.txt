While the composer is not explicitly mentioned in the text, it is stated that their first single, \"Change Your Mind\", was written for Bad Boys Inc. and was written by World Records, the independent record label that developed Upside Down. Therefore, it can be inferred that the composer of Upside Down's music is not mentioned because they did not write their own music, but rather had songs written for them by their record label."
