  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of The Whole Family are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies that the novel was a collaboration of twelve different authors, while listing all twelve authors who contributed to the book. The second statement provides additional information about the roles of William Dean Howells and Elizabeth Jordan in conceiving and directing the project, as well as their contributions as authors. Both statements are accurate and complement each other."
