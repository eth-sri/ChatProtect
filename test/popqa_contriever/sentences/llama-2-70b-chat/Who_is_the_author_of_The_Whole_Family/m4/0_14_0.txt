  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of The Whole Family are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies that the novel was written by twelve different authors, including William Dean Howells and Elizabeth Jordan, who both played a role in conceiving and directing the project. The second statement specifically identifies Howells as the one who conceived the novel, which is also true. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the authorship of The Whole Family."
