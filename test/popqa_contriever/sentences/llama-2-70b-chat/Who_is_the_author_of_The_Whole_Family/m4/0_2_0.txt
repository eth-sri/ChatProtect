  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of The Whole Family are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the novel was written by twelve authors, without specifying who they are. The second statement provides a list of two of the twelve authors, including William Dean Howells and Elizabeth Jordan, as well as noting that the other ten authors were also notable writers of the time. Therefore, the second statement provides additional information about the authors without contradicting the first statement."
