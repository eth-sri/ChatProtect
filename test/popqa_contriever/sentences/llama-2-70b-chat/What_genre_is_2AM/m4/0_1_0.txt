  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 2AM are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that 2AM's music may include a variety of genres, including pop, R&B, and hip-hop. The only difference is that statement 1 includes dance as a possible genre, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the overall idea that 2AM's music is not limited to a single genre."
