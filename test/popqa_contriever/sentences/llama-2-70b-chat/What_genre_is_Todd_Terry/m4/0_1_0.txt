  "explanation": "The statements about Todd Terry's genre are not necessarily contradictory, but rather offer different perspectives. Statement 1 suggests that Terry's music is a fusion of various styles, which is a common characteristic of house music. Statement 2 narrows down his genre to a specific subgenre of house music, deep house. While the two statements may differ in their level of specificity, they both ultimately classify Todd Terry's music as falling within the broader category of house music."
