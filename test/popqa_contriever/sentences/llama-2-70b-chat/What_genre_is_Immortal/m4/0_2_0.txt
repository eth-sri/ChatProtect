  "explanation": "The statements about Immortal's genre are not contradictory. Both statements mention the band's experimentation with a fusion of black metal and German thrash metal, which resulted in a unique sound that characterizes their later works. The first statement provides additional context by mentioning that their early work was rooted in traditional black metal style before they evolved. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a comprehensive understanding of Immortal's genre."
