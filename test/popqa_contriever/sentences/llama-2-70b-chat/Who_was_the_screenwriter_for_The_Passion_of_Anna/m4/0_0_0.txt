  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Passion of Anna are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Ingmar Bergman was the screenwriter and director of the film. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentences. Statement 1 explicitly mentions that Bergman was the screenwriter, while Statement 2 combines both the roles of writing and directing into one sentence."
