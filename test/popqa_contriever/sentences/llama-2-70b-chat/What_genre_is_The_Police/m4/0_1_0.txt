  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that The Police are often associated with punk rock, but also recognizes that their sound expanded beyond that genre to include other styles. The second statement further emphasizes that while they are associated with punk rock, their sound was not strictly defined by it. Both statements ultimately support the idea that The Police's genre is a combination of new wave, post-punk, and reggae-fusion, with influences from other genres as well."
