  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Police are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that while the band is often associated with punk rock, their sound expanded beyond it to include other genres. The second statement further elaborates on this by specifying that their incorporation of reggae, pop, and new wave elements was in addition to their punk rock roots. Both statements ultimately support the idea that The Police's genre is a combination of new wave and post-punk with influences from other genres."
