  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Police are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that while the band is often associated with punk rock, their sound expanded beyond that genre to incorporate a range of other styles and influences, including reggae, pop, and new wave. The first statement emphasizes that their sound \"incorporated\" these other styles, while the second statement emphasizes that their sound \"expanded beyond\" the punk rock genre to include these other elements. However, both statements ultimately agree that The Police's primary genres are new wave and post-punk, with elements of reggae-fusion and pop/rock."
