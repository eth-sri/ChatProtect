  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Orpheus Descending\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both Veena Sud and Nic Pizzolatto as co-writers, while Statement 2 only mentions Veena Sud as the screenwriter. This suggests that Sud was the primary screenwriter, but Pizzolatto may have contributed to the episode in some capacity. Therefore, both statements can be true without contradicting each other."
