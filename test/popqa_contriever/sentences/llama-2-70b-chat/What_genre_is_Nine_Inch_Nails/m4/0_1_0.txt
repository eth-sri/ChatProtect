  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Nine Inch Nails are not contradictory. The first statement describes the band's sound and influences, while the second statement describes their live performances and visual effects. While the band's sound may be considered avant-garde and experimental, their live shows are known for their intense and immersive experience.
