  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Nine Inch Nails are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the band's sound incorporates elements of industrial rock and electronic music, but the second statement adds that their sound also includes avant-garde influences. The first statement further expands on the band's sound by including techno and ambient music as additional elements. Overall, both statements provide a similar description of Nine Inch Nails' genre, with the second statement offering a slightly more specific characterization."
