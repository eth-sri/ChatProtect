  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Stari Ras the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Stari Ras was one of the first capitals of the medieval Serbian state of Ra\u0161ka, implying that there were other capitals as well. Statement 2, on the other hand, states that Stari Ras was the capital of the medieval Serbian state of Ra\u0161ka, indicating that at some point in time, Stari Ras held the primary position as the capital. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
