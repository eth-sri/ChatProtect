They both provide additional information about the composer Marius-Fran\u00e7ois Gaillard, specifically his age at the time he was commissioned to create the score for El Dorado. The first statement uses the word \"create\" while the second statement uses the word \"compose\", but they are synonyms and do not change the meaning of the sentence."
