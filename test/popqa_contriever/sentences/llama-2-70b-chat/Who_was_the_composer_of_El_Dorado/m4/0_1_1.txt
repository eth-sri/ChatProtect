  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of El Dorado are not contradictory. The first statement provides the name of the composer, Marius-Fran\u00e7ois Gaillard, and mentions his age at the time of the commission. The second statement provides additional information about who commissioned Gaillard, which was the film's director, Jean-Luc Godard. Both statements provide different but complementary information about the composer and his involvement in the film."
