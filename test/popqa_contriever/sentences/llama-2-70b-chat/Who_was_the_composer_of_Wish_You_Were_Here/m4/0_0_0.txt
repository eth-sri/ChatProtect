  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Wish You Were Here\" are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that David Gilmour and Roger Waters worked together to write the music for the song. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence, with one using the word \"collaborated\" and the other using the word \"composed.\" However, both statements attribute the creation of the music to both Gilmour and Waters."
