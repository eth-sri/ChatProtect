  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Safe? are contradictory. The first statement mentions Marti Pagliarulo Feely as the executive director for the first six years of Safe Kids, while the second statement identifies Marti Shepherd as the director of Safe Kids Worldwide. These are two different names, and therefore, the statements cannot refer to the same person."
