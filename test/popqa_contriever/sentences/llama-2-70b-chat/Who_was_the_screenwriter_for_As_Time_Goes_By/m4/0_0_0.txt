  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they do not answer the prompt about the screenwriter for \"As Time Goes By.\" The prompt is asking about the author of the novel \"As Time Goes By,\" which is a prequel/sequel to the film \"Casablanca.\" Therefore, the correct answer to the prompt is that the author of \"As Time Goes By\" is Michael Walsh, not Julius J. Epstein or any of the other screenwriters for the film."
