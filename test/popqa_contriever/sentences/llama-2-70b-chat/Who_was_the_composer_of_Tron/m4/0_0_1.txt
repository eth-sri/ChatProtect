  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of Tron are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Osmond Kendal developed the Composer-Tron, which was the first analogue synthesis and composition instrument of its kind. The first statement also adds that Kendal developed it for the Canadian Marconi Company in 1953, while the second statement simply states that Kendal developed it. Therefore, the statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
