  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Iphicles are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that Amphitryon is the father of Iphicles. Statement 1 provides additional information about Amphitryon being the husband of Alcmene, Iphicles' mother, but it does not contradict the information in statement 2. Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other."
