  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Muhammad Ali are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Ali as a Muslim, while the second statement provides further detail by specifying that he was a Sunni Muslim. It is possible for someone to be both a Muslim and a Sunni Muslim, as Sunni Islam is one of the major branches of Islam. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
