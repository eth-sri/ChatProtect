  "explanation": "The statements about Muhammad Ali's religion are not contradictory. They both state that he was a Muslim, but specify that he was initially a member of the Nation of Islam and later converted to Sunni Islam after the death of the Nation's leader. The second statement provides more detail about the timing of his conversion. Overall, both statements are consistent with each other and support the conclusion that Muhammad Ali was a Muslim who underwent a religious transformation during his life."
