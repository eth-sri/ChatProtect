  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Verbandsgemeinde Loreley are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde is located in Sankt Goarshausen, but it does not necessarily mean that it is the official capital. The second statement explains that Verbandsgemeinde Loreley is a collective municipality made up of several local municipalities, and as such, there is no official capital designated for it. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the administrative structure of Verbandsgemeinde Loreley."
