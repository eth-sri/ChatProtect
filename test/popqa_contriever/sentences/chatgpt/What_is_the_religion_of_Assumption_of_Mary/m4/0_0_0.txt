Both statements convey the same idea that the Assumption of Mary is a religious doctrine and belief held by the Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy. The first statement uses the word \"doctrine and belief\" while the second statement uses the phrase \"religious doctrine.\" However, both convey the same meaning that the Assumption of Mary is a religious belief."
