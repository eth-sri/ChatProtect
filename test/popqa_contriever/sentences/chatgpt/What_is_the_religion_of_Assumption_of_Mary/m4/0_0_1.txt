Both statements convey the same information, stating that the belief in the Assumption of Mary is held by the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodox Church. The only difference is the use of the word \"Church\" versus \"Orthodoxy,\" which does not change the meaning of the statements."
