While the text does not explicitly state who the producer of Cinema is, it does mention that Cinema V entered film production in a joint venture with Palevsky, and later Palevsky went into independent production with Peter Bart. Additionally, statement 2 clarifies that the joint venture between Cinema V and Palevsky was called Cinema X. Therefore, it can be inferred that Palevsky was involved in the production of Cinema, either as a joint venture partner or as an independent producer."
