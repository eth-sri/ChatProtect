  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that there is no director associated with \"Beautiful Ohio\" as it is a song and not a production that requires a director. The first statement emphasizes that the term \"director\" is not applicable to a song, while the second statement specifically mentions that the song is the official song of Ohio and therefore does not have a director."
