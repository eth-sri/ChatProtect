  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. The first statement provides a broader context by stating that Jesus' religion is seen as a continuation of the monotheistic faiths that came before him, while the second statement specifically identifies Jesus as a prophet in Islam. Both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Jesus was a messenger of God who brought a new scripture, the Gospel, to guide the Children of Israel. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
