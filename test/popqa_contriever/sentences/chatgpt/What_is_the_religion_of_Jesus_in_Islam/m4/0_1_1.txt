  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God who came to guide the Children of Israel and teach them to submit to God and follow His commandments. The religion of Jesus in Islam is seen as a continuation of the monotheistic faiths that came before him, and his message is one of worshiping God alone. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide a comprehensive understanding of the religion of Jesus in Islam."
