  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that the religion of Jesus in Islam is based on submission to the one true God, which is the same message that all prophets and messengers before him preached. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the mention of monotheistic faiths that came before Jesus, while statement 2 does not. However, both statements convey the same idea that the religion of Jesus in Islam is a continuation of the message of all prophets and messengers before him."
