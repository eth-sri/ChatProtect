  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the central belief in Islam that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent to guide people to submit to the will of God. The first statement highlights the continuity of Jesus' religion with the monotheistic faiths that came before him, while the second statement emphasizes the commonality of all prophets in their message of submission to God. Both statements are consistent with Islamic beliefs about Jesus and his role as a prophet and messenger of God."
