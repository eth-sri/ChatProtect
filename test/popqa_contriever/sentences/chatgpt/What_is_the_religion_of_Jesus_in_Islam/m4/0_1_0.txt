  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and that his message was one of submission to God. The second statement adds that Jesus brought a new scripture, the Gospel, which is referred to as the Injil in Islam. These statements are complementary and provide a more complete understanding of the role of Jesus in Islam."
