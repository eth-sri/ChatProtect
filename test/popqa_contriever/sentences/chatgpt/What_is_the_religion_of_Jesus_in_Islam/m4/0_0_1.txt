  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Jesus' religion is seen as a continuation of the monotheistic faiths that came before him, including Judaism and Christianity. The second statement further specifies that Jesus' religion is part of the Abrahamic tradition, which includes Judaism and Christianity. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the religion of Jesus in Islam."
