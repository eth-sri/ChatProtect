Redfield as the current Director of the CDC, while Statement 2 identifies Dr. Rochelle Walensky as the current Director of the CDC. Neither statement mentions any connection to a film or TV show called \"Virus Director.\" Therefore, the two statements provide conflicting information about the current Director of the CDC."
