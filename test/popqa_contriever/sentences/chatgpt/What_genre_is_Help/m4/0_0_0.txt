  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Help are not contradictory, but they are repetitive. Both statements identify the film as a period drama, which is a genre that typically involves historical settings and focuses on character development and interpersonal relationships. Therefore, the two statements convey the same information without adding any new insights or perspectives."
