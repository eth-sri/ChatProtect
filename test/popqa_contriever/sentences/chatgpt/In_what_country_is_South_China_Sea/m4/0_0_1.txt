  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the South China Sea is not located within a single country, it is located between several sovereign states, as mentioned in Statement 1. Statement 2 provides additional geographical context by specifying that the disputed area is located in the western Pacific Ocean, south of China and east of Vietnam. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the location of the South China Sea."
