Statement 1 acknowledges that there are different mythological traditions that mention different fathers for the Charites, while statement 2 specifically mentions one of those traditions where they are said to be the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome. Therefore, statement 2 is a subset of statement 1 and does not contradict it."
