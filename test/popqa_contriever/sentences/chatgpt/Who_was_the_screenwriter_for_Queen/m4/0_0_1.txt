While Statement 1 acknowledges that the article does not specify which \"Queen\" is being referred to, Statement 2 clarifies that \"Queen\" is a film adaptation of Walter Tevis's novel of the same name. Therefore, both statements provide different pieces of information without contradicting each other."
