The first statement acknowledges that there are two works mentioned in the passage that could be referred to as \"The Detective\" and specifies that if we consider the 2005 film, David S. Cass Sr. was the director, not the producer. The second statement clarifies that the novel titled \"Detective\" was written by Arthur Hailey and would not have had a producer. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the works mentioned in the passage and do not contradict each other."
