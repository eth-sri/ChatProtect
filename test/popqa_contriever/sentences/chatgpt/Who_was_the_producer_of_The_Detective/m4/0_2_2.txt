The first statement refers to the producer of the 2005 film adaptation of The Detective, while the second statement discusses the source material for the film, which is the novel written by Arthur Hailey. As the novel is not a film, it would not have had a producer. Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory and provide different information about different aspects of The Detective."
