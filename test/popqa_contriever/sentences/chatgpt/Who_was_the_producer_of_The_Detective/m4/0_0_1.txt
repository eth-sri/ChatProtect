  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Detective? are not contradictory. They simply provide additional information about the different works that could be referred to as \"The Detective.\" The first statement acknowledges the ambiguity of the title, while the second statement clarifies that there are two works that could be referred to in relation to The Detective. Neither statement directly addresses the producer of the 1968 film adaptation of The Detective, which was directed by Gordon Douglas and produced by Aaron Rosenberg."
