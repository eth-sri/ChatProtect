  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Apostrophes are not contradictory. Both statements mention Bernard Pivot as the creator of the show, but statement 1 specifically states that he was also the producer, while statement 2 focuses on his role as the host of the show. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
