  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"The Good News\" are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Jonathan Abrahams was one of the screenwriters for the episode, and that he worked with Matthew Weiner. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes that Weiner was also a screenwriter, while statement 2 focuses solely on Abrahams' role."
