  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"The Bells\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the composer is not specified in the given text, while statement 2 identifies Sergei Rachmaninoff as the composer. Therefore, one statement denies the existence of information while the other provides a specific answer, creating a contradiction."
