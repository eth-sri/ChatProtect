  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Glas? are not contradictory. They both provide the same information that Glas was established by Natasha Perova in 1991. The first statement clarifies that Glas is not the work of a single author, but rather a publishing house. The second statement simply states the fact of who established the publishing house."
