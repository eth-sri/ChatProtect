Statement 1 clarifies that Laura Jones is the screenwriter, not the subject, and therefore the question needs to be rephrased. Statement 2 acknowledges that the question is incomplete and asks for more context or clarification. Both statements aim to provide helpful feedback to the person asking the question."
