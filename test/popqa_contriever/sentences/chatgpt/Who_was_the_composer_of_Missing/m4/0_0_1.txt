  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Missing? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Martin Ellerby is the composer of \"One of the Missing \u2013 for those lost in Iraq,\" while Statement 2 claims that Robert J. Bradshaw Cooper is the composer of the same work. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct."
