  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Tokugawa Shogunate are not contradictory. Statement 1 clarifies that Edo was the center of the Tokugawa Shogunate's ruling, but it was not the capital of Japan. Statement 2 simply reiterates that Tokyo (formerly Edo) was not the capital of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Both statements are consistent with the historical fact that the capital of Japan during the Tokugawa Shogunate was Kyoto, while Edo served as the center of political power."
