The first statement clarifies that Edo was the center of Tokugawa's ruling, but it was not the capital of Japan. The second statement further emphasizes that Edo was not the capital of Japan, despite its significance during the Edo period. Both statements provide accurate information about the relationship between Edo and the capital of Japan during the Tokugawa Shogunate."
