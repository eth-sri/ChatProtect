Statement 1 acknowledges that Managua is currently the capital of Nicaragua, but also recognizes the historical significance of Le\u00f3n as a former capital. Statement 2 provides a more specific timeline of when Le\u00f3n was the capital and when it was replaced by Managua. Both statements are accurate and provide different perspectives on the history of Nicaragua's capital."
