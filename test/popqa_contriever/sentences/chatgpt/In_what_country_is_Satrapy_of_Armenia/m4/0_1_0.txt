  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Satrapy of Armenia?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the historical region of Armenia is located in modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran, while Statement 2 states that it is located in modern-day Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. The order of the countries is different in each statement, which creates a contradiction. Additionally, Statement 2 specifically mentions Turkey as the location of the historical region of Armenia, while Statement 1 does not."
