  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Kingdom of England are not contradictory. Statement 1 is a general statement that identifies London as the capital of the Kingdom of England. Statement 2 provides additional historical context by stating that Winchester was the capital before it was moved to London in the 12th and 13th centuries. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
