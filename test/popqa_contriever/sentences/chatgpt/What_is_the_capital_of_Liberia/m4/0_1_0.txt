  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is the capital of Liberia?\" are contradictory. The first statement states that the capital of Liberia is Monrovia, which is true. However, the second statement clarifies that the city of Liberia mentioned in the context of the text is not the capital of Liberia, but rather a city in Costa Rica. Therefore, the two statements refer to different places and are not related to each other."
