  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of The Anniversary are not contradictory, but they do provide different information. The first statement establishes that Alvin Rakoff was the original director, but was replaced after a week of filming. The second statement adds that Rakoff clashed with Bette Davis and was replaced by an unknown director. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
