  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Police are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides an overall description of the band's genre, which includes new wave, post-punk, and reggae-fusion elements. Statement 2 simply emphasizes the fact that many of their songs fall specifically within the reggae-fusion genre. Both statements are consistent with the idea that The Police incorporated a variety of genres into their music."
