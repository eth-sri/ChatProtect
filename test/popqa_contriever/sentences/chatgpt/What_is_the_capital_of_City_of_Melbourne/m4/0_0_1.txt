  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory as they both clarify that the City of Melbourne is not a capital city, but rather a local government area within the state of Victoria, Australia. The prompt does not ask for the capital of the City of Melbourne, but rather for the name of the city itself. Therefore, the statements provide additional information about the nature of the City of Melbourne as a local government area within the state of Victoria."
