  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is the capital of City of Melbourne?\" are contradictory. Statement 2 claims that the City of Melbourne does not have a capital, while Statement 1 implies that the City of Melbourne is not a state or territory and therefore does not have a capital in the traditional sense. However, the City of Melbourne is often referred to as the capital city of the state of Victoria, which could be considered a type of capital. Therefore, while the City of Melbourne may not have a capital in the same way that a state or territory does, it can still be considered a capital city."
