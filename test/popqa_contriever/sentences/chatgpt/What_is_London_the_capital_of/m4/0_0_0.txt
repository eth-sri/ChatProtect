  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is London the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that London is the capital of both England and the United Kingdom. The only difference is that the second statement specifies that London is a city, which is already implied in the first statement. Therefore, both statements are consistent and accurate."
