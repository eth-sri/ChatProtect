  "explanation": "The statements about the sport played by the 1889 College Football All-America Team are not contradictory. Both statements refer to the same sport, which is American football. The use of the term \"football\" alone could potentially be ambiguous, as it could refer to association football (soccer) in some countries. However, the addition of \"American\" clarifies that the sport being referred to is American football."
