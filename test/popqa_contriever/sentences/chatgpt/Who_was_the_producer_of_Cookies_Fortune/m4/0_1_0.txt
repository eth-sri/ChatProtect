  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Cookie's Fortune? are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the 1999 film Cookie's Fortune was produced by Scott Rudin and directed by Robert Altman, while Statement 2 states that the 1999 film Cookie's Fortune was produced by Robert Altman. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. One of them must be incorrect."
