  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Duchy of Amalfi are not contradictory. While statement 1 directly states that the city of Amalfi was the capital, statement 2 provides additional information that the Duchy of Amalfi did not have a designated capital, but the city of Amalfi served as its political and cultural center. Therefore, both statements are true and complement each other."
