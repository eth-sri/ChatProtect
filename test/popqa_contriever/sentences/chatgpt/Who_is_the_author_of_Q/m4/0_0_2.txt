  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Q are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Luther Blissett was a shared pseudonym used by four Italian authors who were part of the \"Luther Blissett Project\". The only difference is that statement 1 explicitly states that Luther Blissett was a \"nom de plume\" for the authors, while statement 2 implies this by stating that the group wrote under a shared pseudonym."
