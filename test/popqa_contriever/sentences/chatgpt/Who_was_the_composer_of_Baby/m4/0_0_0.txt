Statement 1 claims that Justin Bieber is the composer of the song \"Baby,\" while Statement 2 suggests that there is not enough information to determine which song titled \"Baby\" is being referred to. Therefore, Statement 1 assumes that the song in question is the one by Justin Bieber, while Statement 2 questions the identity of the song."
