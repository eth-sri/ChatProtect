  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Bertrand Russell are contradictory. Statement 1 identifies the mother as Katherine, Countess Russell, while Statement 2 identifies her as Katherine, daughter of John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley. These cannot both be true, as a person cannot be both a countess and a daughter of a baron. Therefore, one of the statements must be incorrect."
