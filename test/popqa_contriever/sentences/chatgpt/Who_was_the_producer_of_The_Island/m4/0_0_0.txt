  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of \"The Island\" are not contradictory. However, it is important to note that there is no known production or show called \"The Island\". The assumption is made that the prompt is referring to \"Gilligan's Island\", which is clarified in statement 2. Statement 1 correctly identifies the character Harold Hecuba as the producer in the specific episode \"The Producer\" of \"Gilligan's Island\", while statement 2 provides additional information about the actor who played the character."
