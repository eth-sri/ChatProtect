  "explanation": "The two statements about \"What is Teramo the capital of?\" are not contradictory. They both provide the same information, stating that Teramo is the capital of the province of Teramo in the Abruzzo region of Italy. The only difference is the order of the words \"Italian region of Abruzzo\" and \"Abruzzo region of Italy\", which does not change the meaning of the statements."
