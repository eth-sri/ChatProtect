  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Jazz? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author of \"Jazz\" is Gary Giddins, while Statement 2 argues that the prompt is unclear as there are multiple books titled \"Jazz\" by different authors. While it is possible that Gary Giddins authored a book titled \"Jazz,\" Statement 2 suggests that there is not enough information to confirm this. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
