  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Frederick William IV of Prussia are not contradictory. The first statement clearly states that he was a member of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia, which is a United Protestant denomination that includes both Reformed and Lutheran believers. The second statement simply reiterates this fact and provides additional information about the denomination itself. Therefore, both statements are consistent and support the conclusion that Frederick William IV was a Lutheran member of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia."
