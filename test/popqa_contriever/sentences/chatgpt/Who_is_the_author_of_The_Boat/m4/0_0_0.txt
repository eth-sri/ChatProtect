  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Boat? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same message that the AI language model does not have enough information to accurately determine the author of The Boat based on the given prompt. While statement 1 explicitly mentions insufficient information, statement 2 explains that the book title alone is not specific enough to provide the necessary information. Therefore, both statements complement each other in conveying the same message."
