  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Breath are not contradictory. They both provide the same information, with the only difference being the inclusion of the word \"film\" in the second statement. This does not change the meaning of the sentence and is simply a more specific way of referring to the adaptation of the novel."
