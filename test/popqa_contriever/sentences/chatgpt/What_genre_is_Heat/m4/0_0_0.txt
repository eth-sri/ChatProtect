  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Heat are not contradictory. The first statement specifies that Heat is both a sports fiction novel and a young adult novel, while the second statement only identifies it as a young adult novel. Therefore, the second statement is a subset of the first statement, and both statements can be true at the same time."
