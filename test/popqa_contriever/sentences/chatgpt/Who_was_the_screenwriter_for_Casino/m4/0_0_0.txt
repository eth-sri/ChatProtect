  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Casino are not contradictory. Both statements mention Nicholas Pileggi as the screenwriter for Casino, but statement 1 adds that Martin Scorsese also worked on the screenplay. Therefore, statement 1 provides more information than statement 2, but they both agree on the main point."
