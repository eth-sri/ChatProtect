  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Pi? are not contradictory, but they are not relevant to the prompt. The prompt asks about the director of Pi, which is not an organization or institution, but rather a concept or term that can refer to either the mathematical constant or the film. Therefore, the correct answer to the prompt is that there is no director of Pi. The two statements provided are true, but they do not address the prompt directly and do not contradict each other."
