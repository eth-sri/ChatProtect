  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Pi is not an organization or institution that would have a director. The second statement specifies that Larry Shaw was the founder of Pi Day, which is a celebration of the mathematical constant pi, and not a director of a film or organization. Therefore, both statements provide different but accurate information about the question of who was the director of Pi."
