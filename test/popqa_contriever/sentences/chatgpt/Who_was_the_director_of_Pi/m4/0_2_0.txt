  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Pi? are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about Larry Shaw, who was the founder of Pi Day, but they do not contradict each other or the fact that Pi itself does not have a director. The first statement emphasizes Shaw's diverse background, while the second statement adds that he was American."
