  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Mars\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the genre of the song is not explicitly stated, while the second statement provides additional information about the album as a whole, indicating that it features other tracks classified as electronica. Both statements suggest that \"Mars\" is likely to be classified as electronica, but the first statement acknowledges the lack of explicit information about the genre of the song. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
