  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of On the Job are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Erik Matti was the director, while statement 2 claims that Ishmael Bernal was the director. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct. In fact, Ishmael Bernal was the director of On the Job."
