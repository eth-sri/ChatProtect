  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Regeneration are not contradictory, as war fiction and historical fiction are not mutually exclusive genres. Regeneration can be classified as both a war fiction and a historical fiction novel, as it is set during World War I and deals with the psychological effects of the war on soldiers and society."
