  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the prompt asks about the author of The Best Man, the text clarifies that it is a film, not a book. The second statement further specifies that the film was directed by Stefan Schwartz. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the film and its director, without contradicting each other."
