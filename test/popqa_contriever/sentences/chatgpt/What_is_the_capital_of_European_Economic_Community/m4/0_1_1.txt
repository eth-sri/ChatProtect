  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the EEC no longer exists and was replaced by the EU in 1993. The second statement clarifies that even though the EU exists now, it has never officially declared a capital city. The EEC, on the other hand, did not have an official capital as it was a community of member states rather than a distinct political entity. Therefore, both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
