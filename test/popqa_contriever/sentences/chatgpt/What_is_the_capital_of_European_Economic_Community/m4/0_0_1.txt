  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement provides background information that the European Economic Community (EEC) no longer exists and was replaced by the European Union (EU) in 1993. The second statement simply reiterates this fact. Neither statement directly addresses the question of what the capital of the EEC was, but the text following the statements suggests that Brussels is considered by many to be the capital of the EU, which includes the former EEC member states."
