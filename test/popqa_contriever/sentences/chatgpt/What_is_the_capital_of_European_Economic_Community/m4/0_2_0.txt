  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Statement 2 confirms that the headquarters of the EEC were located in Brussels, Belgium, which implies that Brussels was the de facto center of the organization. Statement 1 adds that official meetings were held in various cities depending on the agenda, which suggests that while Brussels may have been the primary location for the EEC, it was not necessarily the only city where important decisions were made. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the role of Brussels in the EEC."
