  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Khiva District?\" are contradictory. The first statement claims that Khiva District is not a recognized district or administrative division in any known country, while the second statement states that it is located in the Republic of Dagestan, which is a federal subject of Russia. The second statement provides a clear answer to the prompt, while the first statement is incorrect and misleading. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
