  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of \"Click\" are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the information provided in the text does not specify who directed the show. While statement 1 mentions Kevin McCarthy as a television director, it does not confirm whether he directed \"Click\". Therefore, both statements are consistent in their lack of information about the director of \"Click\"."
