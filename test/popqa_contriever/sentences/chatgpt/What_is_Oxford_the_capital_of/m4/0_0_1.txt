  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While Oxford is the county town of Oxfordshire, it is not the capital of any county in England. The term \"county town\" refers to the administrative center of a county, but it does not necessarily mean that the town is the capital of the county or region. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
