  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Seduced and Abandoned are contradictory. While Statement 1 claims that James Toback was the screenwriter, Statement 2 contradicts it by stating that he was the director. The correct information is that James Toback was the director of Seduced and Abandoned, but he did not have a screenwriter credit as the film was a documentary and did not have a traditional screenplay."
