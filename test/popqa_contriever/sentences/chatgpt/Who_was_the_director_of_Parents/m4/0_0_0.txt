  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they are both incorrect. The given text does not provide information about a director of Parents, but rather mentions a person named Parent who held various positions in sports and leisure, as well as serving as secretary and vice-chair of a committee for the Montreal Catholic School Commission. Therefore, the statements do not address the prompt and are irrelevant."
