Statement 1 uses the present tense \"is\" to indicate that Emperor Xiaowu is currently the father of Emperor An. Statement 2 uses the past tense \"was\" to indicate that Emperor Xiaowu was the father of Emperor An at a specific point in the past. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
