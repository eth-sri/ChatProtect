  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Gente di Roma? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Cesare Zavattini was the screenwriter for the film, while statement 2 claims that Sergio Amidei was the screenwriter. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct."
