  "explanation": "The statements about the location of Sognefjord are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Sognefjord is situated in Norway. The only difference is in the choice of words used to express the same idea. Statement 1 uses the verb \"is\" to indicate the location of Sognefjord, while Statement 2 uses the phrase \"located in\" to convey the same meaning. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but rather synonymous."
