  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges the conflicting interpretations of his beliefs, while the second statement suggests that his beliefs were not fixed and may have changed over time. Both statements allow for the possibility that Lincoln's religious views were complex and nuanced, and that they may have been influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, they are not contradictory, but rather complementary."
