  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory, but rather present different perspectives on his beliefs. Statement 1 acknowledges that there are those who reject the idea that Lincoln was a believing Christian, while Statement 2 acknowledges that there are those who claim he was. The text itself presents the idea that there are conflicting interpretations of Lincoln's beliefs, which is supported by both statements. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather provide different viewpoints on the debate surrounding Lincoln's religion."
