  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both suggest that while Lincoln may have believed in an all-powerful God, he did not necessarily adhere to any specific religious doctrine or practice. The first statement implies that Lincoln's religious beliefs were not clearly defined, while the second statement emphasizes that a belief in God does not necessarily equate to a specific religious affiliation. Together, they provide a nuanced understanding of Lincoln's religious beliefs."
