  "explanation": "The statements about Rumi's religion are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Rumi was a Muslim who followed the Sunni branch of Islam. The only difference is in the sentence structure and the use of the verb \"was\" versus \"was a Muslim who followed.\" However, both statements affirm that Rumi was a follower of Islam and specifically the Sunni tradition."
