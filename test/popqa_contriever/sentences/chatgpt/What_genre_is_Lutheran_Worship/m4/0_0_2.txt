  "explanation": "The two statements about the genre of Lutheran Worship are not contradictory. They both convey the same idea that Lutheran Worship is a traditional style of hymnody and liturgy that is based on the Lutheran Confessions. The only difference is the way the information is presented. Statement 1 uses Lutheran Worship as the subject and describes its genre, while Statement 2 uses the genre as the subject and identifies Lutheran Worship as an example of it."
