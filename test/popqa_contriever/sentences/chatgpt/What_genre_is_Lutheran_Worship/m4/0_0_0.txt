  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Lutheran Worship? are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Lutheran Worship is a traditional style of hymnody and liturgy. The only difference is that Statement 1 adds that this tradition is rooted in the Lutheran Confessions. However, this does not contradict Statement 2, as the traditional style of Lutheran Worship can still be recognized without necessarily referencing the Lutheran Confessions."
