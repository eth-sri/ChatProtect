  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"The Good Life\" are contradictory. The first statement identifies Sacha Distel as the original composer, while the second statement identifies Jack Reardon as the composer of the English lyrics. While Reardon did write the English lyrics for Tony Bennett's recording, he did not compose the original song. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
