  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Monday? are contradictory as they provide different names for the director of the show. Statement 1 claims that Sarah O'Gorman was the director, while statement 2 claims that Paul Duane was the director. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct."
