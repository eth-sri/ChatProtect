  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The General? are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that the screenwriter for The General is not mentioned in the given paragraph. Statement 2 acknowledges that the screenwriter for The General has already been mentioned in the preceding text, which is why it cannot generate a new sentence to fill the gap. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
