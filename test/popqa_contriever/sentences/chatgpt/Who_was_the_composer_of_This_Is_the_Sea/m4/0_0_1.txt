  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of This Is the Sea are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Mike Scott and Brian Kennedy composed the music for the film, while Statement 2 indicates that the film features seven different songs by The Waterboys. While Mike Scott is the lead singer of The Waterboys and shares music credits with Brian Kennedy for the film, it is not accurate to say that they composed the entire soundtrack. Therefore, the two statements present different information and cannot both be true."
