  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is the capital of Kabul?\" are not contradictory, but rather they address two different issues. Statement 1 clarifies that Kabul is the capital city of Afghanistan, while Statement 2 points out a mistake in the prompt and provides the correct question and answer. Therefore, both statements are correct and do not contradict each other."
