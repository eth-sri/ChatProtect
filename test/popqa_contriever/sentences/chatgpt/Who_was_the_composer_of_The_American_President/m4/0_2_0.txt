  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"The American President\" are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that if the question is referring to the movie score, it was composed by Marc Shaiman. The second statement provides information about a piece called \"The President's March\" or \"Hail Columbia\", which is sometimes referred to as the presidential anthem. Therefore, the two statements are providing information about different pieces and are not contradictory."
