  "explanation": "The statements about what sport Carlaw Park plays are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that Carlaw Park was primarily used for rugby league games, which is consistent with the fact that the park was named after an administrator in the sport of rugby league and that Arthur Carlaw played a role in establishing the sport in New Zealand. Statement 2 provides more specific information about the park's use as a rugby league stadium in Auckland."
