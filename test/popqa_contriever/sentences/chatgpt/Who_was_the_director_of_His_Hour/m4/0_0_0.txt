  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, as they both suggest that there is no known director of a production called \"His Hour\". Statement 1 acknowledges that there may be multiple productions with this title, while Statement 2 asserts that the title itself is not recognized. Both statements ultimately lead to the same conclusion that there is no clear answer to the question of who directed \"His Hour\"."
