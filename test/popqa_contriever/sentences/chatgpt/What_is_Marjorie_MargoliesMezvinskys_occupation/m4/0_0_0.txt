  "explanation": "The statements about Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements mention that she is a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Fels Institute of Government and an adjunct faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. The first statement adds that she is also a women's rights activist, while the second statement does not mention this aspect of her work. However, this difference does not make the statements contradictory."
