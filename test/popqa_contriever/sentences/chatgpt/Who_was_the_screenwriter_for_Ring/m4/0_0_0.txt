  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Ring? are not contradictory. Both statements are true. Ring Lardner Jr. was indeed a screenwriter, as stated in both statements. Additionally, he was also a member of the Hollywood Ten, a group of writers and directors who were blacklisted and jailed for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee about their alleged involvement with the Communist Party."
