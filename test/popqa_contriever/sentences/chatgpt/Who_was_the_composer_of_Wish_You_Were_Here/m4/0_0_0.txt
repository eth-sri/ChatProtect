  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Wish You Were Here\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify David Gilmour and Roger Waters as the composers of the music for the song. The only difference is that the second statement includes the title of the song in quotation marks, which is a more specific way of referring to the song."
