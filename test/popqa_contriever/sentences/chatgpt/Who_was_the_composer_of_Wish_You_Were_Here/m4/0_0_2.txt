  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Wish You Were Here\" are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that David Gilmour and Roger Waters worked together to write the music for the song. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence. Statement 2 explicitly states that the music was composed by Gilmour and Waters, while Statement 1 implies the same information by using the word \"collaborated.\""
