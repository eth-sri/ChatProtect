  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of King David? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Arthur Honegger as the composer of \"Le Roi David\" (King David), while statement 2 incorrectly identifies Jules Massenet as the composer of \"Le G\u00e9nie de la terre\". Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
