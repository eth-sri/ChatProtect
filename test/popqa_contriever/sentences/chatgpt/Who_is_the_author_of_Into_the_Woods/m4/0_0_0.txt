  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Into the Woods are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides the names of both the music and lyrics writer (Stephen Sondheim) and the book writer (James Lapine), while Statement 2 simply states that Into the Woods is a musical. Both statements provide different pieces of information about the musical, but they do not contradict each other."
