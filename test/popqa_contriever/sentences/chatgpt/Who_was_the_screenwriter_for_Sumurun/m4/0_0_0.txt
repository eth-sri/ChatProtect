  "explanation": "The two statements about the screenwriter for Sumuru are not contradictory. They both provide the same information that Johanna Nemeth was the screenwriter for the 2003 film Sumuru. The only difference is the inclusion of parentheses in the first statement, which is a formatting choice and does not change the meaning of the statement."
