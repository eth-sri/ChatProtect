  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Higher and Higher are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the original songs by The Horrors, which the remixes are based on, fall under the categories of post-punk and neo-psychedelia. However, statement 2 adds shoegaze as another genre that the original songs can be categorized under. The remixes on Higher can vary in genre depending on the style of each individual remix, but the original songs by The Horrors have consistent categorizations."
