Statement 1 says he was born in Ghazipur, while Statement 2 says he was born in a village named Gangauli located in the district of Ghazipur. While Ghazipur is mentioned in both statements, Statement 2 provides a more specific location within the district. Therefore, it is unclear which location is correct."
