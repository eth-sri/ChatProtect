  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Just Imagine? are contradictory, as they provide different names for the screenwriter of the film. One statement says it was Buddy G. DeSylva, while the other says it was Arthur Caesar. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct."
