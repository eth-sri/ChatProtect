  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of British India are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the capital was not fixed, while the second statement provides additional information about the various locations that served as the capital during the British Raj, including Calcutta until December 1911 and Delhi from 1911 onwards. Together, these statements provide a more complete answer to the question of what the capital of British India was."
