  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Theatre? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the wide genre diversity of theatre, including traditional genres such as tragedy, comedy, and drama, as well as other genres like tragicomedy and melodrama. The second statement simply reiterates the same point as the first statement, but with slightly different wording. Overall, both statements support the idea that theatre is not limited to a specific genre and can encompass a variety of genres and styles."
