  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for La Notte are contradictory. While statement 2 correctly identifies Michelangelo Antonioni as the director of the film, statement 1 is incorrect in stating that he was the screenwriter. In fact, Antonioni co-wrote the screenplay with Ennio Flaiano and Tonino Guerra. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
