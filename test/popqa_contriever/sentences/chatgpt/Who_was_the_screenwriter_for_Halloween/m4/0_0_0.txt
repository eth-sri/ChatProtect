  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Halloween are not contradictory. Both statements agree that John Carpenter was involved in writing the screenplay for the film. The only difference is that statement 1 includes Debra Hill as a co-writer, while statement 2 focuses solely on Carpenter's involvement as the writer and director."
