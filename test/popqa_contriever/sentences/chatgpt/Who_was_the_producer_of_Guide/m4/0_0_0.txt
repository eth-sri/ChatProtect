Statement 1 simply states that the producer is not mentioned in the given information, while Statement 2 explains that it cannot generate a sentence to fill the gap as the predicate requires a negative form and the answer already states that the producer is not mentioned. Both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
