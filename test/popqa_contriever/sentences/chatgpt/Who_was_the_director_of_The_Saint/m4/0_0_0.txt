  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Saint? are contradictory. The first statement claims that the director of The Saint was Phillip Noyce, while the second statement assumes that the question is referring to the 1997 film \"The Saint\" and confirms that Phillip Noyce was indeed the director of that film. While both statements agree on the director's name, the first statement does not specify which version of The Saint is being referred to, while the second statement assumes a specific context."
