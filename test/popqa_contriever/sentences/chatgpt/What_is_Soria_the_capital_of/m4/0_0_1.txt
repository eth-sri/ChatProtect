  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Soria the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements correctly identify Soria as the capital of the province of Soria, located in the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n in Spain. The only difference between the two statements is that the second statement specifies that Soria is located in the east of Castile and Le\u00f3n, while the first statement does not provide this additional detail."
