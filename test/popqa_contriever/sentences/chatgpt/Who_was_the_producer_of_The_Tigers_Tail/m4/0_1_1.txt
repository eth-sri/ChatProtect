  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of The Tiger's Tail? are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Kieran Corrigan as one of the producers, but lists Redmond Morris instead of Neil Jordan as the other producer. The second statement incorrectly lists Neil Jordan as one of the producers instead of Redmond Morris. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
