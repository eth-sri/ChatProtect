  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While Statement 1 clarifies that John Boorman is the director and not the producer of the film, Statement 2 confirms that John Boorman was involved in the making of The Tiger's Tail. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the director's role in the film, but only Statement 2 directly answers the prompt about the producer."
