  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Protocol are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Michael Prupas was the producer of Protocol, while Statement 2 claims that Jeffery S. Levitan was the producer. However, the provided text clearly states that Levitan co-founded Protocol Entertainment with Paul Bronfman and later took over sole ownership and control of the company. Therefore, Statement 2 is accurate, while Statement 1 is not supported by the information provided."
