  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Big Road? are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about A.I. Bezzerides' career as a screenwriter, with statement 1 providing a broader overview of his work in film noir and action films, and statement 2 highlighting specific movies he worked on. The text simply clarifies that there is no known movie or television show called \"The Big Road,\" but suggests that the question may have been referring to \"The Big Valley,\" which Bezzerides co-created."
