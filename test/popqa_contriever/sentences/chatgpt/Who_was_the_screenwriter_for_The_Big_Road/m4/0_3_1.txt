  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Big Road? are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about A.I. Bezzerides' career as a screenwriter and novelist, with statement 1 emphasizing his work in action films and statement 2 highlighting his contributions to film noir classics. The text simply clarifies that there is no known movie or television show called \"The Big Road,\" but suggests that the question may have been referring to \"The Big Valley,\" which Bezzerides co-created."
