  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Alt? are not contradictory. While the first statement explains that alt-lit is not a specific genre, the second statement highlights the common characteristics of alt-lit works, such as being experimental and influenced by internet culture. These characteristics do not necessarily define a specific genre, but rather a movement or community of writers who share similar interests and approaches to literature. Therefore, the two statements complement each other in providing a more comprehensive understanding of what alt-lit is."
