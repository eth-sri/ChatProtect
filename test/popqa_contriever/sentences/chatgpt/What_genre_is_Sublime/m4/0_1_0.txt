Both statements acknowledge that Sublime Frequencies releases cover a range of genres, including field recordings, folk and pop compilations, and radio collages. The only difference is that statement 2 adds that they also release DVDs. However, both statements agree that Sublime Frequencies is not a genre itself, but rather a record label that specializes in acquiring and exposing obscure sounds from various regions around the world."
