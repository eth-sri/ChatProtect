The first statement simply identifies Charles Caldwell Ryrie as one of the authors of a specific book titled \"So Great Salvation.\" The second statement provides additional information about Ryrie's background and expertise as an American Bible scholar and Christian theologian. Neither statement contradicts the other or makes any claim about Ryrie being the sole author of salvation."
