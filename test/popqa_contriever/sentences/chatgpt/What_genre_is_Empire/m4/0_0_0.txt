  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Empire are not contradictory. Both statements describe Empire as a comic book series that combines elements of science fiction and superhero genres. The first statement adds the additional genre of fantasy, while the second statement specifies that it is a limited series. However, both statements are consistent in their overall description of the series."
