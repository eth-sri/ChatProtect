  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the name of Samson's mother is not provided in the Bible or the film \"Samson and Delilah.\" The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that she is referred to as Manoah's wife, while statement 2 specifies that she is referred to as Samson's mother in the Bible and her name is not mentioned. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the same fact and do not contradict each other."
