  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that Matthew was a follower of Jesus and considered a saint in the Christian religion. The second statement simply clarifies that being a follower of Jesus makes Matthew a Christian, as Christianity is based on the teachings of Jesus. Therefore, both statements are consistent and complementary."
