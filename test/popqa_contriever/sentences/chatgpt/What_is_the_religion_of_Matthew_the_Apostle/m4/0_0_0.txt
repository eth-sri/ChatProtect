  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that Matthew was a follower of Jesus and belonged to the Christian religion. The first statement adds that he is considered a saint in Christianity, while the second statement specifies that he was an apostle of Jesus within the Christian faith. Therefore, both statements are consistent and complementary."
