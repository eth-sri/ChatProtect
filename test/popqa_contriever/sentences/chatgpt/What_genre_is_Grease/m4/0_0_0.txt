  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Grease are not contradictory. Statement 1 identifies Grease as a musical film, which is a broad genre that encompasses any film that features musical numbers as a significant part of the narrative. Statement 2 provides more specific information about the subgenre of Grease, which is a romantic comedy with musical elements. Therefore, both statements are accurate and complementary."
