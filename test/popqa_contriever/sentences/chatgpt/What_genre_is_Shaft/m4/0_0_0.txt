  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not contradictory. Both statements identify the album as belonging to the soul/funk genre, with the first statement specifying that it is a soundtrack album. The inclusion of instrumental tracks composed by Isaac Hayes for the film, as well as vocal selections, further support the classification of the album as soul/funk."
