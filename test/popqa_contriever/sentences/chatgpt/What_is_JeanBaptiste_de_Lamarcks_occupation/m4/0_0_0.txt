  "explanation": "The statements about Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck's occupation are not contradictory. The first statement provides a comprehensive list of his various occupations, including naturalist, soldier, biologist, and academic. The second statement simply specifies that he was a French naturalist, which is one of his occupations listed in the first statement. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about Lamarck's occupation."
