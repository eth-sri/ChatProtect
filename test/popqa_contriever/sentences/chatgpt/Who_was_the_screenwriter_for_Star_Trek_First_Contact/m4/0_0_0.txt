  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Star Trek: First Contact? are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that the screenwriter for the movie was not mentioned in the given text. Statement 2 acknowledges that it cannot generate a sentence for the prompt based on the information provided in the previous answer, which only mentions a co-writer for a book about the making of the movie. Therefore, both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
