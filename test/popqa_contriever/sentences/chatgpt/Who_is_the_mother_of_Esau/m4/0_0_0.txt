  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Esau are not contradictory. Both statements correctly identify Rebecca as the mother of Esau. The second statement simply adds that Rebecca is also the mother of Jacob, which is also true. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
