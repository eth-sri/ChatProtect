  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Weimar Republic are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the capital was Berlin, while Statement 2 claims that the capital was the city of Weimar. However, it is important to note that while Berlin was the official capital of the Weimar Republic, the National Assembly initially met in Weimar due to the street rioting in Berlin after the 1918 German Revolution. Therefore, both statements have some truth to them, but they are not entirely accurate on their own."
