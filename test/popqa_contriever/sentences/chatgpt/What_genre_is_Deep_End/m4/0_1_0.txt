  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Deep End? are not contradictory. Statement 1 clarifies that Deep End is not limited to a specific genre of music, but rather releases records in multiple genres within the hardcore punk and heavy metal umbrella. Statement 2 emphasizes that Deep End is a record label, not a band or musical group, which is a separate distinction from the genre of music they release."
