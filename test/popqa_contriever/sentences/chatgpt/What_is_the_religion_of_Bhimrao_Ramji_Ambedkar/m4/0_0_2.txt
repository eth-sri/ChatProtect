  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Ambedkar was born into a Hindu Mahar caste, but later converted to Buddhism in 1956. Statement 2 provides additional information about the mass conversion ceremony in Nagpur, where Ambedkar and his followers converted to Buddhism. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide a complete picture of Ambedkar's religious beliefs and practices."
