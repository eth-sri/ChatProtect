  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he converted to Buddhism, indicating that he was not a Hindu at the time of his death. The first statement provides additional information about his background, stating that he was born into a Hindu Mahar caste. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
