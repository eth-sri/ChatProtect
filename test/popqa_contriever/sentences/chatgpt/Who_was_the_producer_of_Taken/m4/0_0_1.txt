  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Taken are not contradictory. While both the TV series and the film are mentioned in the text, the prompt specifically asks about the producer of Taken, which refers to the 2008 film. The text does not provide information about the producer of the film, only the writer, director, and cast. The statements simply clarify that there are two different productions with the same name mentioned in the text."
