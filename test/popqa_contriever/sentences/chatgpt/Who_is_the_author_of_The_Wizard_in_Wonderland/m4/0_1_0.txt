  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Wizard in Wonderland? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there is no book titled \"The Wizard in Wonderland\" and that it appears to be a combination or confusion of two different books by different authors - \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll and \"The Wizard of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"combination\" in statement 1 and \"confusion\" in statement 2. However, both statements convey the same idea that \"The Wizard in Wonderland\" is not a real book and is likely a mix-up of two different books."
