  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of The House of God are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Samuel Shem is a pseudonym used by psychiatrist Stephen Bergman. Statement 1 provides additional information that the author's real name is Stephen Bergman, while Statement 2 only mentions the pseudonym. However, both statements are consistent in identifying the author of The House of God as Stephen Bergman writing under the pen name Samuel Shem."
