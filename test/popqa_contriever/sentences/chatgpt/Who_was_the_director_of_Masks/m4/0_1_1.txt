  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of \"Masks\" are not contradictory. While the director is not explicitly mentioned in the given passage, it is stated that Chuck Russell was offered the job of directing the film by New Line Cinema. Additionally, it is mentioned that Russell wanted the film to be less grim and more fun than the source material, indicating that he did in fact direct the film. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about the directorship of \"Masks.\""
