Both statements agree that Albert Maltz was the original screenwriter for The Robe, but his name did not appear in the credits when the movie was released in 1953 due to the Hollywood blacklist. Statement 1 explicitly mentions that Maltz wrote the original screenplay, while Statement 2 implies the same by stating that his name was not credited."
