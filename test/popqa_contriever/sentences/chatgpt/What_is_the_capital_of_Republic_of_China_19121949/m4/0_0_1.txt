  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Republic of China 1912-1949 are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides the information that the capital was Nanjing until it was relocated to Taipei in 1949, while Statement 2 simply reiterates that it was relocated from Nanjing to Taipei in 1949. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the capital of Republic of China during that period."
