  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of James I of Aragon are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that James I of Aragon was a devout Catholic who actively promoted the spread and expansion of Christianity in the regions under his rule. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the words \"spread\" and \"expansion,\" which are synonymous. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
