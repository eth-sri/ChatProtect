  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of \"What's Going On?\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that \"What's Going On?\" is not a known show or title, while the second statement suggests that the prompt may have been intended to refer to \"What's Happening!!\" instead. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
