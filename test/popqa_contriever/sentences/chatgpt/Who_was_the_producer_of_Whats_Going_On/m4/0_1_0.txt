Statement 1 acknowledges that \"What's Going On?\" is not a known show or title, which is true but not helpful in answering the prompt. Statement 2 clarifies that \"What's Going On?\" is not related to Bud Yorkin or \"What's Happening!!\", which is also true but does not provide any information about the producer of the latter show."
