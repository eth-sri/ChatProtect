  "explanation": "The statements about What color is Arsenal F.C.? are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that Arsenal is primarily associated with red and white, which is true as they wear a red and white home strip and have a red and white crest. The second statement adds that while they wear red and white as their home kit, they traditionally wear yellow and blue as their away kit. This does not contradict the first statement as it simply provides additional information about the colors Arsenal uses for their away kit."
