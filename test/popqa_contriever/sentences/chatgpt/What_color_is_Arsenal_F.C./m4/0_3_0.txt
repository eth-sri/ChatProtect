  "explanation": "The statements about the colors of Arsenal F.C. are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that the club is primarily associated with red and white due to their home strip and crest. The second statement adds that the club has had a variety of away strips throughout their history, including yellow and blue, green and navy, and darker shades of blue. The third statement specifies that one of these away strips is yellow and blue, which is consistent with the second statement. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other and provide a comprehensive overview of the colors associated with Arsenal F.C."
