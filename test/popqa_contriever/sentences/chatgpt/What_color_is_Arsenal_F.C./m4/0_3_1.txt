  "explanation": "The statements about the color of Arsenal F.C. are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that the club is primarily associated with red and white, which is true for their home strip and crest. The second statement acknowledges that the club has also worn other colors for their away strip throughout their history, including yellow and blue, green and navy, and darker shades of blue. Therefore, both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
