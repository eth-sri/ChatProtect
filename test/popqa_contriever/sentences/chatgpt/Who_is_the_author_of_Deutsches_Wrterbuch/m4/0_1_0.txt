The first statement acknowledges that Jacob Grimm was the primary author of Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch, but also acknowledges that his brother Wilhelm assisted in the early stages. The second statement simply adds that after Jacob Grimm's death, the project was continued by a team of scholars and lexicographers. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
