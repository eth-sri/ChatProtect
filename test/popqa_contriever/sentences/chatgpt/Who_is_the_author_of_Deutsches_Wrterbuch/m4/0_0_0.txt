  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Jacob Grimm was the primary author of the dictionary, with his brother Wilhelm assisting in the early stages. The second statement simply omits the mention of Wilhelm's contribution, but it does not contradict the first statement."
