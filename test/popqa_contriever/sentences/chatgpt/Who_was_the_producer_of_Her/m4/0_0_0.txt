Statement 1 claims that Megan Ellison was the producer of the movie \"Her\", while Statement 2 denies the validity of the prompt and states that Spike Jonze was the director and one of the producers of the movie. Therefore, the two statements present conflicting information about the producer of the movie \"Her\"."
