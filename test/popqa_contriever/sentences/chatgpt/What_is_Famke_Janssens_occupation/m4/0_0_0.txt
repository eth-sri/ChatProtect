  "explanation": "The statements about Famke Janssen's occupation are contradictory. While both statements identify her as an actress, the first statement provides additional information about her career as a fashion model and her education in economics and creative writing, suggesting a diverse professional background. The second statement, on the other hand, lacks any context or supporting details, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of Janssen's career."
