  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Novgorod Republic are not contradictory. While statement 1 directly states that the city of Novgorod was the capital, statement 2 provides additional information that the Novgorod Republic did not have a fixed capital, but the city of Novgorod was still considered its political and cultural center. Therefore, both statements are true and complement each other."
