  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Romanian Greek Catholic Church are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides more specific information about the denomination, including its relationship with the Roman Catholic Church and its use of the Byzantine liturgical rite in the Romanian language. Statement 2 is a more general statement that simply identifies the Romanian Greek Catholic Church as a Christian denomination. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
