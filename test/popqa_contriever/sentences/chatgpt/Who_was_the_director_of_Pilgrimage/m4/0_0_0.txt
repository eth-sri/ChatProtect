  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Pilgrimage are not contradictory. Statement 1 establishes that Green was the director of the Ampleforth pilgrimage, while Statement 2 specifies that he held this position until 1995. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about Green's role as the director of the pilgrimage."
