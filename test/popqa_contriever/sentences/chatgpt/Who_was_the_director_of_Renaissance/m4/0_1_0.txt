While it is not clear who the overall director of Renaissance was, it is mentioned that several classical actors, including Judi Dench, Geraldine McEwan, and Derek Jacobi, directed productions for Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road. This means that while there may not have been one specific director for Renaissance as a whole, there were multiple directors involved in the productions."
