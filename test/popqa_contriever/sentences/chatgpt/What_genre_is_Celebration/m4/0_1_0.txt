The first statement explains that \"Celebration\" is not a specific genre, but rather a term that can refer to music with certain characteristics. The second statement provides an example of how \"Celebration\" can be used as a title for an album that falls under a specific genre, in this case, folk-rock worship music. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
