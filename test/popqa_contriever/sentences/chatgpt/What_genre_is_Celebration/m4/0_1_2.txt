  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Celebration? are not contradictory. The first statement explains that \"Celebration\" is not a specific genre, but rather a term used to describe music that is lively and associated with festivities. The second statement provides a specific genre for the music on \"The Art of Celebration,\" which is folk-rock worship. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and provide different perspectives on the use of the term \"Celebration\" in music."
