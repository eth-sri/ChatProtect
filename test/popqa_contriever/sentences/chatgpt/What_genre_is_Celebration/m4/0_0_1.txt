  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Celebration?\" are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that there is no specific genre called \"Celebration,\" while the second statement provides information about the genre classification of Rend Collective, the band behind \"The Art of Celebration.\" The second statement does not claim that the album itself is a specific genre called \"Celebration,\" but rather provides context about the band's overall sound. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
