  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Celebration are not contradictory. The first statement provides a general definition of Celebration as a term that can refer to various genres of music that are upbeat and associated with festivities. The second statement specifies the genre of Rend Collective's album \"The Art of Celebration\" as folk-rock worship music, which is a specific genre within the broader category of Celebration music. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and provide different levels of specificity about the genre of Celebration music."
