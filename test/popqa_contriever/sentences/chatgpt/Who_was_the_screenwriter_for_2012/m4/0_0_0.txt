  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they are incomplete. While both statements mention the screenwriters for \"2012\" as Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser, they do not provide a complete answer to the prompt. The prompt asks specifically about the screenwriter, singular, for \"2012\". While Emmerich and Kloser both contributed to the screenplay, it is unclear which one is being referred to as the screenwriter in the prompt."
