  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Fog are contradictory. The first statement indicates that Debra Hill and John Carpenter co-wrote the original film and produced the 2005 remake, but it does not mention the screenwriter for the remake. The second statement explicitly states that the screenwriter for The Fog was Cooper Layne, which contradicts the implication of the first statement that Hill and Carpenter were the writers for the remake."
