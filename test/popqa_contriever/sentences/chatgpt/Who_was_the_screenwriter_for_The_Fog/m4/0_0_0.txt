  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Fog are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Debra Hill and John Carpenter co-wrote the original film, but only the first statement adds that they also served as producers for the 2005 remake. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the involvement of Hill and Carpenter in the creation of The Fog."
