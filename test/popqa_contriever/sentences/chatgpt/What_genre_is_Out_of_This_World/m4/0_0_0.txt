  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Out of This World are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the album doesn't fit into a specific genre because it is a collection of atmospheric sounds and effects. The second statement simply describes the album as a commercial LP release of atmospheric sounds and effects. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the album is not easily categorized into a specific genre."
