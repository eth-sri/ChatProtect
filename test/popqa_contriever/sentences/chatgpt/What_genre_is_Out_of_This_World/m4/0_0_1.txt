  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Out of This World are not necessarily contradictory, but rather offer different perspectives. Statement 1 suggests that the album does not fit neatly into a specific genre due to its focus on atmospheric sounds and effects. Statement 2, on the other hand, identifies the album as experimental music, which can be seen as a genre that often incorporates unconventional sounds and techniques. While the two statements may seem to offer different answers, they can both be true depending on how one defines and categorizes genres."
