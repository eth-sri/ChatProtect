  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Bouvet Island is not part of any country, meaning it is not a sovereign state or a dependent territory. However, the second statement provides additional information about the location and characteristics of the island, including the fact that it is governed by Norway as an uninhabited territory. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
