  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Bouvet Island?\" are not contradictory, but rather present two different perspectives. Statement 1 highlights the fact that Bouvet Island is not officially part of any country, while Statement 2 acknowledges that it is considered a dependent territory of Norway. Therefore, while it is not a sovereign state or part of any country, it does have a political affiliation with Norway."
