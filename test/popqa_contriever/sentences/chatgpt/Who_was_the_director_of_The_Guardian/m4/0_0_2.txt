  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that the AI language model does not have access to real-time information, which means it cannot provide an up-to-date answer to the question. The second statement highlights that the prompt does not provide a timeline, making it difficult to determine which director of The Guardian is being referred to. Therefore, both statements provide additional context and limitations to answering the prompt."
