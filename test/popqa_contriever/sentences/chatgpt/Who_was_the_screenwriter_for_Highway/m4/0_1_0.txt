  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the screenwriter for Highway?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the information does not specify the screenwriter for \"Highway,\" while Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that A.I. Bezzerides was the screenwriter for \"Thieves' Highway\" (1949), which is the movie in question. Therefore, Statement 2 provides the answer to the prompt, while Statement 1 is incorrect."
