  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Miss Brown to You\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify Richard A. Whiting and Ralph Rainger as the composers of the song's music. The first statement includes the song's title, while the second statement specifies that the composers wrote the music. Therefore, both statements provide consistent information about the song's composers."
