  "explanation": "The statements about \"What sport does penalty play?\" are not contradictory. Both statements refer to the same sport, which is ice hockey. The first statement uses the term \"penalty play\" to refer to the situation where a player is awarded a penalty shot, while the second statement uses the more commonly used term \"penalty shot\". Therefore, both statements are correct and do not contradict each other."
