Both statements confirm that Caesar Baronius was a member of the Roman Catholic Church and a cardinal, which is a high-ranking position within the Church. The second statement further specifies that he was an ecclesiastical historian, indicating his involvement in the study and documentation of Church history. Therefore, both statements support the conclusion that Caesar Baronius was a Roman Catholic."
