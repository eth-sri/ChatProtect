  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Now and Then? are not contradictory. Both statements mention \"The Prince\" and \"The Mandrake\" by Machiavelli, but only statement 1 adds \"Then and Now\" by W. Somerset Maugham. Therefore, statement 1 provides more information than statement 2, but they both agree on the fact that Machiavelli wrote \"The Prince\" and \"The Mandrake\"."
