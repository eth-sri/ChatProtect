  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Birthday? are not contradictory, but they are not directly related to each other. Statement 1 correctly states that the given information does not mention any composer of a piece called \"Birthday\". Statement 2 provides additional information about a composer who did have a piece called \"Birthday\", but it is not relevant to the given information or the prompt. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other, but they do not provide a coherent answer to the prompt."
