  "explanation": "The statements do not directly answer the prompt \"What is the capital of Province of Georgia?\" and therefore are not contradictory to each other or to the prompt. Statement 1 provides information about the limitations of the AI language model's training data, while Statement 2 provides the date when Georgia became a state in the United States. Further information would be needed to answer the prompt about the capital of the Province of Georgia."
