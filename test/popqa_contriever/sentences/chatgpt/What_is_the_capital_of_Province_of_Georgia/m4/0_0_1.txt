  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the AI language model's training data only goes until the United States obtained independence from Great Britain, and therefore it cannot provide information about the capital of the Province of Georgia during British colonial rule. The second statement provides information about the United States obtaining the Province of Georgia from Great Britain in 1783, which is after the period covered by the AI language model's training data."
