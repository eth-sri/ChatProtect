  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that the AI language model does not have updated information on the current governance or political status of Georgia, which may affect the answer to the question. The second statement highlights the ambiguity of the question, as there are multiple locations with the name \"Georgia\" and it is unclear which one the question is referring to. Therefore, both statements provide valid reasons for why the AI language model cannot answer the question accurately."
