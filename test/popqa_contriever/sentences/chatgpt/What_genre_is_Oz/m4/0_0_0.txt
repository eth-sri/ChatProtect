  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Oz are not contradictory, but they are incomplete. While both statements correctly identify Oz as a television drama series, they do not provide any information about the specific genre within the drama category. Oz is often categorized as a crime drama or a prison drama due to its focus on the lives of inmates in a maximum-security prison."
