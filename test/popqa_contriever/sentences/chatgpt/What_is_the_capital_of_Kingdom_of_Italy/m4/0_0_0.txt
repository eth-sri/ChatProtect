  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the Kingdom of Italy had multiple capital cities throughout its history, while Statement 2 specifies that Florence was the capital from 1865 to 1871 and Rome was the capital from 1871 until the monarchy was abolished in 1946. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the capital cities of the Kingdom of Italy."
