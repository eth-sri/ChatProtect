  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Turin was the first capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, which later became the Kingdom of Italy. Statement 2 confirms that Turin was indeed the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
