  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the Kingdom of Italy had several different capital cities throughout its history, and the second statement specifies that Florence became the capital in 1865 following the unification of Italy. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about the capital cities of the Kingdom of Italy."
