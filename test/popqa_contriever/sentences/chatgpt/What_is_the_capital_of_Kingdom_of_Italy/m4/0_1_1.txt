  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about the different capital cities that the Kingdom of Italy had throughout its history. Statement 1 explains that Turin was the first capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and remained the capital until 1865, when Florence became the capital. Statement 2 adds that Turin was also the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 to 1865. Therefore, both statements are true and complement each other."
