  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kingdom of Italy are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Rome became the capital of Italy in 1871, but they provide different details about how and why it happened. Statement 1 mentions the leadership of Prime Minister Giovanni Lanza and King Victor Emmanuel II, while Statement 2 emphasizes the capture of Rome by Italian troops. These are complementary pieces of information that do not contradict each other."
