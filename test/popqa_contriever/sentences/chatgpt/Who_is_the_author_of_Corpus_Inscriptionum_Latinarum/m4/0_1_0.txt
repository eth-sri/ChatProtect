  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the collection of Latin inscriptions was compiled by a group of scholars, with Theodor Mommsen playing a prominent role in the project. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically refers to the group as a committee, while statement 1 does not use that term. However, this difference in wording does not change the overall meaning or accuracy of the statements."
