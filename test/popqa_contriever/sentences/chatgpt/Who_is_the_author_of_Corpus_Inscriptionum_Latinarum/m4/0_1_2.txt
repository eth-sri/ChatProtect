  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are not contradictory. They both acknowledge that the collection was compiled by many scholars, but also recognize the significant role that Theodor Mommsen played in organizing and leading the project. Statement 1 provides more detail about the involvement of multiple scholars, while statement 2 focuses specifically on Mommsen's leadership role. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum."
