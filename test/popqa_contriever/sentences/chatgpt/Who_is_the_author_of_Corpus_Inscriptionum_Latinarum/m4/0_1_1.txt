The first statement acknowledges that there is no single author of the collection, while the second statement clarifies that it was compiled by a committee of scholars, with Theodor Mommsen playing a prominent role. Both statements provide complementary information about the collaborative nature of the project and the involvement of multiple scholars in its creation."
