  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Russian Empire are not contradictory. They both provide the same information that Saint Petersburg was the capital during the periods 1713-1728 and 1732-1918. The only difference is the use of an en dash in the second statement instead of a hyphen, which is a minor grammatical difference and does not affect the meaning of the statement."
