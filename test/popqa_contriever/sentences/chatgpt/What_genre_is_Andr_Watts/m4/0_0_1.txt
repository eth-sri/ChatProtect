  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Andr\u00e9 Watts are not contradictory. Both statements describe him as a classical pianist, but the second statement provides additional information about his specialization within the classical genre, focusing on Romantic composers. Therefore, the two statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
