The first statement clarifies that there is no specific composer who is referred to as \"the composer of Arkansas.\" The second statement provides information about Florence Price, who was a highly acclaimed composer born in Little Rock, Arkansas. While she is often associated with the state, she is not referred to as \"the composer of Arkansas\" in a formal or official capacity. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
