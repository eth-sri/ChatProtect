The first statement clarifies that there is no one composer who is commonly referred to as \"the composer of Arkansas.\" The second statement acknowledges that while there is no single composer of Arkansas, Florence Price was a notable composer who was born in the state. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
