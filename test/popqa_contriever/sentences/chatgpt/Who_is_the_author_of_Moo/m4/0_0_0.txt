  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Moo? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that The Big Moo is a collection of essays written by 32 different authors in the field of marketing, without a single identified author. The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the phrase \"in the field of marketing\" in the first statement, which provides additional context about the authors' expertise."
