  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who was the producer of The Hurricane are contradictory. The first statement claims that Samuel Goldwyn was the producer of the 1937 film \"The Hurricane\", while the second statement claims that Dino De Laurentiis was the producer of \"The Hurricane\". These two statements cannot both be true, as they refer to different productions of the same story."
