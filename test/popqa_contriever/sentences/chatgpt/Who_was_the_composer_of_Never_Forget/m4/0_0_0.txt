  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of Never Forget are not contradictory. Both statements identify Gary Barlow as the primary songwriter for the musical, with additional music and lyrics by other artists. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"features\" in the first statement and \"in\" in the second statement, but this does not change the overall meaning or identification of the composer."
