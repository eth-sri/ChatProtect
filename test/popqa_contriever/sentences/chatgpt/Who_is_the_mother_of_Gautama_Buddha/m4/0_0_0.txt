  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Gautama Buddha are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Maya is the mother of Gautama Buddha, but the second statement clarifies that Maya is the birth mother of Gautama Buddha. This is important because Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b, who is also referred to as the Buddha's mother, was his adoptive mother and step-mother. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the mother of Gautama Buddha."
