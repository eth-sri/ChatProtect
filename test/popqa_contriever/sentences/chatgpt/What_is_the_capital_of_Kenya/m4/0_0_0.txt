  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. While both statements provide the same answer to the prompt, they cannot be considered as a valid response to the question as they lack any additional information or context. Additionally, the prompt asks for an explanation of what the capital of Kenya is, not just a repetition of the answer. Therefore, the statements do not fulfill the requirements of the prompt and are contradictory in their lack of substance."
