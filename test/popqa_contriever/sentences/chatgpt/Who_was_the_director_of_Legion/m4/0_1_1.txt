The first statement clarifies that while \u00c1lvaro Corcuera was the former director of the Legion of Christ, he was on sabbatical for health reasons and Sylvester Heereman had assumed responsibility for running the Legion until a General Chapter was convened. The second statement simply reiterates that Corcuera was on sabbatical for health reasons."
