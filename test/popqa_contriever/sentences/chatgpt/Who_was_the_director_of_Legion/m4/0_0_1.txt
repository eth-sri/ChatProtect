  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Legion? are not contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Sylvester Heereman assumed the responsibility for running the Legion temporarily, while Statement 2 identifies \u00c1lvaro Corcuera as the former director. This means that \u00c1lvaro Corcuera was the director before his sabbatical, but during his absence, Sylvester Heereman took over as the temporary director."
