They both state that Sylvester Heereman assumed responsibility for running the Legion of Christ due to \u00c1lvaro Corcuera being on sabbatical for health reasons. The first statement also mentions that Heereman replaced Father Luis Garza as territorial director of North America, while the second statement does not include this information. However, this does not contradict the fact that Heereman took over as the temporary leader of the Legion."
