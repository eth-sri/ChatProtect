  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Bede are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Bede was a Christian and a monk. The first statement adds that he spent most of his life in the monastery at Wearmouth \u2013 Jarrow and wrote extensively on the history of the Christian Church in England. The second statement adds that most of his writings were about the history of the Christian church and the lives of the saints. Both statements provide complementary information about Bede's religious beliefs and his contributions to the Christian Church."
