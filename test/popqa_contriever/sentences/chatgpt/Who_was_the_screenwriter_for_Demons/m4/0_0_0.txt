  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Demons? are contradictory. The first statement refers to \"Night of the Demons\" while the second statement refers to \"Demons\". \"Night of the Demons\" and \"Demons\" are two different horror films with different screenwriters. \"Night of the Demons\" was written by Joe Augustyn and Steve Jankowski, while \"Demons\" was written by Dardano Sacchetti and Lamberto Bava."
