  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the director of The Message?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the director of \"The Message\" is not mentioned in the given text, while statement 2 clarifies that the prompt is actually referring to \"Messages\" and provides the name of the director as David Fairman. Therefore, statement 2 contradicts statement 1 by providing the requested information about the director of the correct film."
