  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Blow are not contradictory. Both statements mention David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes as the screenwriters for the film. The second statement provides additional information that they adapted Bruce Porter's book for the screenplay. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
