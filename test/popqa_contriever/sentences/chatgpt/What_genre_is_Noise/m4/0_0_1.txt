  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Noise? are not contradictory. They both convey the same idea that noise music is often considered as a collection of genres or an aesthetic rather than a single genre. The only difference is that statement 2 includes an additional phrase \"and it is considered a collection of genres\" which reinforces the idea that noise music is not limited to a single genre."
