  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that noise music is not limited to a single genre, but rather encompasses various genres that incorporate unconventional sound elements. Statement 2 supports this idea by stating that noise music has been represented by many genres throughout the 20th century and beyond. Both statements suggest that noise music is not easily classified as a single genre, but rather a diverse and evolving collection of musical styles."
