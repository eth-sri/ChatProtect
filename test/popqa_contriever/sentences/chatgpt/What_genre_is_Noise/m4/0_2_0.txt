  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Noise? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that noise music is not a specific or clearly defined genre, but rather a broad term that encompasses various forms of experimental and avant-garde music. The first statement highlights that noise music is considered a collection of genres, while the second statement emphasizes that its scope is unclear. Together, these statements suggest that noise music is a complex and diverse category of music that defies easy classification."
