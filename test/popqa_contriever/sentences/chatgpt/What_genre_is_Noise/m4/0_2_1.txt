  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Noise? are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that noise music is not a specific genre but rather a broad term that includes various forms of experimental and avant-garde music. Statement 2 further emphasizes the ambiguity surrounding the classification of noise music as a specific genre. Both statements suggest that noise music is not easily defined or categorized as a single genre."
