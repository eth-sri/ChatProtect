  "context": "The Bishop's Heir The Bishop's Heir is a fantasy novel by American-born author Katherine Kurtz. It was first published by Del Rey Books in 1984. It was the seventh of Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the first book in her third Deryni trilogy, The Histories of King Kelson. Although The Legends of Camber of Culdi trilogy was published immediately prior to the Histories trilogy, \"The Bishop's Heir\" is a direct sequel to Kurtz' first Deryni series, The Chronicles of the Deryni. The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms."
