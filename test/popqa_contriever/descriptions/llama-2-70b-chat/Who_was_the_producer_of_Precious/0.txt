  "context": "two production companies had previously collaborated with Daniels on \"Tennessee\" (2008). \"Precious\" had, in total, thirteen producers: Daniels, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Heller, Tyler Perry, Lisa Cortes, Gary Magness, Valerie Hoffman, Asger Hussain, Mark G. Mathis, Andrew Sforzini, Bergen Swason, Simone Sheffield and Sarah Siegel-Magness. Initially, Daniels did not expect the movie to generate much buzz, expecting the movie to go straight to video, stating \"That it made it to the big screen says there was an angel looking after me.\" Principal photography (filming) for the film took place on location in various parts of New York City."
