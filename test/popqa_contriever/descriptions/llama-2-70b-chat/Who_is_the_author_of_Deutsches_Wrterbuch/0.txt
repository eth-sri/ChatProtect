  "context": "first edition was finished. The revision was intended especially to bring the oldest part of the \"Dictionary\", the letters A-F originally authored by the Brothers Grimm, up to date. It also was to be a cooperative effort between East-West: the Academy of Sciences of the GDR in East Berlin would complete A-C, and the University of G\u00f6ttingen in the West would complete D-F. The initial fascicles of this revision were published in 1965, but it remains unfinished today, with the letters B and C (originally assigned to the Berlin team) still in progress."
