Released on 15 April 2016, by the band's Edamame record label, the EP contains the band's first new material since 1996, following their reunion in 2015. It was produced by Jim Abbiss and Ladytron member Daniel Hunt. The EP was recorded before the band started rehearsals for their 2015-16 reunion. The first stage involved recording home demos, which were sent to co-producer Hunt, who was in Brazil at the time. The second stage was recorded in co-producer Abbiss's Lime Green Monkey studio."
