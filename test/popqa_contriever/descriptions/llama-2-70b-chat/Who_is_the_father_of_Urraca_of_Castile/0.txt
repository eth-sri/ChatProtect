She claimed the imperial title as suo jure \"Empress of All the Spains\" and \"Empress of All Galicia\". Born in Burgos, Urraca was the eldest and only surviving child of Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n with his second wife Constance of Burgundy; for this, she was heir presumptive of the Kingdoms of Castile and Le\u00f3n until 1107, when her father recognized his illegitimate son Sancho as his heir."
