  "context": "Ariane et Barbe-bleue Ariane et Barbe-bleue (\"Ariadne and Bluebeard\") is an opera in three acts by Paul Dukas. The French libretto is adapted (with very few changes) from the symbolist play of the same name by Maurice Maeterlinck, itself loosely based on the French literary tale \"La Barbe bleue\" by Charles Perrault. Dukas had been impressed by Maeterlinck's play when it was first published in 1899. Maeterlinck had initially reserved the rights to use \"Ariane\" as a libretto for Edvard Grieg. When Grieg abandoned his plans to compose the opera, Maeterlinck offered it to Dukas instead."
