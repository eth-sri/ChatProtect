  "context": "of the newly-reborn Poland. In 1920 the mining school was significantly expanded and was renamed to Carpathian Geological Station, a \"de facto\" oil mining university. As the capital of the \"Zag\u0142\u0119bie Borys\u0142awskie\" (\"Borys\u0142aw Oil Basin\"), the town of Borys\u0142aw was the centre of then Polish oil and ozokerite extraction industries and one of the most important industrial zones of Poland. Because of that, on July 26, 1933, the town was granted a city charter. Together with the nearby settlement of Tustanowice (Tustanovychi, now part of Boryslav), Boryslaw produced in 1925 about 80% of Polish oil (812,000 tons)."
