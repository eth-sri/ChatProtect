  "context": "had them hire Ray to direct it. Crawford wanted either Bette Davis or Barbara Stanwyck for the role of Emma Small, but they were too expensive. Claire Trevor was next in mind for the role but was unable to accept because she was tied up with another film. Finally, Nicholas Ray brought in McCambridge. Most people claimed Crawford was easy to work with, always professional, generous, patient and kind. Issues between the two women cropped up early on, but Ray was not alarmed \u2013 at first."
