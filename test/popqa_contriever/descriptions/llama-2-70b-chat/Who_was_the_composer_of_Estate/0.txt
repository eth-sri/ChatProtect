  "context": "titled \"Estate\" (Summer) by Joel E. Siegel for Shirley Horn (1987), and the other titled \"In Summer\" by Jon Hendricks (1990). Estate (song) \"Estate\" is an Italian song written in 1960 by Bruno Martino (music) and Bruno Brighetti (lyrics). A minor hit in Italy when released, it eventually became a worldwide jazz standard largely through its Bossa nova interpretation by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto. The title refers to summer, and the lyrics describe a love lost during summer and the bitter memories that come with the season ever since."
