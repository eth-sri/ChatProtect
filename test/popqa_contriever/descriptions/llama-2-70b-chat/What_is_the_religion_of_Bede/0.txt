  "context": "a strong religious past, as can be seen in works such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". The work of the 7th-century Cuthbert (634\u2013687 AD), Bede (673\u2013735 AD) and Hilda of Whitby (614\u2013680 AD) were hugely influential in the early church, and are still venerated by some today. These saints are usually associated with the monasteries on the island of Lindisfarne, Wearmouth \u2013 Jarrow, and the Abbey at Whitby, though they are also associated with many other religious sites in the region. Bede is regarded as the greatest Anglo-Saxon scholar."
