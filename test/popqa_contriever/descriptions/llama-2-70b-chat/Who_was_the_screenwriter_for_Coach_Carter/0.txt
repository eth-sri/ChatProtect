It is based on the true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson), who made headlines in 1999 for suspending his undefeated high school basketball team due to poor academic results. The story was conceived from a screenplay co-written by John Gatins and Mark Schwahn, who created the TV series \"One Tree Hill.\" The film also recycles a handful of plot devices from another television series, \"The White Shadow,\" which director Carter also co-starred in."
