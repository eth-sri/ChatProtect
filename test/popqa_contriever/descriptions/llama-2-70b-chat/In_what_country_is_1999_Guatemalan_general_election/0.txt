  "context": "1999 Guatemalan general election General elections were held in Guatemala on 7 November 1999, with a second round of the presidential elections on 26 December. Alfonso Portillo won the presidential elections, whilst his Guatemalan Republican Front also won the Congressional elections. Voter turnout was 53.8% on 7 November and 40.4% on 26 December. Media owner Remigio \u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez gave more than $2.6 million and free airtime to Alfonso Portillo's campaign, which led to some political analysts to claim that the free adverts helped Portillo win the election."
