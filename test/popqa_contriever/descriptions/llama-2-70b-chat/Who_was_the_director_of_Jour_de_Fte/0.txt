  "context": "Jour de f\u00eate Jour de f\u00eate (\"The Big Day\") is a 1949 French comedy film starring Jacques Tati in his feature film directional debut as an inept and easily distracted mailman in a backward French village. Shot largely in and around Sainte-S\u00e9v\u00e8re-sur-Indre, where Tati had lived during the Occupation, most of the actors were unknown and villagers served as extras. On a public holiday, the village square hosts a little travelling fair and cinema tent. Among the locals introduced is Fran\u00e7ois, the amiable and bumbling mailman, who everybody likes but nobody takes seriously."
