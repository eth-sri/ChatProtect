  "context": "composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \"African Waltz\" (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\" \"I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni.\" But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. \"We work independently\", explained MacDermot in May 1968. \"I prefer it that way. They hand me the material."
