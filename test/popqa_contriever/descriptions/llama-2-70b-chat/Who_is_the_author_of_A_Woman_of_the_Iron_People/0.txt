It is a first contact story between peoples from a future Earth and an intelligent, furred race of \"people\" who live on an unnamed planet far from Earth. Along with \"White Queen\", \"A Woman of the Iron People\" won the inaugural James Tiptree Jr. Award in 1991. The later paperback edition consisted of two separate volumes, \"In the Light of Sigma Draconis\" and \"Changing Women\", split at the natural dividing point of the novel."
