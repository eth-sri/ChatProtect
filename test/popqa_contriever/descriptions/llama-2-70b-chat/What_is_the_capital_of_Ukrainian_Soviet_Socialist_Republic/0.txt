  "context": "in the media as \"Kharkov \u2013 Pervaya Stolitsa (the first capital)\" with implication to the era of Soviet regime. Kharkiv was also the city where the first Soviet Ukrainian government was created in 1917 with strong support from Russian SFSR authorities. However, in 1934, the capital was moved from Kharkiv to Kiev, which remains the capital of Ukraine today, although at first Kharkiv retained some government offices and buildings for some time after the move. During the 1930s, there were significant numbers of ethnic minorities living within the Ukrainian SSR."
