  "context": "Cows (band) Cows were a post-hardcore/noise rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band formed in 1987 and disbanded in 1998. They were known for a unique mixture of punk rock played with large amounts of noise and surreal humour; their music is often considered noise rock. Their CD releases are often difficult to find, as most of them are out of print, with the exception of \"Whorn\" and \"Orphan's Tragedy\". Some of their albums were never released in CD format. They have a star on what is probably the most famous venue in the area, First Avenue."
