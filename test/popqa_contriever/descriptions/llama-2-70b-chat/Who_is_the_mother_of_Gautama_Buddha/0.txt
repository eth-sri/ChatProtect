In Buddhist tradition, she was the first woman to seek ordination for women, which she did from Gautama Buddha directly, and she became the first bhikkhuni (Buddhist nun). Tradition says Maya and Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b were Koliyan princess and sisters of Suppabuddha. Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b was both the Buddha's maternal aunt and adoptive mother, raising him after her sister Maya, the Buddha's birth mother, died. Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b died at the age of 120."
