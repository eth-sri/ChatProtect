  "context": "Astaire tries to analyze a scatter-brained patient, played by Grace Hayle. The film was released on 2 September 1938. The previous Astaire-Rogers film, \"Shall We Dance\", had been released in May 1937, and the 16-month gap between the films was the longest between Astaire-Rogers films to that date. The songs in \"Carefree\" were all written by Irving Berlin, and except for \"Change Partners,\" which he had written for Astaire and Rogers years before, he wrote them all over the course of a few days, while on vacation in Phoenix, Arizona."
