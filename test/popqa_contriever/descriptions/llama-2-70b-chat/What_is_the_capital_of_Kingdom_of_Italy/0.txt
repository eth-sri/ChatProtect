  "text": "The capital of the Kingdom of Italy was Turin (Torino), which was the capital of the House of Savoy, the ruling dynasty of the kingdom. Turin was chosen as the capital because it was the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, which was the predecessor state to the Kingdom of Italy, and it was the seat of the royal court and the government. The capital remained in Turin until 1865, when it was moved to Florence, and later to Rome in 1871, where it remained until the end of the kingdom in 1946.",
