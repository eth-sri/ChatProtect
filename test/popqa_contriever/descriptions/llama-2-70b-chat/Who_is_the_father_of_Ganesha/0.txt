Krishna Kumar (played by Dileep) is the innocent son of an unscrupulous father, struggling to build a political base in the midst of deceit, intrigue and cut-throat competition. His father, quite aptly named Balagangadhara Menon, is a seasoned and corrupt politician, and he has two diabolic sons-in-law to assist him in his dark deeds. How the son grew up to be so virtuous is a total mystery! The film, despite the exaggerated and unrealistic story line was a thorough entertainer and did extremely well at the box office."
