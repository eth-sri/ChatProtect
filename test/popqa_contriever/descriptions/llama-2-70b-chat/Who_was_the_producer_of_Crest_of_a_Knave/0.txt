  "context": "Crest of a Knave Crest of a Knave is the sixteenth studio album by British rock band Jethro Tull, released in 1987. The album was recorded after a hiatus of three years occasioned by a throat infection of vocalist Ian Anderson. After the unsuccessful \"Under Wraps\", the band returned to a more heavily blended electric with acoustic style of sound, one of the top characteristics of Jethro Tull. The album was their most successful since the 1970s, and the band enjoyed a resurgence on radio broadcasts, appearances in MTV specials, and the airing of music videos."
