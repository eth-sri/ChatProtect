  "context": "some solo songs (including \"Never Back Again\") in 1984 in the United Kingdom, but a solo career beyond Idaho never materialized. Idaho's sonic stylings range from existentially introspective songs to cathartic screaming, though their music falls in the first category the majority of the time. Their music is traditionally categorized as slowcore or sadcore. The band has released nine full-length albums, as well as numerous EPs and singles, dating back to 1992."
