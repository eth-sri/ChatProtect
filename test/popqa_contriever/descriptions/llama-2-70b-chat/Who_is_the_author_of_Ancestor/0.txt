  "context": "him, \"in memory of childhoods identical but for the accidents of time and space\". He founded and edited a profusely-illustrated quarterly scholarly periodical on genealogical subjects, called \"The Ancestor\" (1902-1905), which attempted to debunk many popular myths of the Victorian era and to replace them with properly referenced facts, concentrating especially on the medieval period. \"The Ancestor\" discontinued publication with its twelfth issue. From this venture, he moved to the \"Victoria County History\", where he contributed on matters on heraldry and genealogy."
