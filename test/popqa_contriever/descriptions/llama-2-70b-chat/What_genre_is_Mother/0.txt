The game's soundtrack contains several tracks later used in subsequent series games. \"Mother\" received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score of 31/40 from Japanese reviewer \"Weekly Famitsu\". Reviewers noted the game's similarities with the \"Dragon Quest\" series and its simultaneous \"parody\" of the genre's tropes. They thought the game's sequel, \"EarthBound\", to be very similar and a better implementation of \"Mother\" gameplay ideas. Critics also noted the game's high difficulty level and balance issues. \"Mother\" sold 400,000 copies."
