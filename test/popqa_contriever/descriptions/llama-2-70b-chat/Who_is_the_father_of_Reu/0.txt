  "context": "Reu Reu or Ragau ( \"R\u02c1u\") in Genesis was the son of Peleg and the father of Serug, thus being Abraham's great-great-grandfather. He was 32 when Serug was born and lived to the age of 239 (), according to the Masoretic text. The Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch state that his age on fathering Serug was 132, and the Septuagint thus gives age at death as 339. The \"Book of Jubilees\" names his mother as Lomna of Shinar (10:28), and his wife as Ora, daughter of Ur Kesed (11:1)."
