  "context": "Arrival (composition) \"Arrival\" is a 1976 composition by Swedish pop group ABBA featured on their album of the same name. It is an instrumental piece, mainly the brainchild of member Benny Andersson and had the working titles of \"Fiol\", \"Ode to Dalecarlia\" and \"Arrival in Dalecarlia\". \"Arrival\" was the second and last composition from the group not to contain lyrics, following \"Intermezzo No.1\" the previous year. As with \"Intermezzo No.1\", the choral tune, heavily influenced by traditional Swedish folk music, was written by Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus. It was recorded on 30 August 1976 at Stockholm's Metronome Studio."
