The passage only mentions that Isis is the wife of Osiris and the mother of Horus, and that she also has a dual role as the consort of Horus the Elder and the mother of the sons of Horus. Therefore, it is not clear who Isis' father is.",

  "context": "worship the dead person, and his name means literally \"he who worships his mother\". In the Coffin Texts Horus calls upon him, \"Come and worship my father N for me, just as you went that you might worship my mother Isis in your name Duamutef.\" Isis had a dual role. Not only was she the wife of Osiris and the mother of Horus, but she was also the consort of Horus the Elder and thus the mother of the sons of Horus."
