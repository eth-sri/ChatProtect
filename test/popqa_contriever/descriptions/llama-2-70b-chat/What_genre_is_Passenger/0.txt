Originally, mixing duties were to be handled by Andy Sneap, but the band later decided to have Tue Madsen (producer and mixer on both previous albums) mix instead. Christian Olde Wolbers from Fear Factory also did co-production work for this album. Since this album, the guitarists use downtuned 7 string guitars."
