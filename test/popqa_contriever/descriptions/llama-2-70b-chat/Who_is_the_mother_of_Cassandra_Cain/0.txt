  "context": "that Cassandra would be introduced into mainstream continuity in \"Batman & Robin Eternal\". Her father, David Cain, is portrayed as a character named the \"Orphan\", who raises Cassandra alone and forces her not to speak but to \"listen\" to body movements and react accordingly with deadly precision. She was intended to be a \"gift\" to the villain \"Mother\", to show her that child assassins can be manipulated through \"the old ways\" instead of through the use of drugs, but \"Mother\" rejected her and told Orphan never to do anything behind her back again."
