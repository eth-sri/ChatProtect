  "context": "Warning (UK band) Warning is a UK-based doom metal band. Warning flagged the rise of post-2000 wave of traditional doom metal. The band was founded by guitarist/singer/songwriter Patrick Walker in 1994 in Harlow, Essex. Warning's music is notable for its down-tempo, progressive, melodic and heavy doom-laden sound; the idiosyncratic and poignant vocals of Patrick Walker; and his introspective, darkly-confessional lyrical themes. The band released two demo tapes, \"Revelation Looms\" in Feb 1996 and \"Blessed By Sabbath\" in March 1997 which led them to gain underground metal press attention and label interest."
