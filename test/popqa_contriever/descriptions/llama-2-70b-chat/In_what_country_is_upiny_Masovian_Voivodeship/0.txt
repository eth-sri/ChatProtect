It lies approximately south of Koma\u0144cza, south of Sanok, and south of the regional capital Rzesz\u00f3w. The village has a population of 390. The village emerged when the local railway station was built in 1872, along the line from Zag\u00f3rz to then-Hungarian-owned Slovakia (First Hungarian-Galician Railway, \"Erste Ungarisch-Galizische Eisenbahn\"). At first, its inhabitants were mostly working on the railways."
