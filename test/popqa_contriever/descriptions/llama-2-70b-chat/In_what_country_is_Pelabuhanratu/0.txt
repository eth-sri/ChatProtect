  "context": "Sundanese locals say that the Indian Ocean is the home of Nyai Loro Kidul who reigns along the southern coast of Java. The current port has been improved to become an ocean fishing port with investment of Rp.415 billion ($48.8 million) on a 17-hectare area expansion. The project was initialized in September 2011. The Pelabuhan Ratu's white sands beach is a popular vacation destination for visitors from Sukabumi, Bogor, Bandung and Jakarta. However, because of high rolling waves, some spots on the beach are considered too dangerous for swimming."
