  "context": "A Brand New Day (album) A Brand New Day is the tenth overall album of gospel singer Vanessa Bell Armstrong, and first for Tommy Boy Gospel, a then-recently started imprint of the Tommy Boy Records label. Though relegated to traditional gospel production on her last two releases for Jive/Verity, \"New Day\" sees Armstrong return to the urban contemporary R&B sound that marked her mainstream gospel hits such as \"You Bring Out The Best In Me\" and \"Pressing On.\" \"Jesus I'll Never Forget\" was released to radio as the initial single from the set."
