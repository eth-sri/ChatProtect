  "context": "report describes the sudden bankruptcy of the Republican National Committee, and the simultaneous receipt of large anonymous donations by Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and the United Negro College Fund. Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes first conceived the idea for \"Sneakers\" in 1981, while doing research for \"WarGames\". In early drafts, the character of Liz was a bank employee, rather than Martin's ex-girlfriend. The role was changed because Lasker and Parkes believed that it took too long for her character to develop."
