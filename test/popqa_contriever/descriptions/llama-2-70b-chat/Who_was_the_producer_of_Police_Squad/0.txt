  "context": "Police Squad! Police Squad! is an American television comedy series broadcast on the ABC network in 1982, created by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker, and starring Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin. A spoof of police procedurals, the series featured Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's usual sight gags, wordplay and non sequiturs. While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the Lee Marvin cop show, \"M Squad\" (especially the opening credits) and the late 1960s series \"Felony Squad\". Although cancelled after six episodes, the show spawned \"The Naked Gun\" film series."
