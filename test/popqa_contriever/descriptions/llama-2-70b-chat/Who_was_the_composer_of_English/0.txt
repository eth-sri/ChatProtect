  "context": "He mentioned English composer John Dunstaple (c. 1390\u20131453) as the key figure and as a major influence on the major Burgundian composers Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois. It is not clear exactly what Martin le Franc saw as the elements of the Contenance Angloise. Musicologists have noted the style as a distinctive form of melodic polyphony that used full, rich harmonies based on the third and sixth, which may have made lyrics easier to articulate."
