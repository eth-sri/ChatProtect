  "context": "The Three Robbers The Three Robbers is a children's book by Tomi Ungerer. There was a 6-minute animated adaptation released in 1972 by Gene Deitch. The book was adapted as a full-length anime feature film by Hayo Freitag, released in mid-2007 as \"Die Drei Rauber\". This was adapted into a French version called \"Les Trois Brigands\" then an English one called \"Trick or Treaters\", which removed the original narration by Tomi Ungerer along with cutting out some of the original movie to shorten it and shoe-horned in a Halloween theme with the new narrator."
