  "context": "Out of This World (Johnny Mercer song) \"Out of This World\" is an American popular song composed by Harold Arlen, with lyrics written by Johnny Mercer. It was first recorded by Jo Stafford with Paul Weston and his Orchestra in 1944. It was introduced in the film \"Out of This World\" (1945) by Bing Crosby dubbing in for the voice of the main character played by Eddie Bracken. Alec Wilder describes the Arlen melody as creating a modal feeling (E-flat Dorian) that achieves an unearthly effect."
