  "context": "they were definitely interested. Jack was told to expand the first draft from 40,000 words to 90,000, but when the project was moved to another department he was told to then shorten it to 70,000. Only a few people Heath knows (one being his brother Tom) have a copy of the 90,000 word edition. \"The Lab\" was released on 1 April 2006, and was published by Pan Macmillan Australia. It was published in the US by Scholastic Corporation on November 1, 2008."
