  "context": "American Dreamer (film) American Dreamer is a 1984 American romantic comedy-thriller film starring JoBeth Williams and Tom Conti. It was directed by Rick Rosenthal from a script by Ann Biderman, David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf. It follows an American housewife (Williams) who wins a trip to Paris in a mystery-writing contest. She loses her memory when she is hit by a car, and begins acting as if she were the female detective in her story. A voice over says, \"No, that's not right.\" The scenario is repeated with adjustments until the voice is eventually satisfied."
