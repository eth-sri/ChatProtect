  "context": "in January 2000, during an interview with CNN.com, Toni revealed that the album was going to be released in March 2000, while stating, \"Some of the producers on the album are, of course Babyface, R. Kelly, David Foster, Keith Crouch and Keri Lewis of Mint Condition, just to name a few,\" while also revealing collaborations with Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes from TLC and Dr. Dre. \"The Heat\" is built on solid ballads and smoldering, mid-tempo dance numbers, as noted by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine."
