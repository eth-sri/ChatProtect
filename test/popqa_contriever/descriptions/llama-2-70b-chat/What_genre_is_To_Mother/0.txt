It was their debut single and was performed live on January 13, 1999, a week prior to the release of their first album \"Chapter 1\". The song is categorized as either hip hop or R&B but contains verses which are rapped by Danny Ahn and a chorus sung as a soulful ballad. The lyrics are narrated from the first-person viewpoint of the child, who is now grown up and is telling the story in retrospect."
