  "prompt": "What genre is Memorial?",
  "text": "Memorial, the album by Russian Circles, can be classified as post-metal, a subgenre of heavy metal music. The band's sound is characterized by a blend of heavy, distorted guitar riffs and intense drumming, contrasted with soft, atmospheric moments. The use of clean vocals and ambient soundscapes also adds a sense of depth and complexity to their music, which is in line with the post-metal genre.",

  "context": "\"Memorial\" is more \"polarizing\" between heavy and soft parts than previous efforts, and that the \"heavy parts are much more blown out and exaggerated while the pretty moments are far more restrained, delicate, and atmospheric.\" Cook also described the album as being darker and more somber than previous efforts. Inspired by Pink Floyd's 1977 album \"Animals\", \"Memorial\"'s album structure features the similarly composed intro/outro songs \"Memoriam\" and \"Memorial\" to make the album start and end in the same place. \"Memorial\" received critical acclaim upon its release."
