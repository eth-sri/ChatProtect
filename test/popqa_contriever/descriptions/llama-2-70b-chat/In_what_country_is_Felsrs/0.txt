The chief monument of the village is the romanesque church dating from the age of the \u00c1rp\u00e1dian kings. It was founded in the 11th century by a local landowner family for the provostry of priests. The richly carved stones refer however to royal donator of the ancient romanesque church. The western tower was erected first."
