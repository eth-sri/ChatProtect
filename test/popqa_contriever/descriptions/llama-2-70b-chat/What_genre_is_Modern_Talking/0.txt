  "text": "Modern Talking's sound evolved over their career, but they are primarily associated with the synthpop and Eurodance genres. During their initial run from 1984 to 1987, their sound was more mellow and closer to Europop, while after their reunion in 1998, they shifted to a more uptempo and danceable Eurodance sound.",

  "context": "Modern Talking discography This is the discography of the German synthpop duo Modern Talking. The duo have released their materials over a period of two separate time tables, first between 1984-1987, then the duo found itself reunified in 1998 and made a successful comeback releasing another batch of materials between 1998-2003. Modern Talking's sound; however, was rather different from their original 1980s sound after their reunion. The duo came back in 1998 switching from their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to 1990s uptempo Eurodance sound, which was in high demand in central Europe at the time."
