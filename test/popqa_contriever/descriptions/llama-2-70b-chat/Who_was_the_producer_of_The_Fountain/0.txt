  "context": "productions were recorded in New York at Sanders Recording Studios, and released on 12\" LP records with low press runs. Fountain's main co-star was a Brooklyn-based actor named Sandor Weisberger, who also usually served as announcer for the productions. A small entourage of local actors occasionally played lead or walk-on roles. Fountain and Weisberger were reunited in 1995 by radio station WFMU. The pair were interviewed, and they performed live (and without rehearsal) a new radio drama scripted the prior day by station listener Don Brockway."
