  "context": "Charops of Epirus Charops or \"Charopus\" is the name of two statesmen in 2nd century BC of the Epirote League, grandfather and grandson; both of them had the patronymic \"Machatas\". The grandfather sided with the Romans in their war with Philip V of Macedon, and, by sending a shepherd to guide a portion of the Roman army over the heights above the position of the Macedonians, enabled Flamininus to dislodge Philip from the defile which he had occupied in Epirus in 198 BC."
