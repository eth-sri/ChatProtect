  "context": "The Fruits of Enlightenment The Fruits of Enlightenment, aka \"Fruits of Culture\" (1889-90, pub. 1891) is a play by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. It satirizes the persistence of unenlightened attitudes towards the peasants amongst the Russian landed aristocracy. In 1891 Constantin Stanislavski achieved success when he directed the play for his Society of Art and Literature organization. Tolstoy created the first, incomplete draft of the play in 1886, along with \"The Power of Darkness\". Three years later, his children and wife persuaded him to complete the manuscript sufficiently for a house performance in Yasnaya Polyana."
