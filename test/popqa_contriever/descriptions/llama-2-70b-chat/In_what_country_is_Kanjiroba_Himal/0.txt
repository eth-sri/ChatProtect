  "context": "Kanjiroba Himal The Kanjiroba Himal is an isolated part of the Himalaya range within Nepal, adjacent to the Tibetan border. The region remained unmapped until the 1950s, when British explorer John Baird Tyson made the first of a series of expeditions to the area. The highest peak is Kanjiroba with a summit elevation of 6,883 meters above sea level. Kanjiroba Himal is within the cross-border Shey Phoksundo National Park, about 180 kilometres north-west of Pokhara. The region is high mountains, cut into by glaciers and deep, precipitous river valleys."
