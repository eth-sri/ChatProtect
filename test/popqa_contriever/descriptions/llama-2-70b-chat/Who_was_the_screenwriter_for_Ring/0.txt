  "prompt": "Who was the screenwriter for Ring?",
  "text": "The screenwriter for \"Ring\" is not specified in the given text. The text mentions Ring Lardner Jr. as the writer of several screenplays, including \"Woman of the Year,\" \"Laura,\" \"Brotherhood of Man,\" \"Forever Amber,\" and \"M*A*S*H,\" but it does not mention a screenwriter for a film called \"Ring.\" It is possible that \"Ring\" is not a film that Lardner worked on, or that he did not have a screenwriter for the film. Can you provide more context or clarify which \"Ring\" you are referring to?",
