  "context": "Cornelis Bloemaert Cornelis Bloemaert II (1603 \u2013 28 September 1692), was a Dutch Golden Age painter and engraver. Bloemaert was born at Utrecht. He studied with his father, Abraham Bloemaert, his brothers Hendrick and Adriaan, and his father's pupil, Gerard van Honthorst. Though originally trained as a painter, he devoted himself primarily to printmaking, which he learned from Crispijn van de Passe. He went to Paris in 1630, where he made engravings from among others, Michel de Marolles's \"Temple des Muses\", before going to Rome in 1633."
