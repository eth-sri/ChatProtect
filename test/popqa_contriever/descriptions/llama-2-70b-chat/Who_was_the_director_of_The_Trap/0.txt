  "context": "The Trap (1985 film) The Trap (), also known as Collector's Item, Dead Fright and The Cage, is a 1985 erotic thriller directed by Giuseppe Patroni Griffi (his last theatrical film), and starring Tony Musante, Laura Antonelli, and Florinda Bolkan. Famed Italian horror director Lucio Fulci contributed to the screenplay (this film was done during the time Fulci was recovering from hepatitus, so he was unable to direct it). The film is based on a story called \"L'Occhio\", written by filmmaker Francesco Barilli."
