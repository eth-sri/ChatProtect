Leaving the BBC to work as an independent producer, Marks was invited back by Alan Yentob and eventually became Head of Music Programmes at the BBC. During this time he became involved in opera, including directing television versions of Michael Tippett's \"New Year\" and Mark-Anthony Turnage's \"Greek\"."
