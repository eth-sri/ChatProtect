  "context": "Hot Rats Hot Rats is the second solo album by Frank Zappa. It was released in October 1969. Five of the six songs are instrumental; the other, \"Willie the Pimp\", features vocals by Captain Beefheart. It was Zappa's first recording project after the dissolution of the original Mothers of Invention. In his original sleeve notes, Zappa described the album as \"a movie for your ears\". Because \"Hot Rats\" largely consists of instrumental jazz-influenced compositions with extensive soloing, the music sounds very different from earlier Zappa albums, which featured satirical vocal performances with extensive use of musique concr\u00e8te and editing."
