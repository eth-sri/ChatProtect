  "context": "M\u00e1el Snechtai of Moray M\u00e1el Snechtai of Moray (or M\u00e1el Snechtai mac Lulaich) was the ruler of Moray, and, as his name suggests, the son of Lulach, King of Scotland. He is called on his death notice in the Annals of Ulster, \"M\u00e1el Snechtai m. Lulaigh ri Muireb\" (=\"M\u00e1el Snechtai, Lulach's son, King of Moray\"), which is a significant terminological development, since previously the titles for the ruler of Moray had either been \"King of Scotland\" or \"Mormaer.\" The title is repeated for his successor, \u00d3engus (if indeed the latter were his successor)."
