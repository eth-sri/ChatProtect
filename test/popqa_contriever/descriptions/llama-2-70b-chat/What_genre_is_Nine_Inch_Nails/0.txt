  "context": "entire second half of the three-minute long \"The Great Destroyer\". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: \"guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.\" Lyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in \"Year Zero\"."
