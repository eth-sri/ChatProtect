  "prompt": "Who is the mother of Jesus?",
  "text": "According to the Synoptic Gospels, the mother of Jesus is Mary, also known as Maria or Mariam in Greek. However, some scholars argue that the mother of Jesus mentioned in the crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts in the Synoptics is not the same person as the mother of Jesus, but rather a different Mary, such as Mary the mother of James and Joseph. They base this argument on the fact that the writers of the Synoptics refer to her as \"the other Mary\" and use a different form of the name Mary (Maria) than they do for the mother of Jesus (Mariam).",

  "context": "\"Mary the mother of James and Joseph\" and the \"other Mary\" in Jesus' crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts in the Synoptic Gospels. Proponents of this identification argue that the writers of the Synoptics would have called this Mary, simply, \"the mother of Jesus\" if she was indeed meant to be the mother of Jesus, given the importance of her son's crucifixion and resurrection: they also note that the mother of James and Joses is called \"Maria\", whereas the mother of Jesus is \"Mariam\" or \"Marias\" in Greek."
