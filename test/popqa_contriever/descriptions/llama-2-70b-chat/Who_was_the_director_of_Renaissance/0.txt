  "prompt": "Who was the director of Renaissance?",
  "text": "Renaissance was not a single person, but a theatre company founded by Kenneth Branagh and David Parfitt in 1987. Therefore, there was no single director of Renaissance, but rather a collaborative effort between the company's members and the directors of the individual productions. The directors mentioned in the passage are Judi Dench, Geraldine McEwan, and Derek Jacobi, who each made their directing debuts with Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road.",

  "context": "Renaissance received no public funding, it partnered in 1988 with John Adams and the Birmingham Rep on a touring season of plays launched as \"Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road\", with three classical actors making their directing debuts: Judi Dench with \"Much Ado About Nothing\"; Geraldine McEwan with \"As You Like It\"; and Derek Jacobi with Hamlet, which featured Branagh in the title role. After a UK tour and an August stop-over at Elsinore, the three productions were seen in a London repertoire season at the Phoenix Theatre."
