  "context": "in Quebec and established Lord as a major director with this, his third feature. Lord's wife, and co-screenwriter, the actress Lise Thouin released \"Bingo\", written by Michel Conte as a single. Bingo (1974 film) Bingo is a 1974 French-Canadian thriller directed by Jean-Claude Lord. The plot relates to Quebec's October Crisis of 1970. Director Jean-Claude Lord exploits the post-October Crisis paranoia that was rampant in Quebec with considerable panache with this skilful melodrama. Although the story is not about the events leading up to the War Measures Act, it does draw upon the fabric and feelings of that time."
