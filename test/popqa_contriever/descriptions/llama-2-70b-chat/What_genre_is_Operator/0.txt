  "context": "Operator (band) Operator is an American post-grunge band from Los Angeles, California, United States. The name Operator was used for a solo project created by Johnny Strong, an Actor/Musician/Martial Artist, who has appeared in movies such as \"Black Hawk Down\", (2001) \"The Fast and the Furious\" (2001), \"Get Carter\" (2000) and \"The Glimmer Man\" (1996). The first Operator album, \"Can You Hear Me Now\" (2003), was a self-released demo, and is very hard to find as well as sold out on the band's website. But soon, it attracted the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed Operator in 2007."
