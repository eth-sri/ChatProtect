  "context": "Higher and Higher (The Moody Blues song) \"Higher and Higher\" is the opening track of The Moody Blues 1969 album \"To Our Children's Children's Children\", a concept album about space travel. The verses of the song are spoken by Mike Pinder, rather than sung. Sound effects of a rocket launching begin the song and last for the first minute. \"Higher and Higher\" was also the Moody Blues' first full length song that was written by the band's drummer Graeme Edge. Edge was usually the writer of short spoken-word interludes that appeared at the beginning and end of previous albums."
