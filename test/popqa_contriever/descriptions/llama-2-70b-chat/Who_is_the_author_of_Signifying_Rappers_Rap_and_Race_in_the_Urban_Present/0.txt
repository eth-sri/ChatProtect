  "context": "Signifying Rappers Signifying Rappers: Rap and Race in the Urban Present is a nonfiction book by Mark Costello and David Foster Wallace. The book explores this music's history as it intersects with historical events, either locally and unique to Boston, or in larger cultural or historical contexts. The title is based on the track \"Signifying Rapper\" on the album \"Smoke Some Kill\" by Schoolly D. The teasing, taunting, and insulting tradition within African American culture is referred to as \"signifyin'\", though the word's other meanings are perhaps reflected in Costello and Wallace's title. Henry Louis Gates Jr."
