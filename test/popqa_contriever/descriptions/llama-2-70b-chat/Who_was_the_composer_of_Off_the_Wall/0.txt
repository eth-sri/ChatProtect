  "context": "it \u2013 Rod's arrangements, his tunes, his songs \u2013 was exceedingly hip,\" recalled Swedien, also calling Temperton: \"the most disciplined pop music composer I've ever met. When he comes to the studio, every musical detail is written down or accounted for in Rod's mind. He never stops until he feels confident that the music we're working on is able to stand on its own\". In 1979, Temperton was recruited by Quincy Jones to write for what became Michael Jackson's first solo album in four years, and his first full-fledged solo release for Epic Records, titled \"Off the Wall\"."
