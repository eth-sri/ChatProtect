  "context": "singer Latimore recorded \"Stormy Monday\" in 1973. His rendering of the song as an uptempo, jazz-influenced piece evokes a 1962 recording by Lou Rawls that was included on Rawls' \"Stormy Monday\" album with Les McCann. However, according to music writer David Whiteis, \"its propulsive, pop-tinged groove and Latimore's own jubilant vocal directness made this incarnation of the classic entirely his own\". The song was not initially promoted as a potential hit single; however, radio audiences responded so positively that it became his first major hit."
