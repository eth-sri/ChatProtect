  "context": "have been a daughter of the English king Edward the Elder (\u00c6lfgifu who married \"a prince near the Alps\"), though the evidence for this is weak. His second wife was Emma of M\u011bln\u00edk. It is certain the Boleslaus's oldest son was born by Adiva, but the mother of the others cannot be established with certainty: Soon after his father's death, Boleslaus III entered into conflict with his brothers and was deposed in 1002. The internal struggles of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty shook the Bohemian duchy, until Duke Old\u0159ich's efforts stabilised the country."
