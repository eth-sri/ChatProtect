  "context": "Serge-Simon Held Serge-Simon Held (credited as S.S. Held) was a French science fiction author known for the 1931 environmentalist novel \"La Mort du Fer\" (published in English as \"The Death of Iron\"). Very little is known about Held. He may have been from Alsace or of Alsacian descent, with many people from the region fleeing to Paris in 1870 due to the Alsacian cession to Germany following the Franco-Prussian war. The professor of English Frederick Waage was unable to find a record of Held, but noted that \"Held\" is frequently used as an ornamental surname among Jews."
