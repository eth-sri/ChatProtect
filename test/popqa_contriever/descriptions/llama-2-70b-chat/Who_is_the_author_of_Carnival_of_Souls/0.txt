  "context": "Carnival of Souls (Buffy novel) Carnival of Souls is an original novel based on the U.S. television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". A traveling carnival arrives in Sunnydale. It seems the carnival might be another victim of Sunnydale's weirdness. Nobody seems to be able to remember it arriving despite the many old-style wagons, the numerous performers, and horse-drawn carts. The creepy calliope music seems almost to beckon out to people. Also nobody who goes into Hall of Mirrors comes out exactly the same as they were to start with."
