  "context": "Lewis Carroll\u2019s \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" as well as several books by L. Frank Baum, author of \"The Wizard of Oz\". Taylor's wife, Emma Bonner Taylor, wrote the musical pieces that appear throughout the book. Compared to \"Alice in Wonderland\", Taylor's \"The Well in the Wood\" was hailed a children\u2019s classic at its second Knopf printing. The title comes from the old adage \"truth lies at the bottom of a well\"."
