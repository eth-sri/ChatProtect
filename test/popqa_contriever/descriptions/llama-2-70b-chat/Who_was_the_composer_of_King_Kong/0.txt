  "context": "films. Steiner's score for \"King Kong\" modeled the method of adding background music into a movie. Some of his contemporaries did not like his music. Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa criticized Steiner for his use of Mickey Mousing and did not like his music. However, R\u00f3zsa conceded that Steiner had a successful career and had a good \"melodic sense\".
