  "prompt": "What is the religion of Abraham Lincoln?",
  "text": "The religion of Abraham Lincoln is a matter of debate among historians and scholars. While some people who knew him personally, such as Chaplain of the Senate Phineas Gurley and Mary Todd Lincoln, believed that he was a Christian, others, such as Ward Hill Lamon and William Herndon, rejected this idea. Lincoln himself issued a statement during his 1846 run for the House of Representatives that he had \"never denied the truth of the Scriptures,\" but this does not necessarily mean that he considered himself a Christian in the classical sense. Ultimately, the question of Lincoln's religious beliefs remains a mystery, as he never publicly professed a specific faith.",

However, close friends who had known Lincoln for years, such as Ward Hill Lamon and William Herndon, rejected the idea that he was a believing Christian. During his 1846 run for the House of Representatives, in order to dispel accusations concerning his religious beliefs, Lincoln issued a handbill stating that he had \"never denied the truth of the Scriptures\"."
