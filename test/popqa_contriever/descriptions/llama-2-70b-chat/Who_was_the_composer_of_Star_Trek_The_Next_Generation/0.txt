  "context": "crew members walking about their parking lot and matted the footage onto the top of the saucer to represent the Starfleet personnel evacuating the saucer section. Dennis McCarthy, a composer who had worked on \"The Next Generation\", was given the task of composing for the feature. Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. The film's opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space."
