  "context": "indicates a combination of the three main religions \u2013 Confucianism, Taoism, and Chinese Buddhism. Together, they represent not only the unification of the three main religions but also the humility of God who presents himself as the lowest rank of Divinity. Caodaists adopt the traditional Chinese idea of \"\u00e2m\" (yin) and \"d\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (yang) duality constituting the harmonious balance of the universe. Before the creation of the universe there was the \"dao\", the infinite, nameless, formless, unchanging, eternal source. The negative and positive principles of the universe are the components of the eternal nature."
