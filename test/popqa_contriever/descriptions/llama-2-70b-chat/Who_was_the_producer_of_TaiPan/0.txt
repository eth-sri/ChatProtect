  "context": "Tai-Pan (film) Tai-Pan is a 1986 film directed by Daryl Duke, loosely based on James Clavell's 1966 eponymous novel. While many of the same characters and plot twists are maintained, a few smaller occurrences are left out. Filmed under communist Chinese censorship, some portions of Clavell's story were considered too offensive to be filmed as written and considerable changes were made. The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group handled the production and were actively seen battling the Chinese Government and Labor boards over the film during shooting. The results fared poorly at the box office and in critical reviews."
