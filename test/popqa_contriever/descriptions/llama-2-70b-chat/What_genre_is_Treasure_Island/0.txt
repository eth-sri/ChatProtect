  "context": "Treasure Island Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, narrating a tale of \"buccaneers and buried gold\". Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an \"X\", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders. \"Treasure Island\" was originally considered a coming-of-age story and is noted for its atmosphere, characters, and action. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels."
