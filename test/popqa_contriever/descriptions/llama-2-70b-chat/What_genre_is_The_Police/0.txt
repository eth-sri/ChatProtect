  "context": "Police started as a punk rock band, but soon expanded their music vocabulary to incorporate reggae, pop and new wave sonorities to their sound. In his retrospective assessment Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic argues that the notion of The Police as a punk rock band was true only \"in the loosest sense of the term\". He states the band's \"nervous, reggae-injected pop/rock was punky\" and had a \"punk spirit\" but it \"wasn't necessarily punk\". A \"power trio,\" the Police are known as a new wave and post-punk band, with many songs falling in the reggae-fusion genre."
