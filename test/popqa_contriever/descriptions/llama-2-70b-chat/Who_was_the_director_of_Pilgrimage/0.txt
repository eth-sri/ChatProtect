  "context": "five pilgrimages, he was appointed director of the Ampleforth pilgrimage. In 1991 he became a \"titulaire\" of the Hospitalit\u00e9 Notre Dame de Lourdes. Green resigned the directorship of the Ampleforth pilgrimage after the 1995 pilgrimage. The reason for this was because he would have been unable to continue to participate in the pilgrimage after he had relocated to St Benet's Hall, Oxford.

During the period before his death he served as the pilgrimage's spiritual advisor."
