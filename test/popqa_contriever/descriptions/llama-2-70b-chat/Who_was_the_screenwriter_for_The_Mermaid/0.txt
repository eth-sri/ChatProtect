  "context": "Hans Christian Andersen's original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s. That year Clements and Musker expanded the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating the role of the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and \"Oliver & Company\" as more immediate releases."
