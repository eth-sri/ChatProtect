  "context": "1992 Thomas took the next step in her directing career with her feature debut \"Only You\". A slight, playful romantic comedy; \"Only You\" was a departure from Thomas's experience on \"Hill Street Blues\" or her subsequent television directing. Wayne Rice, the film's producer and screenwriter, said that Thomas was chosen to direct due in part to the film's plot in which a man is on a hapless quest to find the perfect woman would be considered inherently sexist without a female director. Three years following the release of \"Only You\" Thomas directed \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" (1995)."
