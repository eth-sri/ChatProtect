  "context": "Deathstalker II Deathstalker II, also known as Deathstalker II: Duel of the Titans, is a 1987 Argentine-American fantasy adventure film and sequel to 1983's \"Deathstalker\". The film was directed by Jim Wynorski, written by Neil Ruttenberg, and starring John Terlesky and Monique Gabrielle. Terlesky replaced Rick Hill, the protagonist from the previous film, in the starring role of Deathstalker. This is the last sword and sorcery movie that Roger Corman produced in Argentina during the 80's. Owing to its low-cost production and the perceived self-awareness of the movie, Wynorski called the film an \"anachronistic comedy of sorts\"."
