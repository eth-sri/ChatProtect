  "context": "American television show filmed in color in Europe. Following the cancellation of \"Blue Light\", its first four episodes, which told a continuous story of David Marchs efforts targeting a German super-weapon facility at Grossmuchen, Germany, were edited together to create a movie. Entitled \"I Deal in Danger\", it was released theatrically in the United States in December 1966 and in other countries in 1967 and 1968. \"Blue Light\" was violent by the standards of television in the mid-1960s; in situations where other television heroes knocked out guards and other opponents, March knifed them to death."
