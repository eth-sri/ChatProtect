  "prompt": "What is the religion of Jesus in Islam?",
  "text": "In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is referred to as \"al-Masih\" or \"the Messiah.\" Muslims believe that Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as \"Injil\"). However, Muslims also believe that the original message of Jesus was lost or altered over time, and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Therefore, Muslims do not recognize the Christian religion as the authentic teachings of Jesus, and instead view Islam as the complete and final revelation of God's will.",

Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim."
