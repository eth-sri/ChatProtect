  "context": "came from producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. (the son of Paramount CEO Frank Mancuso, Sr.) as he began to resent the series due to how he felt nobody respected him for working on \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" as an production assistant and \"Part III\" as producer, regardless of how much money the films earned. As a result of this and him wanting to work on different projects, he wanted to conclude the series by killing off Jason. The filmmakers wanted Joseph Zito, who had previously worked on \"The Prowler\", to direct and write the screenplay for the film."
