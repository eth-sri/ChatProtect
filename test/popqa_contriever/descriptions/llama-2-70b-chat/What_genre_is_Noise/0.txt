  "prompt": "What genre is Noise?",
  "text": "Noise music is a genre that emerged in the 1960s and is characterized by the use of unconventional sounds and noise as musical elements. It is often associated with avant-garde and experimental music, and can encompass a wide range of styles and subgenres. Some common subgenres of noise music include:\n\n* Noise rock\n* Noise pop\n* Noise folk\n* Noise electronics\n* Harsh noise wall\n* Power electronics\n* Industrial music\n* Musique concrete\n* Electronic music\n* Experimental music\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"noise music\" can also be used more broadly to describe any music that challenges conventional musical norms and incorporates elements of noise, dissonance, and sonic experimentation. As such, it is not always a single, well-defined genre, but rather a collection of diverse musical styles and approaches that share a focus on sonic experimentation and pushing the boundaries of what is considered \"music.\"",

  "context": "their political and cultural leaders. Noise music (also referred to simply as noise) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently. Some of its proponents reject the attempt to classify it as a single overall genre, preferring to call noise music a \"non-genre\", an \"aesthetic\", or a collection of genres. Even among those who regard it as a genre, its scope is unclear. Some commentators use the phrase \"noise music\" (or \"noise\") to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term Japanoise."
