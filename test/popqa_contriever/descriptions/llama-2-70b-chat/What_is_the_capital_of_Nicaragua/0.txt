  "context": "was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Le\u00f3n had been the capital of Nicaragua since colonial times. So naturally, when Nicaragua withdrew from the United Provinces of Central America in 1839, Le\u00f3n became the capital of the new nation. For some years, the capital shifted back and forth between Le\u00f3n and the city of Granada. Liberal administrations preferred Le\u00f3n while Conservative administrations preferred Granada, until as a compromise, Managua was agreed upon to be the permanent capital in 1852. In 1950, the city of Le\u00f3n had a population of 31,000 people."
