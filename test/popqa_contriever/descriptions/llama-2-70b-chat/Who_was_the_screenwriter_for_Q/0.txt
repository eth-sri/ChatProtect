  "context": "the character Q as when she wrote her draft, it was unclear whether it would be a single or double episode. She had her work on the episode \"The Naked Now\" credited to the pseudonym J Michael Bingham. Her relationship with Roddenberry became so strained prior to her departure that she began tape-recording their conversations. After she left, she put in a claim with the Writers Guild that she had also worked as a story editor on the series, but was never paid for it. This was settled amicably with Paramount Television."
