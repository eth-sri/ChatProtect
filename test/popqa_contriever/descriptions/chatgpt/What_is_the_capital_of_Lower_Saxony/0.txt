In fact, Lower Saxony borders more neighbours than any other single \"Bundesland.\" The state's principal cities include the state capital Hanover, Braunschweig (Brunswick), L\u00fcneburg, Osnabr\u00fcck, Oldenburg, Hildesheim, Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Wolfsburg, and G\u00f6ttingen. The northwestern area of Lower Saxony, which lies on the coast of the North Sea, is called East Frisia and the seven East Frisian Islands offshore are popular with tourists."
