The first lyrics were written in 1918 by Ballard MacDonald and the music by Robert A. \"Bobo\" King, who used the pseudonym Mary Earl. The melody is partly based on \"Song of India\" by Rimsky-Korsakov and \"Beautiful Dreamer\" by Stephen Foster. The original 1918 publication also featured a second obbligato voice using the tune Love's Old Sweet Song."
