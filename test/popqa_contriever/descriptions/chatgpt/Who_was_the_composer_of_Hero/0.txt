  "context": "A Hero's Song A Hero's Song (), Op. 111, B. 199, also called Heroic Song for Orchestra, is a symphonic poem for orchestra composed by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k between August 4 and October 25, 1897. It was premiered in Vienna in on December 4, 1898, with Gustav Mahler conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, and was later published in Berlin in 1899. Unlike Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's other symphonic poems, this work is not based upon a specific text, and it may have been intended to be autobiographical. The piece is mostly energetic and triumphant, but it includes a slower section containing a funeral march."
