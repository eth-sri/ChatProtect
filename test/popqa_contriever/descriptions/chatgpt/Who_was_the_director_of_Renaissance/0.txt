  "context": "Renaissance received no public funding, it partnered in 1988 with John Adams and the Birmingham Rep on a touring season of plays launched as \"Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road\", with three classical actors making their directing debuts: Judi Dench with \"Much Ado About Nothing\"; Geraldine McEwan with \"As You Like It\"; and Derek Jacobi with Hamlet, which featured Branagh in the title role. After a UK tour and an August stop-over at Elsinore, the three productions were seen in a London repertoire season at the Phoenix Theatre."
