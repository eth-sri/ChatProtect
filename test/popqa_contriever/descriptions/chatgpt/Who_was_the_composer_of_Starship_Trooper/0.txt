  "context": "Starship Trooper \"Starship Trooper\" is a song written by British musicians Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Chris Squire, which first appeared on Yes' 1971 album \"The Yes Album\". The song is in three parts, \"Life Seeker\", \"Disillusion\" and \"W\u00fcrm\" . \"Life Seeker\" was released as a single on the b-side of the UK release of \"Your Move\". Anderson was aware of the title of \"Starship Troopers\", the 1959 novel by Robert A. Heinlein, and from that got the idea of a \"Starship Trooper being another guardian angel and Mother Earth\"."
