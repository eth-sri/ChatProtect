He captured and killed Incan emperor Atahualpa, and claimed the lands for Spain. Francisco Pizarro was born in Trujillo, C\u00e1ceres, Spain (then in the Crown of Castile) in modern-day Extremadura, Spain. He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446\u20131522) and Francisca Gonz\u00e1lez, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1474."
