Under the Director, The 100 changed its name to The 1000, where it is attempting to expand their reach to even the Oval Office with Henry Ballard as the presidential candidate. This plan, however, was thwarted and The 1000 became The 100 again upon retreating into the shadows. As The 1000 they fought Booster Gold. The 100 appears in \"Black Lightning\". Known members include Tobias Whale, Syonide, Joey Toledo, Latavius \"Lala\" Johnson, and Painkiller/Khalil Payne."
