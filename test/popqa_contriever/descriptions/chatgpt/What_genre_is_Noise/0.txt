  "text": "Noise music is often referred to as a \"non-genre\" or an \"aesthetic,\" and it is considered a collection of genres. Some commentators use the phrase \"noise music\" or \"noise\" to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term Japanoise. Therefore, it is not a specific genre but rather a broad term that encompasses different forms of experimental and avant-garde music.",

  "context": "their political and cultural leaders. Noise music (also referred to simply as noise) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently. Some of its proponents reject the attempt to classify it as a single overall genre, preferring to call noise music a \"non-genre\", an \"aesthetic\", or a collection of genres. Even among those who regard it as a genre, its scope is unclear. Some commentators use the phrase \"noise music\" (or \"noise\") to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term Japanoise."
