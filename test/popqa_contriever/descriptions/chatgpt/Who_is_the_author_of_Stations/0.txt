  "context": "Stations (poetry collection) Stations is a poetry collection by Seamus Heaney, who received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. It was published in 1975. This particular collection presents a style of writing which was then new to Heaney, known as \"verse paragraphs\" or prose poems. He believed this style of poetry was his own invention, but halfway through writing the collection, while teaching in an American university in 1971, English poet, Geoffrey Hill published a collection of poetry called \"Mercian Hymns\", which were presented in this style of \"prose poems\"."
