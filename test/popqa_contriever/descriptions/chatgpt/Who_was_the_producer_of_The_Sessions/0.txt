  "text": "There is some debate over who the official producer of The Sessions album was. Some sources credit John Cale as the creative producer, while others attribute the technical production to Norman Dolph and John Licata. Ultimately, it seems that there was no one individual with complete control or authority over the album beyond paying for the recording sessions.",

  "context": "or authority over the album beyond paying for the recording sessions. In fact, several other individuals who worked on the album are often mentioned as the album's technical producer. Norman Dolph and John Licata are sometimes attributed to producing the Scepter Studios sessions, considering they were responsible for recording and engineering them (despite the fact that neither of the two were ever mentioned in the original album's credits). Dolph himself, however, says John Cale was the album's rightful creative producer, as he handled the majority of the album's musical arrangements."
