  "context": "Assumption of Mary The Assumption of Mary into Heaven (often shortened to the Assumption) is, according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life. The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary \"having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory\". This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950, in the apostolic constitution \"Munificentissimus Deus\" by exercising papal infallibility."
