  "context": "Duchy of Amalfi The Duchy of Amalfi (, ) or the Republic of Amalfi () was a \"de facto\" independent state centered on the Southern Italian city of Amalfi during the 10th and 11th centuries. The city and its territory were originally part of the larger \"ducatus Neapolitanus\", governed by a patrician, but it extracted itself from Byzantine vassalage and first elected a duke (or doge) in 958. During the 10 and 11 centuries Amalfi was estimated to have a population of 50,000 -70,000 people."
