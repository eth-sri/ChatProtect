  "context": "the city is home of two of the country's oldest professional football teams: Aston Villa F.C., which was founded in 1874 and plays at Villa Park; and Birmingham City F.C., which was founded in 1875 and plays at St Andrew's. Rivalry between the clubs is fierce and the fixture between the two is called the Second City derby. Aston Villa are 7-time First Division champions and the 1982 European Champions, but currently play in the Championship following their relegation from the Premier League in the 2015\u201316 season. Birmingham City also currently play in the Championship."
