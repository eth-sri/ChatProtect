  "context": "Joint European Torus JET, the Joint European Torus, is the world's largest operational magnetically confined plasma physics experiment, located at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire, UK. Based on a tokamak design, the fusion research facility is a joint European project with a main purpose of opening the way to future nuclear fusion grid energy. JET was one of a number of tokamak reactors built in the early 1980s that tested new design concepts. It was one of only two designed to work with a real deuterium-tritium fuel mix, the other being the US-built TFTR."
