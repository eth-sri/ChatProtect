Meanwhile, he became convinced of the truth of a prophecy that stated, \"There will be two more emperors after Changming.\" (\"Changming\", which meant \"dawn,\" was the courtesy name of Emperor An's father Emperor Xiaowu.) He therefore became resolved to kill Emperor An, and he tried several times to have Emperor An's servants poison him, but because Emperor An's brother Sima Dewen continuously attended to him, the servants had no chance to poison him."
