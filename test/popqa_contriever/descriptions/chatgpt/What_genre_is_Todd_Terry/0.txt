  "context": "Todd Terry Todd N. Terry (born April 18, 1967) is an American DJ, record producer and remixer. Terry's productions extensively used samples blending the sounds of classic disco, the Chicago sound, and elements of hip-hop. Terry began in the 1980s by DJing at parties in New York, playing Italo disco and hip-hop - then later, house music, upon its mid-80s emergence. He debuted, as Masters at Work, with the 12-inch, \"Alright Alright\" (1987, Fourth Floor) and an edit from this was then included on the Chicago house vanguard compilation \"Jackmaster 1\" (1987, D.J. International)."
