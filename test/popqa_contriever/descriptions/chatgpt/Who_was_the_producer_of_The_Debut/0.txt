  "context": "Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had produced albums by Soul II Soul, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor and Massive Attack, which made Bj\u00f6rk skeptical about working with him, stating: \"I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But then I met him, got to know him, [and] got to hear about his fabulous ideas.\" Bj\u00f6rk and Hooper's recording ideas were similar, which led to her decision to end production with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Bj\u00f6rk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries, who gave \"Debut\" a modern style with keyboards and synthesizers."
