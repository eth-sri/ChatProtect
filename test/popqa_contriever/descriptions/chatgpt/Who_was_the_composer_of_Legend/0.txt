  "context": "Legends (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k) Legends, Op. 59, B. 122 (), is a cycle of ten small-scale pieces by the Czech composer Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. The work was composed originally for piano duet, but later was arranged also for a reduced orchestra. On 15 October 1880, the day before finishing the score of his sixth symphony, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote to his publisher Fritz Simrock about his plans for the near future saying he hoped to finish a piano duet cycle, \"Legends,\" in the next month. He did not, however, begin to sketch the work until 30 January 1881."
