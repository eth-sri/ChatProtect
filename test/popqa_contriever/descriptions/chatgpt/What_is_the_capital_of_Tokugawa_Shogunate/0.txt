  "context": "Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was transferred from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to Kant\u014d region. When he became \"sh\u014dgun\" in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century. But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not capital of Japan. (That was caused by the Meiji Restoration in 1868.) The Emperor himself lived in Kyoto from 794 to 1868 as capital of Japan."
