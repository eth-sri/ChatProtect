One of the judges, June Purvis, professor of women's and gender history at Portsmouth University, said: \"This is an extremely readable, lively book that explores the complex personal and political relationship between two great male politicians who helped to shape 20th-century Britain. The changing shades and hues of their relationship are documented in fascinating detail.\" It received widespread critical acclaim from a number of newspaper reviews for its \"nuanced\" approach."
