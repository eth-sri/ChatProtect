  "context": "Squeeze (Squeeze album) Squeeze is the self-titled debut album released by British group Squeeze. The album title was simply \"Squeeze\" in the United Kingdom, but in the United States, Canada, Australia and other countries the album, like the band, was marketed under the name U.K. Squeeze to avoid confusion with similarly named American and Australian groups. The LP was produced by John Cale, except for \"Take Me I'm Yours\" and \"Bang Bang\" (also the only singles released from the LP). Those songs were produced by the band."
