  "context": "Suicide (book) Suicide () is an 1897 book written by French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim. It was the first methodological study of a social fact in the context of society. It is ostensibly a case study of suicide, a publication unique for its time that provided an example of what the sociological monograph should look like. According to Durkheim, In his view, suicide comes in four kinds: These four types of suicide are based on the degrees of imbalance of two social forces: social integration and moral regulation."
