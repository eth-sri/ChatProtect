  "context": "Les Vingt et un Jours d'un neurasth\u00e9nique Les Vingt et un Jours d'un neurasth\u00e9nique is an expressionist novel by the French writer Octave Mirbeau, published by Charpentier-Fasquelle in August 1901. It's a collage of fifty cruel tales already published in the press over the previous fifteen years. So Mirbeau unsettles traditional novelistic conventions, transgressing the code of fictional credibility and maintaining indeterminacy of its genre affiliation. A fictionalized rendering of the author\u2019s sojourn a few years before at the Pyrenean spa of Luchon, the novel mirrors a vagrant plot in its episodic narrative."
