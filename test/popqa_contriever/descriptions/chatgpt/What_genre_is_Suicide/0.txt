  "context": "Suicide (band) Suicide was an American musical duo intermittently active between 1970 and 2016, composed of vocalist Alan Vega and instrumentalist Martin Rev. The group's pioneering music utilized minimalist electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers and primitive drum machines, and their early performances were confrontational and often ended in violence. They were among the first acts to use the phrase \"punk music\" in an advertisement for a concert in 1970. Though never widely popular among the general public, Suicide have been recognized as among the most influential acts of their era."
