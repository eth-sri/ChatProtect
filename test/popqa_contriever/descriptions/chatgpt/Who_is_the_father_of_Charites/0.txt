  "prompt": "Who is the father of Charites?",
  "text": "There is no definitive answer to this question as there are several different mythological traditions that mention different fathers for the Charites (also known as the Graces). In some versions, they are said to be the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Eurynome, while in others they are the offspring of Dionysus and Aphrodite, or of Hera and Hephaestus. Some versions also suggest that they were born from the union of Oceanus and Tethys, or of Helios and the ocean nymph Aegle. Ultimately, the parentage of the Charites may depend on the specific myth or tradition being considered.",

  "context": "Charops of Epirus Charops or \"Charopus\" is the name of two statesmen in 2nd century BC of the Epirote League, grandfather and grandson; both of them had the patronymic \"Machatas\". The grandfather sided with the Romans in their war with Philip V of Macedon, and, by sending a shepherd to guide a portion of the Roman army over the heights above the position of the Macedonians, enabled Flamininus to dislodge Philip from the defile which he had occupied in Epirus in 198 BC."
