Thematically, it is similar to an early series by the same team, \"Crossfire\", published by Eclipse Comics, but without the superhero element. The series featured the adventures of Jerry Naylor, a stunt coordinator disillusioned the film industry, Melody, an aspiring actress trying break into the business and Leo Haney, a good natured stand up comedian."
