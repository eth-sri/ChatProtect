  "context": "Lagoon (novel) Lagoon is an Afrofuturist novel by Nnedi Okorafor (2014, Hodder & Stoughton; 2015, Saga Press/Simon & Schuster). It quickly drew scholarly attention after its publication. According to Hugh Charles O'Connell: \"Lagoon\" develops its ... narrative across three acts: \"Welcome\" (in which the aliens make contact with the people of Lagos), \"Awakening\" (an explosion of violence across the city after contact is made), and \"Symbiosis\" (a period of utopian transformation, in which the aliens and humans come together to form a new postcapitalist Nigeria)."
