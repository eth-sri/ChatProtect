  "context": "president Lloyd Braun, who envisioned a series that was a cross between the novel \"Lord of the Flies\", the movie \"Cast Away\", the television series \"Gilligan's Island\", and the popular reality show \"Survivor\". Braun had titled his concept \"Lost\" after a failed reality show that had broadcast in 2001. Writer Jeffrey Lieber was contacted by Spelling's vice president of series development Ted Gold, and in September 2003 pitched to ABC the concepts for what he called \"Nowhere\". Sherman approved the idea and hired Lieber to write a script, but Braun wound up rejecting Lieber's draft and subsequent rewrites."
