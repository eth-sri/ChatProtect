  "context": "All by Myself \"All by Myself\" is a song by American artist Eric Carmen released in 1975. The verse is based on the second movement (\"Adagio sostenuto\") of Sergei Rachmaninoff's \"Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor\", Opus 18. The chorus is borrowed from the song \"Let's Pretend\", which Carmen wrote and recorded with the Raspberries in 1972. The power ballad was the first single from Carmen's first solo LP after leaving the power pop group the Raspberries and was released in December 1975, to great acclaim."
