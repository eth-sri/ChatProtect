  "context": "woman who attempts to abort her unborn child is criticised. The female perspectives within the novel is rare in war fiction and provides a larger sense of the domestic repercussions. Critic Ronald Paul notes that \"Regeneration\" and its sequels are some of the first novels since Rebecca's West's \"The Return of the Soldier\" or Virginia Woolf's \"Mrs. Dalloway\" that deal with the repercussions of the war and whose author was not a male soldier. Paul describes such novels, which deal explicitly with domestic effects of shell shock, as part of Barker's self-described \"very much female view of war\"."
