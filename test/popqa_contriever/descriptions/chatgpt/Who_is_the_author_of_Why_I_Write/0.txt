  "context": "Why I Write \"Why I Write\" (1946) is an essay by George Orwell detailing his personal journey to becoming a writer. It was first published in the Summer 1946 edition of \"Gangrel\". The editors of this magazine, J.B.Pick and Charles Neil, had asked a selection of writers to explain why they write. The essay offers a type of mini-autobiography in which he writes of having first completed poems and tried his hand at short-stories, and carried on a continuous \"story\" about himself in his head, before finally becoming a full-fledged writer."
