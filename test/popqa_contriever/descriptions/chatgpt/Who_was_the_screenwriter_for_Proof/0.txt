  "context": "TV serial. \"Proof\" was created by Tony Philpott, who also wrote the first two episodes of the first series. \"Proof\" notably made headlines when it was discovered that Philpott's original screenplay had been \"dumbed down\" by network executives and some of the more politically critical elements had been removed. The screenplay was read by a \"Sunday Times\" TV critic, who noted the excisions and wrote about them in an article separate to his TV column. The column, printed on February 1, 2004, wrote: \"It could almost be the plot of a whodunit."
