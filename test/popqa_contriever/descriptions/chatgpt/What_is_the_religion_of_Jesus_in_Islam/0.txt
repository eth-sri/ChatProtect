  "prompt": "What is the religion of Jesus in Islam?",
  "text": "In Islam, Jesus is regarded as a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is seen as a continuation of the monotheistic faiths that came before him, including Judaism and Christianity. Muslims believe that Jesus was sent to guide the Children of Israel, and that his message was one of submission to God. The religion of Jesus in Islam is essentially the same as the religion of all the prophets and messengers who came before him, which is to worship and submit to the one true God.",

  "context": "of God (\"Allah\") and the Messiah (\"al-Masih\") who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (\"Bani Isra'il\") with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as \"Injil\"). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim."
