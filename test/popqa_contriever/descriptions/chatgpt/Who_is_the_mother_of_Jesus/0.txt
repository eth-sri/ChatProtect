  "context": "\"Mary the mother of James and Joseph\" and the \"other Mary\" in Jesus' crucifixion and post-resurrection accounts in the Synoptic Gospels. Proponents of this identification argue that the writers of the Synoptics would have called this Mary, simply, \"the mother of Jesus\" if she was indeed meant to be the mother of Jesus, given the importance of her son's crucifixion and resurrection: they also note that the mother of James and Joses is called \"Maria\", whereas the mother of Jesus is \"Mariam\" or \"Marias\" in Greek."
