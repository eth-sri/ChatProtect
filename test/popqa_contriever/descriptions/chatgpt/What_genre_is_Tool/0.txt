  "context": "thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions.\" Tool has gained critical praise from the \"International Herald Tribune\"s C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound. Describing their general sound, AllMusic refers to them as \"grinding, post-Jane's Addiction heavy metal\", and \"The New York Times\" sees similarities to \"Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes\"."
