  "context": "Driver\" topped the list placing at No. 1. Schrader's screenplay for the film was ranked the 43rd greatest ever written by the Writers Guild of America. By contrast, Leonard Maltin gave a rating of only 2 stars and called the film a \"gory, cold-blooded story of sick man's lurid descent into violence\" which was \"ugly and unredeeming\". \"Taxi Driver\", \"American Gigolo\", \"Light Sleeper\", and \"The Walker\" make up a series referred to variously as the \"Man in a Room\" or \"Night Worker\" films."
