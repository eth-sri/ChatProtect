  "context": "Our Lady of the Flowers Our Lady of the Flowers (\"Notre-Dame-des-Fleurs\") is the debut novel of French writer Jean Genet, first published in 1943. The free-flowing, poetic novel is a largely autobiographical account of a man's journey through the Parisian underworld. The characters are drawn after their real-life counterparts, who are mostly homosexuals living on the fringes of society. The novel tells the story of Divine, a drag queen who, when the novel opens, has died of tuberculosis and been canonised as a result."
