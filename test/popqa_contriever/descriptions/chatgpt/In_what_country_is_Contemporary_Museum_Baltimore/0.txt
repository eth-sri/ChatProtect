  "context": "Contemporary Museum Baltimore The Contemporary is an itinerant museum of contemporary art in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States. It does not collect artworks. It was started as the Contemporary Museum by George Ciscle in 1989. During its first decade, it had no fixed home, but instead was \"dedicated to redefining the concept of the museum\". It sponsored exhibitions in a variety of non-traditional spaces around Baltimore, as well as borrowing space in partnering institutions such as the Baltimore Museum of Art, Maryland Historical Society, Peabody Conservatory and Walters Art Museum."
