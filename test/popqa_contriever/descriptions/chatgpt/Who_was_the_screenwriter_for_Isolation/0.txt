The film was released direct to DVD on 26 June 2007. Dan Reilly, a farmer working in rural Ireland, is propositioned by a local bio-genetics firm to assist in some experiments to make faster-growing cattle. The experiments go awry and one of Dan's cows births a calf that is already pregnant with six malformed fetuses with fangs and exoskeletons."
