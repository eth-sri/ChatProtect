  "context": "points out the robe is too big. The musical score for \"Rocky\" was composed by Bill Conti, who previously composed a score for director John G. Avildsen's \"W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings\" (1975) that was ultimately rejected by the studio. In fact, David Shire (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for \"Rocky\" but had to turn it down due to prior commitments. Thus, Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio intervention due to the film's relatively low budget. \"The budget for the music was 25 grand,\" said Avildsen."
