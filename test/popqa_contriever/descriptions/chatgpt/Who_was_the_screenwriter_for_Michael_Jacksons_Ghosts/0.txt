  "context": "Michael Jackson's Ghosts Michael Jackson's Ghosts is a 1996 horror musical short film starring Michael Jackson, co-written by horror novelist Stephen King alongside Mick Garris and directed by film director and special effects guru Stan Winston which could also be classified as a long-form music video. It was filmed and first screened in 1996 and released along with select prints of the film \"Thinner\". It was released as promo a year later internationally on LaserDisc, VHS and Video CD, yet not on DVD or Blu-ray despite requests from fans of either Jackson, Winston, King or the horror genre."
