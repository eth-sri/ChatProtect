  "context": "Maria Margherita Grimani Maria Margherita Grimani (\"fl.\" 1713 \u2013 1718) was an Italian composer who, at some points in her life, was active in Vienna. Very little else about her is known. Among her compositions was the first opera by a woman to be performed at the Vienna court theater. She may have lived at the noble court for periods between 1713 and 1718; however, she was not employed at the court as a musician."
