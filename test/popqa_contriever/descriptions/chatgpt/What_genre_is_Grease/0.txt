  "context": "film version of \"Grease\" was a smash hit; its songs were original compositions done in a 1950s pop style. However, the sequel \"Grease 2\" (released in 1982) bombed at the box-office. Films about performers which incorporated gritty drama and musical numbers interwoven as a diegetic part of the storyline were produced, such as \"Lady Sings the Blues\", \"All That Jazz\", and \"New York, New York\". Some musicals made in Britain experimented with the form, such as Richard Attenborough's \"Oh! What a Lovely War\" (released in 1969), Alan Parker's \"Bugsy Malone\" and Ken Russell's \"Tommy\" and \"Lisztomania\"."
