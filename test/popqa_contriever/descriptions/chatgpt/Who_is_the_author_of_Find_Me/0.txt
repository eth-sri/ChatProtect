  "context": "Find Me (book) Find Me is a memoir written by comedian, actress, and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell. It was published in 2002. The book, which reached number two on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list, is, at heart, a remembrance of O'Donnell's troubled childhood. It also tells the story of O'Donnell's involvement with a woman who has multiple personality disorder who initially claims to be the mother of a pregnant 14-year-old girl and later that very girl and, even later on, the girl's father."
