  "context": "The Room (novel) The Room is the second novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., first published in 1971. The novel centers on a nameless petty criminal locked in a remand cell, and explores his feelings of impotence, hatred and rage, and fantasies of revenge. Selby described the critical reception of the book as \"the greatest reviews I've ever read in my life\", although in reality it was not well received. The novel was regarded by Selby as the most disturbing book ever written, and Selby stated that he himself was unable to read it again for 20 years."
