  "context": "The Information (novel) The Information is a 1995 novel by British writer Martin Amis. The plot involves two forty-year-old novelists, Gwyn Barry (successful) and Richard Tull (not so). Amis has asserted that \"both\" characters are based (if they can be regarded as based on anybody) on himself. It is, says Amis, a book about \"literary enmity\". Gwyn Barry and Richard Tull have been friends since they roomed together at university. Richard Tull was a promising writer with a seemingly bright future."
