  "context": "it was \"important people understand that the movie isn't the series\", and so the project was titled \"Serenity\". After Universal acquired the film rights from Fox, Whedon began writing the screenplay. His task was to explain the premise of a television series that few had seen without boring new viewers or longtime fans. He based his story on original story ideas for \"Firefly\"s un-filmed second season. Whedon's original script was 190 pages, and attempted to address all major plot points introduced in the series."
