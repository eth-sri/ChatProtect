  "context": "Canterbury Park and Ride Canterbury Park and Ride is a park and ride system operated by Stagecoach in East Kent in the English historic cathedral city of Canterbury. It was designed to reduce pollution in the city centre. The Park and Ride scheme was launched in 1991. It was initially operated by the East Kent Road Car Company using three single-deck vehicles; the company was taken over by the Stagecoach Group in 1993. The service was then run by Stagecoach until 2008, when it was taken over by council-owned operator Kent Top Travel."
