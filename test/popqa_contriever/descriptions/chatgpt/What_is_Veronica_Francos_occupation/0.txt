  "context": "Veronica Franco Veronica Franco (1546\u20131591) was an Italian poet and courtesan in 16th-century Venice. Renaissance Venetian society recognized two different classes of courtesans: the \"cortigiana onesta,\" the intellectual courtesan, and the \"cortigiana di lume,\" lower-class prostitutes who tended to live and practise their trade near the Rialto Bridge. Veronica Franco was perhaps the most celebrated member of the former category, although she was hardly the only \"onesta\" in 16th-century Venice who could boast of a fine education and considerable literary and artistic accomplishments."
