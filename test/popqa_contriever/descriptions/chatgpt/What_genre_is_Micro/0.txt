  "context": "Micro (novel) Micro is a techno-thriller novel by Michael Crichton, published posthumously in 2011. Upon his death in 2008, an untitled, unfinished manuscript was found on his computer, which would become \"Micro\" and complete his two-book deal with publisher HarperCollins. HarperCollins chose science writer Richard Preston to complete the novel from Crichton's remaining notes and research, and it was finally published in 2011. \"Micro\" is Crichton's second posthumous novel; \"Pirate Latitudes\", a historical thriller, was also found on his computer and published posthumously in 2009."
