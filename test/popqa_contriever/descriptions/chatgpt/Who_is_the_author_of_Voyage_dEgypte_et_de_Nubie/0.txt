  "context": "Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie (1755) records Frederic Louis Norden's extensive documentation and drawings of his voyage though Egypt in 1737\u201338. It contains some of the very first realistic drawings of Egyptian monuments and to this day remains a primary source for the looks of Egyptian monuments before widespread 19th and 20th century tourism and excavations. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, under order of Frederick V of Denmark, first published the book in 1755."
