  "context": "Gentleman in Black\", was based on the theatrically popular theory of metempsychosis. Gilbert and Frederic Clay had collaborated previously on a one-act opera, \"Ages Ago\". The music was not published and is now lost. The piece was never revived in Gilbert's lifetime, although modern performances have been given, some adapting Sullivan music. The libretto is included in \"Original Plays by W. S. Gilbert in Four Series\", in the fourth volume in the series (1911) published by Chatto and Windus of London. From the mid-1860s through the early 1870s, W. S."
