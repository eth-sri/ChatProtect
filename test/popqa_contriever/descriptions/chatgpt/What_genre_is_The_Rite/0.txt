It is loosely based on Matt Baglio's book \"The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist\", which itself is based on real events as witnessed and recounted by American then-exorcist-in-training Father Gary Thomas and his experiences from being sent to Rome to be trained and work daily with veteran clergy of the practice. The film stars Anthony Hopkins, Colin O'Donoghue, Alice Braga, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, and Rutger Hauer."
