Klein went on to adopt the title of Candyman in his Candyman Kitchens business once his non-compete clause was up following sale of the Jelly Belly copyright. The film heavily features David Klein and his son Bert Klein, but also includes interviews from then partner and supplier Herman Goelitz Candy Company (now renamed Jelly Belly) as well as Weird Al Yankovic."
