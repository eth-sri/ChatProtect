  "context": "The Good Life (band) The Good Life is an indie rock band on Saddle Creek records. Started as a solo project of Cursive's frontman Tim Kasher, The Good Life quickly grew to become its own established group. The original intent of The Good Life was to provide Tim Kasher with a vehicle to perform songs that did not fit stylistically in with his long-running band Cursive. Kasher fronts the group and plays the part of the singer/songwriter. The other members of the band include Stefanie Drootin, Ryan Fox, and Roger Lewis."
