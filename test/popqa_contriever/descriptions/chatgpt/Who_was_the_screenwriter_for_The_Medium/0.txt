  "context": "never-before-seen works that Carol Serling found in her garage. The first was an outline called \"The Theatre\" that Richard Matheson expanded. The second was a complete script written by Serling, \"Where the Dead Are\". More than 30 years after his death, Serling was digitally resurrected for an episode of the TV series \"Medium\" that aired on November 21, 2005. Filmed partially in 3-D, it opened with Serling's introducing the episode and instructing viewers when to put on their 3-D glasses."
