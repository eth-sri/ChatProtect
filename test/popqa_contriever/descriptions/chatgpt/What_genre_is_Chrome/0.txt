  "context": "features atypical for this kind of game, some of which were inspired by \"System Shock 2\" and \"Deus Ex\" that utilize more RPG mechanics. There is a wide array of items that the player can pick up, this not only includes weapons, ammo and health packs but also food or even CD players which have no practical purpose (but can be used to play short music loops). Inventory space is limited and the items are being managed on an inventory screen similar to those seen in \"System Shock 2\" and \"Deus Ex\"."
