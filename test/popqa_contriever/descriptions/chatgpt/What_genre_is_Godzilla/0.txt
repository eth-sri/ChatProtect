  "context": "Godzilla (franchise) The first film, \"Godzilla\", was directed by Ishir\u014d Honda and released by Toho in 1954 and became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by Akira Ifukube, which was reused in many of the later films. The original also introduced the work of special effects master Eiji Tsuburaya, who used miniatures and \"suitmation\" to convey the large scale of the monster and its destruction."
