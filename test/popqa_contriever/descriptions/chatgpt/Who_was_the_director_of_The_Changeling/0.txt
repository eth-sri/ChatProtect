  "context": "director hired for the project. His predecessors, Donald Cammell and Tony Richardson, both withdrew due to \"creative differences\". Medak was hired with only a month to facilitate script re-writes and set construction. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote in his review of the film: \"If it only took craftsmanship to make a haunted house movie, \"The Changeling\" would be a great one. It has all the technical requirements, beginning with the haunted house itself... [the film] does have some interesting ideas... But it doesn't have that sneaky sense of awful things about to happen."
