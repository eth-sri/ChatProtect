  "context": "\"hirpos\" (cfr. Hirpini) originally male goat instead of expected \"*lupos\", whence also \"herpex\" for \"hirpex\" tool in the shape of wolf teeth. In fable Faunus appears as an old king of Latium, grandson of Saturnus, son of Picus, and father of Latinus by the nymph Marica (who was also sometimes Faunus' mother). After his death he is raised to the position of a tutelary deity of the land, for his many services to agriculture and cattle-breeding. A goddess of like attributes, called Fauna and Fatua, was associated in his worship. She was regarded as his daughter, wife, or sister."
