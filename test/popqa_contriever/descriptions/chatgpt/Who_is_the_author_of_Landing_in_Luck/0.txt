  "context": "Landing in Luck \"Landing in Luck\" was William Faulkner's first published short story. Appearing in the November 26, 1919 issue of \"The Mississippian\", a literary magazine at the University of Mississippi, \"Landing in Luck\" tells the story of Cadet Thompson, who is sent on a solo flight without adequate instruction. Thompson lands successfully, and his flight instructor, Bessing, takes credit for the fine job he did of teaching the cadet pilot. It is a fictional exaggeration based on Faulkner's experience as a cadet-pilot for the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1918."
