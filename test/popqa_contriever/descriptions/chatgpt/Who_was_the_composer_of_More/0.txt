  "context": "Margaret More (composer) Margaret More (26 June 1903 \u2013 1966) was a British composer. Margaret More, often called \"Peggy\", was born in 1903 to English parents William and Alice More in Crown Lodge in Harlech, North Wales. Her interest in music showed early, but she was not an infant prodigy. It became clear that her main concern was composition; she had no interest whatever in a career as a performer. She was educated at home by a governess, who gave her a grounding in musical theory and encouraged her ambition."
