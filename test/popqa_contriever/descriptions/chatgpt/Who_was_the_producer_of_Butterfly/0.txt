Riklis had already funded \"Butterfly\", released that same year, to serve as vehicle for his wife Pia Zadora, and wanted \"The Lonely Lady\" to have the same purpose. Riklis was reportedly supplying approximately half of the film's $6-7 million budget, along with completion costs, but refused any mention in credits. Robert R. Weston, responsible for the previous Robbins adaptation \"The Betsy\", was the producer."
