It was remade as an explicit pornographic film by Joe D'Amato in 1995. In 1958, on the verge of the Merlin Law that makes brothels illegal, Mimma (Debora Caprioglio), a young country girl, comes to town and decides to work as a prostitute in order to help her fianc\u00e9 get the money to start their own business, and is given the name Paprika at Madame Collette's (Martine Brochard) house."
