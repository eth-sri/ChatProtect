Originally made as a modification of the Valve Corporation's \"Portal\" series, it was officially approved for sale by Valve and released on the software distribution platform Steam on July 15, 2014. The game lacks the iconic portal gun of the series and instead utilizes a newly created paint gun that fires two kinds of gel with different properties."
