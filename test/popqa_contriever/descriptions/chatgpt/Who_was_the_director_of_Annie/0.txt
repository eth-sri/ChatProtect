  "context": "both John Huston and Joe Layton while working as the director and choreographer respectively to also be executive producer on the film, because it was too large an enterprise for one person. Regarding Huston being given the job of directing the first (and what would be the only) musical in his 40-year directing career, screenwriter Carol Sobieski said: \"Hiring John [Huston] is an outsider risk, and Ray's [Stark] a major gambler. He loves this kind of high risk situation.\" Carol Sobieski, who wrote the screenplay, introduced major differences between the stage musical and the film version."
