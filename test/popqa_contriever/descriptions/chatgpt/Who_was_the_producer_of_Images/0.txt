  "context": "Images (film) Images is a 1972 British-American psychological horror film written and directed by Robert Altman and starring Susannah York and Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois. The picture follows an unstable children's author who finds herself engulfed in apparitions and hallucinations while staying at her remote vacation home. Conceived by Altman in the mid-1960s, \"Images\" secured financing in 1971 by Hemdale Film Group Ltd., and shot on location in County Wicklow, Ireland in the fall of that year. The script, which had been sparsely composed by Altman, was collaboratively developed further throughout the shoot with the actors."
