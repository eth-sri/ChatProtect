  "context": "Cossins were signed to reprise the roles they had played in the stage production. Original director Alvin Rakoff was replaced a week into filming after he clashed with Davis, who felt he \"didn't have the first fundamental knowledge of making a motion picture, let alone what an actor was all about\". Rakoff, an award-winning director who had steered quite a few actors to acclaimed performances (Laurence Olivier, Peter Sellers, etc.) countered: \"Not the most rational woman one can meet. But a great screen actress. She didn\u2019t want a director. She wanted someone enthralled to her. Initially I was."
