While working as an advertising executive in New York, he wrote a short story based on the early life of Al Jolson, called \"The Day of Atonement\", which he then converted into a play, \"The Jazz Singer\". This would become the first talking picture, with Jolson as its star. He then worked as a screenwriter with Ernst Lubitsch on sophisticated comedies like \"Trouble in Paradise,\" \"The Shop Around the Corner\", and \"Heaven Can Wait\", and with Alfred Hitchcock on \"Suspicion\"."
