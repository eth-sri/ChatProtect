  "context": "stream is located in the Gornji Grad - Medve\u0161\u010dak city district, running underground under Tkal\u010di\u0107eva and Medvedgradska Streets. The creek today plays a minor role in the Zagreb sewer system, having ceased powering the Mandu\u0161evac Fountain in 1882. However, it gave its name to the Medve\u0161\u010dak neighborhood. The stream's source is located on the Medvednica mountain, near Kralji\u010din zdenac. Therefrom it flows through a flood retention dam near the \u0160estinski Lagvi\u0107 restaurant, and onwards through the neighbourhood of Mlinovi (Croatian for \"mills\") in a concrete basin."
