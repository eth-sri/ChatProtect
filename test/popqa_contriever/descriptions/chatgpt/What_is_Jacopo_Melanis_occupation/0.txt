Along with Bernardo Pasquini and Alessandro Scarlatti, he was one of the leading composers active in Rome during the 17th century. He is also ranked among the second school of Roman opera composers which began with his brother's 1668 opera \"Il Girello\". He is chiefly remembered today for his large output of liturgical music that he wrote while serving in various musical posts in Rome."
