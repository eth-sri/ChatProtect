Brown grew up in Bond Street in Kingston, living two doors away from Duke Reid's \"Treasure Isle\" studio. Heavily influenced by U-Roy, but also citing Big Youth, Dennis Alcapone, Prince Jazzbo and I-Roy as influences, Brown began his career on the \"Silver Bullet\" sound system in the early 1970s, moving on to \"Sound of Music\" and replacing U-Roy on the \"King Tubby's Hi-Fi\" system in 1975."
