  "context": "My Way (Usher song) \"My Way\" is a 1998 single from Usher's 1997 album of the same name. It features an uncredited rap and background vocals from Jermaine Dupri. Despite moderate airplay, the single sold well and reached #2 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Its rise to #1, however, was halted due to the success of the mega-hit \"The Boy Is Mine\" by Brandy and Monica, during its 13-week run atop the summit. Due to the disappointment of the \"Nice and Slow\" single in the U.K., \"My Way\" was not released as a single there."
