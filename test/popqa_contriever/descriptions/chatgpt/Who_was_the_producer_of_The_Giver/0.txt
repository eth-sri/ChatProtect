In the years following, members of the partnership changed and the production team grew in size, but little motion was seen toward making the film. At one point, screenwriter Ed Neumeier was signed to create the screenplay. Later, Neumeier was replaced by Todd Alcott and Walden Media became the central production company. Diana Basmajian adapted the novel to full-length play format, and Prime Stage Theatre produced in 2006."
