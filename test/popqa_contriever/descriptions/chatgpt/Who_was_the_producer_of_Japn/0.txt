  "context": "Jap\u00f3n Jap\u00f3n () is a 2002 film by the Mexican director Carlos Reygadas. It was Reygadas' debut feature. The film follows a man going through an acute existential crisis. He leaves Mexico City to go out to the country and prepare for his death, staying with an old indigenous widow in her ramshackle home overlooking a desolate canyon. In the vastness of a wild and impressive nature, he confronts the infinite humanity of the widow and oscillates between cruelty and lyricism. His senses become dull, arousing his desires and instincts for sexuality and life."
