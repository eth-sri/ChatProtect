  "context": "Shocking Dark Shocking Dark (also known as Terminator II, Terminator 2, Aliens 2, Aliennators, and Contaminator) is a 1989 Italian science-fiction film written by Claudio Fragasso, produced by Franco Gaudenzi and directed by Bruno Mattei. Although the film was promoted as a rip-off of James Cameron's \"The Terminator\", it is actually mostly a rip-off of \"Aliens\", also by Cameron. Despite the film's original title and artwork presenting it as a sequel to 1984 film \"The Terminator\", it is not officially associated with that film. The plot has more in common with the 1986 film \"Aliens\"."
