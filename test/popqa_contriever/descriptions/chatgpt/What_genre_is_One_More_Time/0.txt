  "context": "One More Time (One More Time album) One More Time is the second album by the Swedish pop group One More Time and was released in 1994. The album did not continue the international success of the group's first album, and \"One More Time\" did not enter the Swedish charts at all. Since the record hasn't been re-released, it is today a collector's item and is quite difficult to find. Three songs were released as singles; \"Song of F\u00eate\", \"Get Out\" and \"The Dolphin\"."
