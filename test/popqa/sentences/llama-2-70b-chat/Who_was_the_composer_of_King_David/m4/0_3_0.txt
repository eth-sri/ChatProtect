However, it is believed that King David was a skilled musician and composer, and he is credited with composing many of the psalms in the Bible. The Psalms are a collection of hymns and songs that were written to honor God and to express praise, thanksgiving, and worship.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that many of the Psalms are attributed to King David and that he is believed to have composed them or had a hand in their composition. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically states that the Psalms were composed by King David himself, while statement 1 leaves open the possibility that they may have been composed under his direction. However, both statements support the idea that King David was a significant figure in the composition of the Psalms."
