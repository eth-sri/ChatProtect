  "prefix": " The composer of King David is unclear, as the biblical figure of King David lived over 3,000 years ago and there is limited historical information available about his life and reign. However, it is believed that King David was a skilled musician and composer, and he is credited with composing many of the psalms in the Bible. The Psalms are a collection of hymns and songs that were written to honor God and to express praise, thanksgiving, and worship.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of King David are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that King David is credited with composing many of the psalms in the Bible, with statement 2 providing a more specific estimate of how many psalms he may have written. Both statements also acknowledge that there is limited historical information available about King David's life and reign, which makes it difficult to definitively attribute all of the psalms to him. Overall, the statements provide complementary information about the role that King David played in the composition of the Psalms."
