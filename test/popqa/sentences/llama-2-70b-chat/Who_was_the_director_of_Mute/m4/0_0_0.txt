  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Mute? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Duncan Jones was the director of the movie Mute. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence, where the first statement uses the word \"directorisation\" which is not a commonly used word, while the second statement is a more straightforward and commonly used sentence structure."
