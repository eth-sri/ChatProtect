  "prefix": " The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) is a collection of Latin inscriptions from the Roman Empire, published in a series of volumes by the German Archaeological Institute (Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut, DAI) since 1863. The CIL was founded by Theodor Mommsen, who was a philologist and historian, and it has been edited by a number of scholars over the years. Therefore, it is not accurate to attribute the authorship of the CIL to a single person.",
