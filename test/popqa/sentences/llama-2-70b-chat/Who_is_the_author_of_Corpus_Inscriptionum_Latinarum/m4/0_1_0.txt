  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the CIL was founded by Theodor Mommsen, but statement 1 adds that it has been edited by other scholars over the years. Therefore, statement 1 provides additional information about the history of the CIL, but it does not contradict statement 2."
