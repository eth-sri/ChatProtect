  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Theodor Mommsen founded the CIL but it has been edited by various scholars over the years, while statement 2 claims that Mommsen compiled the CIL. \"Founded\" and \"compiled\" have different meanings, and therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
