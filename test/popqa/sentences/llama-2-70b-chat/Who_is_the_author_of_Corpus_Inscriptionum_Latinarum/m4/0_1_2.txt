  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the CIL was founded by Theodor Mommsen but has been edited by various scholars over the years, while statement 2 asserts that it was edited solely by Theodor Mommsen. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
