  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that the collection was published by the German Archaeological Institute, but does not mention the author. Statement 2 incorrectly attributes the authorship to Theodor Mommsen, who was one of the editors of the collection but not the sole author. The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum was a collaborative effort involving many scholars over several decades."
