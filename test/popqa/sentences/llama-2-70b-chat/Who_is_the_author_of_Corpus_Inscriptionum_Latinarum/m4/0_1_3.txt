  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that Theodor Mommsen founded the CIL and that it has been edited by various scholars over the years. Statement 2 is a partial statement and does not contradict Statement 1. It only mentions that the editing of the CIL began with Mommsen, which is true. Therefore, both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
