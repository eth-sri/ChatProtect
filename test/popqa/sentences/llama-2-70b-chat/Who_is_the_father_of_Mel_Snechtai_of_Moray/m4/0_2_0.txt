Statement 1 provides additional information about M\u00e1el Snechtai's family, specifically that he had a son named M\u00e1el D\u00fas who succeeded him as king of Moray. Statement 2 simply reiterates that the only information provided about M\u00e1el Snechtai's father is that he is not explicitly stated in the sources, but confirms that M\u00e1el Snechtai was indeed a king of Moray in the 8th century."
