  "explanation": "The statements about the father of M\u00e1el Snechtai of Moray are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that it is not clear whether M\u00e1el Snechtai's father was also a king of Moray or not, while Statement 2 asserts that M\u00e1el Snechtai's father was also a king of Moray. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present conflicting information about the same topic."
