Both statements provide the same information that the father of M\u00e1el Snechtai of Moray is not explicitly stated in the sources available. Statement 1 further adds that M\u00e1el Snechtai is listed as a king of Moray in the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach, but his father's name is not provided. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
