  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Operator? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Operator as a video game that combines different genres such as puzzle-adventure, interactive fiction, and psychological horror. \n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 describes Operator as a synth-pop band, which is a completely different genre from the first-person narrative game described in Statement 1. \n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, and they contradict each other."
