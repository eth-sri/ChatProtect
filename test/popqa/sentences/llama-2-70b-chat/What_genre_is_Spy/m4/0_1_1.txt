  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Spy? are not contradictory. Both statements describe Spy as a genre-bending film that combines elements of comedy and action with the spy genre. The only difference is that statement 1 also includes adventure as an element, while statement 2 includes espionage. However, both adventure and espionage are commonly associated with the spy genre, so the statements are still consistent with each other."
