  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Arkansas? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the music was composed by Charles A. Asbury, while Statement 2 claims that the lyrics were written by Mrs. Charles H. Mills. There is no mention of Charles A. Asbury in Statement 2, and no mention of Mrs. Charles H. Mills in Statement 1. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
