  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Company\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the Broadway premiere of the musical, including the year (1970), the director (Harold Prince), and the fact that Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics while Furth wrote the book. Statement 1 simply includes the premiere year and director information before mentioning Sondheim's involvement, while Statement 2 mentions Sondheim first before providing the premiere year and director information."
