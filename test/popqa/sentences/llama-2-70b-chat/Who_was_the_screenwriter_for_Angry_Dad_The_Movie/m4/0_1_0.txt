  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but rather they both support the initial statement that the question is based on a false assumption. The first statement clarifies that since Angry Dad: The Movie is a fictional film, it does not have a screenwriter. The second statement goes further to explain that the film does not even exist, making the question even more absurd. Therefore, both statements reinforce the idea that the question cannot be answered as it is based on false assumptions."
