The first statement claims that Angry Dad: The Movie is a fictional film and therefore does not have a screenwriter, while the second statement claims that the premise of the question is not valid. However, if the question is not valid, then it cannot be assumed that the movie is fictional or non-fictional, and therefore, it cannot be assumed whether or not it has a screenwriter."
