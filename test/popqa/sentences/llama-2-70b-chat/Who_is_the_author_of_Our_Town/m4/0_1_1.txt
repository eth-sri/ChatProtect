  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of Our Town are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the play and its significance, but they do not contradict the fact that Thornton Wilder is the author. Statement 1 provides the year of the play's first performance and its status as a classic of American literature and theater, while Statement 2 emphasizes its importance specifically in the realm of American theater."
