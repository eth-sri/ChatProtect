  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"In Summer\" are not contradictory. While the first statement mentions that the song was performed by Olaf and became popular, it does not contradict the fact that Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez were the composers of the song. The second statement, on the other hand, is incorrect as the song was not performed by Queen Elsa but by Olaf."
