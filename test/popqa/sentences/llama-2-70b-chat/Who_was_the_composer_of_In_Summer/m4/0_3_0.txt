Both statements provide additional information about Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez's involvement in the Frozen soundtrack, specifically their success in winning an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Let It Go.\" While the second statement repeats information about the same award, it emphasizes that \"Let It Go\" is a separate song from \"In Summer.\""
