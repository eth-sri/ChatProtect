  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for The Game are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Andrew Kevin Walker's career and style as a screenwriter, but they do not contradict the fact that he was the screenwriter for The Game. Statement 1 highlights his nationality and the genres he typically works in, while Statement 2 focuses on his writing style and themes. Together, they provide a more complete picture of Walker's background and approach to screenwriting."
