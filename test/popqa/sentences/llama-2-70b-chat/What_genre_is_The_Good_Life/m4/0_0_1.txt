Statement 1 provides a more detailed description of the game's genre, listing simulation, adventure, and role-playing games as categories it falls under. Statement 2 is a more concise answer, simply stating that The Good Life is a life simulation game. Both statements are accurate and provide different levels of detail about the game's genre."
