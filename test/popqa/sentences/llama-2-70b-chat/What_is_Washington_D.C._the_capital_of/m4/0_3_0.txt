  "explanation": "The two statements about What is Washington, D.C. the capital of? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state, which is a unique characteristic of the city. The first statement adds that this federal district serves as the capital of the United States and is the seat of the federal government, while the second statement simply states that Washington, D.C. is a federal district. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about the status of Washington, D.C. as the capital of the United States."
