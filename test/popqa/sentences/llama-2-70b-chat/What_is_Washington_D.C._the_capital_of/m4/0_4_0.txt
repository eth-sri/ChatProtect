  "explanation": "The statements about Washington, D.C. are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the city is home to many national landmarks and monuments, including the White House and the Lincoln Memorial. The only difference is that Statement 1 includes the Capitol Building, while Statement 2 includes the National Mall. However, both of these landmarks are also located in Washington, D.C. and are well-known tourist attractions. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about the city's significance as the capital of the United States."
