Both statements mention that the lyrics of The Message explore themes of life in the inner city, social inequality, and the struggles of urban youth. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions that these themes were key concerns of the hip hop movement in its early days, while statement 2 does not. However, this additional information does not contradict the fact that The Message is a hip hop album and a work of gangsta rap."
