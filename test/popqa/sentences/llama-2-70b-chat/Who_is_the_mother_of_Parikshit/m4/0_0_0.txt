  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who is the mother of Parikshit are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Uttara is the mother of Parikshit, while statement 2 claims that Queen Kunti is the mother. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other. It is important to note that in Hindu mythology, Parikshit is believed to be the son of Abhimanyu and Uttara, but Kunti is not mentioned as his mother."
