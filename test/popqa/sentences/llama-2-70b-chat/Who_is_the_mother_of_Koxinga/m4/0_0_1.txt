  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Koxinga are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information, with statement 1 giving more context about Princess Katsura's background before stating that she was Koxinga's mother, while statement 2 directly states that Princess Katsura was Koxinga's mother. Therefore, both statements confirm that Princess Katsura is the mother of Koxinga."
