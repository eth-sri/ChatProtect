  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Koxinga are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Koxinga's mother passed away when he was still a child, which would have been before 1644 (when Koxinga was 20 years old). However, statement 2 suggests that his mother passed away in 1678, which would have been after Koxinga's death in 1662. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
