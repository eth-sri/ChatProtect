  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the mother of Koxinga? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Koxinga's mother was Princess Katsura, a member of the Japanese royal family, while Statement 2 claims that Koxinga's mother was Princess HongNRou. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different names for Koxinga's mother. Therefore, they are contradictory."
