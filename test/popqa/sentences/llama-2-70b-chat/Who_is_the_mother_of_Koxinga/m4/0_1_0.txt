  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Koxinga are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about Princess Katsura's background, including her parents and reputation for beauty and intelligence. Statement 2 simply reiterates that she was a daughter of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, which was already mentioned in the beginning of the text. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Princess Katsura was Koxinga's mother."
