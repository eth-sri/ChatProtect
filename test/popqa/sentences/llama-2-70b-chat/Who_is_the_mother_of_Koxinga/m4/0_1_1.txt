Both statements agree that Koxinga's mother was Princess Katsura, a daughter of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, who was known for her intelligence and political influence. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions her beauty, while statement 2 emphasizes her political influence. However, both statements provide additional information about Koxinga's mother without contradicting each other."
