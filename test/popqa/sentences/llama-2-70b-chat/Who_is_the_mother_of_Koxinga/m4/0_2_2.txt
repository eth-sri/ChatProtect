  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Koxinga are contradictory. The first statement states that Koxinga's mother was Princess Katsura, a member of the Japanese royal family, while the second statement states that Koxinga was the son of Koxinga and his first wife, Lady Yao. It is not possible for Koxinga to have two different mothers. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
