Both statements confirm that Quincy Jones was the producer of the album \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson, and that he has also produced other successful albums for Jackson, including \"Off the Wall\" and \"Thriller.\" The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the album \"Dangerous\" in statement 2, which does not contradict the fact that Jones produced \"Bad.\""
