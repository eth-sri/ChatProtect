  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Rising? are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the director of the film \"Rising\" is named Kevin Macdonald, while statement 2 states that the director of the film \"Rising\" is named Russo brothers. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different names for the director of the same film. Therefore, they are contradictory."
