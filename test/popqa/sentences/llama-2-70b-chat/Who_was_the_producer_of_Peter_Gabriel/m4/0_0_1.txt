  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Peter Gabriel are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Bob Ezrin produced Peter Gabriel's self-titled solo album, while Statement 2 claims that Daniel Lanois produced Peter Gabriel's music. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they refer to different producers. Therefore, they are contradictory."
