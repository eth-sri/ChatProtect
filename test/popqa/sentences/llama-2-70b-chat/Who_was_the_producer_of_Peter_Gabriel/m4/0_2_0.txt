  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of Peter Gabriel are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Bob Ezrin produced \"PG2\" and \"PG3\", while Statement 2 claims that he produced \"PG2\" and \"So\". Since \"PG3\" is not mentioned in Statement 2, it is unclear whether Ezrin produced that album or not. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
