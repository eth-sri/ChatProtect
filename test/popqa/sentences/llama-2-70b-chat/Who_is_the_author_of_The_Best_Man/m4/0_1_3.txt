Both statements provide additional information about the play The Best Man, but they do not contradict the fact that Gore Vidal is the author of the play. Statement 1 provides information about the play's premiere on Broadway and its subsequent adaptation into a film, while Statement 2 simply reiterates the fact that the play was adapted into a film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner."
