  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Best Man? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Gore Vidal as the author of The Best Man, while Statement 2 appears to have a typographical error with the word \"Vidaluting\" which is not a known word or name. Therefore, Statement 2 is incorrect and contradicts Statement 1."
