  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Ward? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about John Carpenter's involvement in The Ward, with one emphasizing the film's significance as his return to the horror genre and the other highlighting the length of his hiatus from the genre. Together, they provide a more complete picture of Carpenter's role in the film."
