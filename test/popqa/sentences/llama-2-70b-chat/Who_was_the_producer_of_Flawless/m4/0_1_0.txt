The beginning of the text states that the producer is Beyonc\u00e9 and Nicky Minaj, while statement 1 implies that Beyonc\u00e9 alone was the producer as the song was released as a single from her album. Statement 2 does not provide any information about the producer, but it does not contradict the beginning of the text."
