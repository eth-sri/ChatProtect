  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of Unapologetic are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Stargate, composed of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen, produced the album. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that they have also produced hits for other artists such as Beyonc\u00e9, Katy Perry, and Selena Gomez, while statement 2 mentions Coldplay instead of Selena Gomez. However, this does not contradict the fact that Stargate produced Unapologetic for Rihanna."
