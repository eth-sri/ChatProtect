  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Unapologetic? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the producer of the album was Stargate, while Statement 2 claims that it was The-Dream & Cirkut. These are two different production duos, and therefore cannot both be the producer of the same album."
