  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of the Mario franchise are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the core of the franchise is based on platformer games, but also recognize that the franchise has expanded to include other genres such as racing, sports, and role-playing. Statement 1 provides specific examples of platformer games within the franchise, while Statement 2 emphasizes the classic platformers that are considered the foundation of the franchise. Overall, both statements support the idea that the Mario franchise is primarily a platform game series, but has also diversified into other genres."
