  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of the Mario franchise are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that the franchise is primarily a platform game series, but it has also included other genres. The second statement expands on this idea by mentioning the specific games that fall into those other genres, as well as the fact that the franchise has expanded beyond just video games into other forms of media. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the Mario franchise is primarily a platform game series, but it has also encompassed other genres and forms of media."
