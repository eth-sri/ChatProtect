  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Another World are contradictory. The first statement describes the game as a platformer with non-linear gameplay, while the second statement describes it as an adventure game. While platformers and adventure games can share some similarities, they are distinct genres with different gameplay mechanics and objectives. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
