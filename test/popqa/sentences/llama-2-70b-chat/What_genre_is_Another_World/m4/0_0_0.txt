  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Another World are not contradictory. The first statement describes the game as a platformer with non-linear gameplay set in a science fiction universe, while the second statement simply adds that it was developed by Eric Chahi. Both statements are consistent with the game being classified as a platformer with science fiction elements."
