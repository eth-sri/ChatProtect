  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Bouvet Island is not part of any country, while the second statement explains that it is a dependency of Norway. Being a dependency means that it is not an independent country, but rather a territory that is under the control of another country. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
