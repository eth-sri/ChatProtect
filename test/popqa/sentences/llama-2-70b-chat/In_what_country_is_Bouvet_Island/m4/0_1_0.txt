  "explanation": "The two statements about Bouvet Island are not contradictory. Although the first statement says that the island is not in any country, it goes on to explain that it is a dependency of Norway and part of the kingdom's territory. The second statement also confirms that Bouvet Island is an unincorporated territory of Norway. Therefore, both statements are consistent in identifying Norway as the country to which Bouvet Island belongs."
