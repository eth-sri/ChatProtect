  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who is the father of Edward I of Portugal are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that his father was King Afonso III of Portugal, while statement 2 claims that his father was King Alfonso X of Castile. These are two different individuals from different countries, so they cannot both be Edward's father."
