  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Genius? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Michael Grandage was the director of the movie, while statement 2 claims that Ron Howard was the director. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct, making the statements contradictory."
