Both statements describe the plot and characters of the film, but they do not contradict each other in terms of the genre. The first statement emphasizes the science fiction, action, and horror elements of the film, while the second statement provides a more specific plot summary that also fits within the science fiction and action genres. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the overall genre of Alien Terminator."
