  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Candy are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Michael Deeley was the producer, while statement 2 claims that Terry Southern was the producer. Both statements cannot be true at the same time. It is possible that one of the statements is incorrect or that there were multiple producers involved in the making of the film. Further research would be needed to determine the accurate information."
