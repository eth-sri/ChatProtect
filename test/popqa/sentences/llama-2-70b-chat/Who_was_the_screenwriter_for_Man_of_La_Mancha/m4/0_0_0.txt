  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Man of La Mancha are not contradictory. Both statements identify Dale Wasserman as the screenwriter for the 1972 film adaptation of the musical. The only difference is that the first statement also notes that Wasserman wrote the book for the stage musical."
