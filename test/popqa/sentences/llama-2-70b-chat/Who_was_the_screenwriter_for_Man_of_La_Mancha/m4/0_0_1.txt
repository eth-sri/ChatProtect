  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for Man of La Mancha are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Dale Wasserman as the screenwriter for the 1972 film adaptation of the musical, as well as the writer of the original stage book. The second statement adds that Wasserman also wrote the screenplay for another classic musical, \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" These statements provide complementary information about Wasserman's career as a screenwriter and do not contradict each other."
