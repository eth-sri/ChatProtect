  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Outfoxed are contradictory. The first statement states that Robert Greenwald was the director of Outfoxed, while the second statement states that the film was produced by Danny Schechter and Rory O'Connor. While producers play an important role in the creation of a film, they are not the same as the director, who is responsible for the creative vision and overall direction of the project. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
