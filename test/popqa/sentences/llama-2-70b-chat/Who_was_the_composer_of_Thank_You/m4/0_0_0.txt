  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Thank You? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the song \"Thank You\" was composed by John Farnham and David Hirschfelder, while Statement 2 claims that the song was composed by Led Zeppelin. These are two completely different answers to the same question, and cannot both be true. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
