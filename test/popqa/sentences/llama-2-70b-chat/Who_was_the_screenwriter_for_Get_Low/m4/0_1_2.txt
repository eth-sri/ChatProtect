  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Get Low are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Chris Provenzano was the screenwriter for the movie, and that he worked with the film's director, Aaron Schneider, to develop the screenplay. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 1 specifying that Provenzano wrote the screenplay based on a story they developed together, while statement 2 simply states that they developed the screenplay together."
