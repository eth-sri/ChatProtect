  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Passion of Anna are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Ingmar Bergman as the screenwriter for the film and provides some background information about him. The second statement adds to this information by stating that Bergman wrote over 60 screenplays throughout his career, which is not in conflict with the fact that he wrote the screenplay for The Passion of Anna. Additionally, the first statement mentions some of Bergman's other notable films, which is also not contradictory to his work on The Passion of Anna."
