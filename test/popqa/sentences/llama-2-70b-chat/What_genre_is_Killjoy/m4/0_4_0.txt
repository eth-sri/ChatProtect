  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Killjoy are not necessarily contradictory, as they both offer different perspectives on the genre classification of the character's story. Statement 1 focuses on the science fiction and dystopian elements of the story, while Statement 2 emphasizes the dark fantasy and horror aspects. Both statements acknowledge the character's association with punk and alternative rock music, but offer different interpretations of the genre of the story itself. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather complementary in their analysis of the genre of Killjoy."
