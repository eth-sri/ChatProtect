  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Killjoy are contradictory. The first statement suggests that Killjoy is a character in a music video and comic book, which would imply that it is a work of fiction in the realm of music or graphic novels. The second statement, however, suggests that Killjoy is a science fiction series, which would imply that it is a work of fiction in the realm of science fiction. These two genres are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but they are distinct enough that it is unclear how Killjoy could be both a music video/comic book character and a science fiction series."
