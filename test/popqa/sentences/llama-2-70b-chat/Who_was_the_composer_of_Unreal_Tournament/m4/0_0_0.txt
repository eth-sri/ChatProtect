  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Unreal Tournament are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the music was composed by a team of composers, while statement 2 identifies Michiel van den Bos as the sole composer. Therefore, it is not clear whether the music was composed by a team or by Michiel van den Bos alone."
