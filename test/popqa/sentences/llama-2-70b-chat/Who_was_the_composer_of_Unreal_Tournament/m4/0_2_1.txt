The first statement explains that the music was created by a team of composers, and the second statement provides a list of some of the composers who were part of that team, including Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, and Alexander Brandon. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the music for Unreal Tournament was a collaborative effort by multiple composers."
