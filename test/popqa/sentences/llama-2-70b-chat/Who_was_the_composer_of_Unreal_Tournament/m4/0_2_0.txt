  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Unreal Tournament? are contradictory. The first statement mentions a team of composers who worked on the game, while the second statement only lists three specific composers. While Michiel van den Bos is mentioned in both statements, the second statement does not include many of the other composers credited in the first statement. Therefore, the two statements provide different information about the composers of Unreal Tournament."
