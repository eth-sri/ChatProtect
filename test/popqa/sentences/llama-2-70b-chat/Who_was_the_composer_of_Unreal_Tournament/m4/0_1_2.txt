While the prompt asks for the composer of Unreal Tournament, the text clarifies that it was actually a team of composers who worked on the music for the game. Statement 1 further explains that these composers were audio professionals employed by Epic Games, the company that developed the game, which is also confirmed in statement 2. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the team of composers and the company behind Unreal Tournament, without contradicting each other."
