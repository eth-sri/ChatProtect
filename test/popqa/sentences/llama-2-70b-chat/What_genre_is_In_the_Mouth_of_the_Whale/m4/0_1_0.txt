  "explanation": "The statements about In the Mouth of the Whale are contradictory because statement 1 describes the plot and themes of the novel, while statement 2 provides information about the author and their background. The genre of a novel is determined by its style, themes, and literary techniques, not by the author's personal details. Therefore, the two statements do not provide conflicting information about the genre of the novel, but they are not directly related to each other."
