  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Stand? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Mick Garris as the director of the 1994 television miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's novel \"The Stand\". However, statement 2 is incorrect as Stephen King was not the director of The Stand. He is the author of the novel on which the miniseries is based, but he did not direct the adaptation."
