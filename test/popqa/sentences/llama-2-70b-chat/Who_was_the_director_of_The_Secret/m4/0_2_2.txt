The first statement establishes that Rhonda Byrne directed the film \"The Secret\" and that it was her directorial debut. The second statement provides additional information about the source material for the film, which is Byrne's book of the same name. It clarifies that the book was published in 2004, two years before the film's release. Therefore, the statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
