  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Bat? are not contradictory. Both statements mention Val Lewton as a real-life figure who may have inspired the character of Cousin C.C. Capades in the film. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that Lewton worked at RKO Pictures, while statement 2 simply mentions him as a film producer. However, this difference does not contradict the information provided in the text."
