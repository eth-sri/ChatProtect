  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of The Bat, Cousin C.C. Capades, are not contradictory. Both statements describe Capades as a wealthy and eccentric film producer who had a penchant for producing low-budget horror films and lived an opulent lifestyle. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions Capades' reputation for producing horror films, while statement 2 focuses more on his lifestyle. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Capades as an eccentric and wealthy film producer."
