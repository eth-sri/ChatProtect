  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Trap? are not contradictory. While the first statement acknowledges that the director is not explicitly stated, it provides information about the producer of the film, Oliver Stone. The second statement also provides information about the production company behind the film, which is not contradictory to the first statement. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the film's production without contradicting each other."
