  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Trap? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the director is not explicitly stated, while the second statement provides additional information about the film's context and its association with the French New Wave movement. The fact that the film was produced by Oliver Stone does not contradict the first statement, as producing a film does not necessarily mean directing it."
