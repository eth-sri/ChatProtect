  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Trap? are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges the lack of explicit information about the director of the film and suggests that Oliver Stone, who produced the film, may have also directed it. Statement 2 provides additional information about Oliver Stone's career as a director, suggesting that he may have directed other films in addition to The Trap. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Oliver Stone may have been the director of The Trap, but there is not enough information to confirm this with certainty."
