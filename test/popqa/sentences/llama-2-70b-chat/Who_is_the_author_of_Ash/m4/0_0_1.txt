  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Ash are contradictory. The first statement suggests that the author cannot be determined because a person's name is not a published work, while the second statement claims that the book was not written by a specific author. The first statement implies that there is an author, but their identity cannot be determined, while the second statement suggests that the book was created collaboratively or anonymously. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
