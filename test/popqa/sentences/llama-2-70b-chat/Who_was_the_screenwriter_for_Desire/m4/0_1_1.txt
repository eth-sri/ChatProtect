  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Desire\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Samuel Mintz wrote or co-wrote the scripts for over 100 films during his career, including \"The Public Enemy,\" \"Scarface,\" and \"The Women,\" while Statement 2 claims that he wrote \"It Happened One Night\" and \"The Thin Man.\" However, \"It Happened One Night\" and \"The Thin Man\" were not included in the list of notable titles mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, the two statements present different information about the extent of Mintz's screenwriting career."
