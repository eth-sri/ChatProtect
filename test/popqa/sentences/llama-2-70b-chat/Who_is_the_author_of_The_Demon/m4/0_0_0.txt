  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Demon? are contradictory because they provide different names for the author of the book. Statement 1 claims that the author is Hubert Selby Jr., while statement 2 claims that the author is Glen Cooper. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
