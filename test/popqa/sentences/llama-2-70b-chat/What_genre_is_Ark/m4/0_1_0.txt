  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Ark are not contradictory. While the initial text identifies Ark as belonging to the action-adventure and survival horror genres, the additional statements highlight other elements of the game that are also present. These elements, such as sandbox gameplay, open-world exploration, and crafting, do not contradict the initial genre classification but rather add to the overall description of the game. Therefore, the statements work together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genre of Ark."
