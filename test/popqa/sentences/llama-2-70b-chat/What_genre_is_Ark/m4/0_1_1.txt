  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement identifies Ark as belonging to the action-adventure and survival horror genres, the second statement simply adds that it has a large open-world environment. The third statement expands on this by noting that the game also has elements of sandbox and open-world games. None of these statements contradict each other, but rather provide different aspects of the game's overall genre and gameplay."
