Both statements acknowledge that while Eve is primarily a hip hop and R&B artist, her music has also incorporated elements of other genres such as pop and soul. Statement 1 specifically mentions dance as another genre that has influenced her music, while Statement 2 emphasizes the incorporation of soul and pop.
