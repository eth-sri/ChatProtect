  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of Ancestor are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Scott Sigler is the author of the novel Ancestor. The only difference is the use of the word \"novel\" in the first statement, which is not present in the second statement. However, this does not change the meaning of the statement. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
