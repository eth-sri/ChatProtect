Both statements provide additional information about the director of The Sugarland Express, Steven Spielberg, and his first theatrical feature film. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 first identifies Spielberg as the director and then mentions that The Sugarland Express was his first theatrical feature film. Statement 2 first mentions that The Sugarland Express was Spielberg's first theatrical feature film and then identifies him as the director."
