  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of A Woman of the Iron People? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author is Eleanor Arnason, while statement 2 claims that the author is Elizabeth Bear. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
