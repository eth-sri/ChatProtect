  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Godzilla are not contradictory. Both statements describe Kaiju as a Japanese genre that features giant monsters attacking cities and engaging in epic battles. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions that Kaiju films often involve battles with other creatures or human forces, while statement 2 does not. However, this difference does not contradict the overall description of Kaiju as a genre."
