  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Double? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides another notable producer in the film industry, James Cameron, without making any claims about his involvement in The Double. Statement 2 expands on James Cameron's notable works, but again does not make any claims about his involvement in The Double. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the original text that identifies scoringmax as the producer of The Double."
