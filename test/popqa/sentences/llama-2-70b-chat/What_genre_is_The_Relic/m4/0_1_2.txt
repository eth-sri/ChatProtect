  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Relic are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Statement 1 acknowledges that the novel contains elements of multiple genres, including science fiction, horror, and thriller. Statement 2, on the other hand, emphasizes the thriller aspect of the novel. Therefore, both statements provide different perspectives on the genre of The Relic, but they do not contradict each other."
