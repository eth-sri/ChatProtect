  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Emperor An of Jin are contradictory because they provide different names for his mother. One statement claims that Empress Dowager Wenming was his mother, while the other statement claims that Empress Xu was his mother. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
