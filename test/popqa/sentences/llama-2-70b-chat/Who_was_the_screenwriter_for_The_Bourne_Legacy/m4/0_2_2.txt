Statement 1 provides additional information about Tony Gilroy's involvement in the Bourne franchise, specifically his work on the screenplays for the first three films. Statement 2 essentially repeats this information in a slightly different way. Both statements are consistent in identifying Tony Gilroy as the screenwriter for The Bourne Legacy."
