  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Bourne Legacy are not contradictory. They both provide the same information and identify Tony Gilroy as the screenwriter for the movie. The only difference between the two statements is the use of parentheses in the first one, which is a stylistic choice and does not affect the meaning of the sentence."
