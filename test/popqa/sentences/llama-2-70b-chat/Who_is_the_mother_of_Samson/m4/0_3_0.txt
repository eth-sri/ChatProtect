  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the mother of Samson was visited by an angel of the Lord who announced that she would give birth to a son. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that the son would be a Nazirite, while statement 2 simply mentions that she would conceive and give birth to a son. Both statements support the idea that the mother of Samson was a woman who was previously unable to conceive children."
