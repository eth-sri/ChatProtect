  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the circumstances surrounding Samson's birth and the role of the angel of the Lord in his conception. Statement 1 explains that the mother was visited by an angel who announced her pregnancy and the special status of her son as a Nazirite. Statement 2 adds that the mother was miraculously granted the ability to conceive and give birth through a divine encounter with the angel. Both statements are consistent with the biblical account of Samson's birth and do not contradict each other."
