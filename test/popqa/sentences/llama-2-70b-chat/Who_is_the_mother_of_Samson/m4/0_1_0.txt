  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about how Samson's mother is referred to in the biblical text, without explicitly naming her. The first statement highlights that she is referred to as \"his father's wife\" or \"his mother,\" while the second statement emphasizes that she is referred to as \"Samson's mother\" or \"the woman.\" Together, these statements provide a more complete understanding of how Samson's mother is identified in the biblical text."
