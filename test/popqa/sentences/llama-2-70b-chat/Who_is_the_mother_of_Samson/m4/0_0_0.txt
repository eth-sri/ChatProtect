Both statements say that the mother of Samson is not explicitly named in the biblical account of Samson's life, but they cannot both be true. If the first statement is true, then the second statement is unnecessary and redundant. If the second statement is true, then the first statement is false. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true and are contradictory."
