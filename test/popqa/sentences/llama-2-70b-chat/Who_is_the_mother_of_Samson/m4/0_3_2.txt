  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Samson's mother was visited by an angel of the Lord who announced that she would give birth to a son who would be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth. The only difference is in the wording used to describe Samson's mother, but both statements agree that she was the one visited by the angel."
