  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the circumstances surrounding Samson's birth, but they do not contradict the fact that his mother is not explicitly named in the biblical account. The first statement highlights the fact that Samson's mother was previously barren, while the second statement emphasizes the miraculous nature of his conception. Both statements are consistent with the biblical account and do not contradict each other."
