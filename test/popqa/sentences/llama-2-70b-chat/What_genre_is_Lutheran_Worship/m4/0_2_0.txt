  "explanation": "The statements about what genre is Lutheran Worship are not contradictory. Both statements describe the typical elements of Lutheran worship, with statement 1 providing a broader overview and including the mention of a sermon, while statement 2 focuses more specifically on the traditional elements of hymns, prayers, and scripture readings. Both statements are consistent with the characterization of Lutheran worship as a liturgical style based on the teachings of Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition."
