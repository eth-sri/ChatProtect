  "prefix": " Lutheran worship is a form of Christian worship that is typical of Lutheran churches. It is characterized by a liturgical style that is based on the teachings of Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition. Lutheran worship typically includes a variety of elements, such as hymns, prayers, scripture readings, and a sermon. The liturgy is often structured around the liturgical season, with different variations for different Sundays and holy days throughout the year. In terms of music, Lutheran worship has traditionally featured a strong emphasis on choral music, with choirs and congregational singing playing a prominent role in many Lutheran churches. Hymns and chorales are often accompanied by organ or piano, and may also include other instruments such as trumpets, trombones, and handbells. In terms of genre, Lutheran worship music is often classified as sacred music or religious music, and is generally considered to be a subgenre of classical music.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Lutheran worship are not contradictory. While the text describes Lutheran worship as a form of sacred or religious music within the classical music genre, the two additional statements explain that Lutheran worship has also been influenced by other musical styles and traditions, including folk and Baroque music. These statements do not contradict the classification of Lutheran worship as a subgenre of classical music, but rather provide additional context and influences on the genre."
