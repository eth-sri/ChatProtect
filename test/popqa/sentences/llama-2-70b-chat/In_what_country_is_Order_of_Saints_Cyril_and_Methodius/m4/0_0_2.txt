While the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius is named after two Byzantine brothers who spread Christianity in the Slavic world, who were from what is now modern-day Greece, the order itself is associated with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Additionally, the order has spread throughout Eastern Europe, indicating that it has a presence beyond just one country. Therefore, both statements can be true without contradicting each other."
