Although the first statement mentions that the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius is a Bulgarian Orthodox Church order, it also acknowledges that the order is named after the two Byzantine brothers who spread Christianity in the Slavic world. The second statement simply reiterates this fact. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
