  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Working are contradictory. The first statement describes Working as a drama series created by Justin Spitzer and starring Adam Scott, while the second statement describes it as a series created by Mindy Kaling and starring her in the lead role. These descriptions suggest that the two statements are referring to different shows, and therefore, the genre of Working cannot be determined from these statements."
