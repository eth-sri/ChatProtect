  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Skin? are contradictory. The first statement mentions the director and writer of the 2008 film Skin, but does not mention the producer. The second statement mentions a television series called Skin, but does not specify if it is related to the 2008 film or if it is a separate production. Therefore, there is no clear answer to the question of who was the producer of Skin based on these two statements."
