  "explanation": "The statements are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Robert Harris as the author of Romanitas and provides additional information about the book's publication date and series. The second statement, however, is incorrect as it describes a different book by Harris, also set in ancient Rome but with a different protagonist and title."
