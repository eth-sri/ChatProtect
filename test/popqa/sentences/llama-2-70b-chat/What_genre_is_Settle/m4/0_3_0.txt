  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of \"Settle\" are contradictory. Statement 1 describes the song as a combination of EDM and contemporary R&B, while Statement 2 classifies it as deep house. While deep house is a subgenre of EDM, it is not typically associated with contemporary R&B. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
