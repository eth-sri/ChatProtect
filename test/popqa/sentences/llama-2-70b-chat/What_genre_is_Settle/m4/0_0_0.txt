  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Settle\" are contradictory. Statement 1 identifies \"Settle\" as a song by the British electronic music group Disclosure, while Statement 2 identifies Settle as an electronic dance music duo. While both statements mention electronic music, they refer to different things - Statement 1 refers to a specific song, while Statement 2 refers to a musical group. Therefore, the statements cannot be reconciled and are contradictory."
