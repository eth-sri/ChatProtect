  "explanation": "The statements about John Entwistle's genre are not contradictory. While the text mentions his contributions to rock, pop, and R&B, statement 1 adds that he was also influenced by jazz bassists. This does not contradict the previous statement, as jazz is a genre that can overlap with rock, pop, and R&B. Statement 2 further supports the idea that Entwistle's influence extended beyond one specific genre, as he influenced bassists in both the punk and heavy metal genres."
