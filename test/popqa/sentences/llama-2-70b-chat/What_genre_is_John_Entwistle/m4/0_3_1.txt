  "explanation": "The statements about John Entwistle's genre are not contradictory. While the text mentions his contributions to rock, pop, and R&B, statement 1 adds that he was also influenced by jazz bassists. This does not contradict the previous statement, as jazz can also be considered a genre that influenced Entwistle's playing style. Statement 2 also does not contradict the previous statements, as it simply adds that he had a successful solo career in addition to his work with The Who."
