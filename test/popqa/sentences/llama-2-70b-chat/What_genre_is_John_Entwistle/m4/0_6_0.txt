  "prefix": " John Entwistle was a British musician and songwriter, best known as the bassist for the rock band The Who. He was known for his powerful and inventive bass playing, and his contributions to the band's music spanned a wide range of genres, including rock, pop, and R&B. Entwistle's playing style was heavily influenced by the bassists of the 1950s and 1960s, including James Jamerson, the bassist for Motown's in-house band, the Funk Brothers. He was also influenced by jazz bassists such as Charles Mingus and John Paul Jones. Entwistle's bass lines often served as a counterpoint to Pete Townshend's guitar playing, and he was known for his ability to create complex, melodic bass lines that helped to drive the band's songs. He was also a skilled singer, and sang lead vocals on several of The Who's songs, including \"My Wife\" and \"Boris the Spider.\"",
