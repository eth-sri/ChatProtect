  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the father of Sisowath of Cambodia? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the father of Sisowath of Cambodia is King Ang Duong, while Statement 2 claims that the father of Sisowath of Cambodia is King Sisowath I. These are two different individuals, and therefore cannot both be the father of Sisowath. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
