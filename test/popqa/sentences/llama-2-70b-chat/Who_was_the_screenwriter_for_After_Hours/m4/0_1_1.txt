Statement 1 provides additional information about Joseph Minion's career as a screenwriter and mentions another film he wrote that was directed by Martin Scorsese. Statement 2 simply adds another film to the list of screenplays written by Minion. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Joseph Minion was the screenwriter for After Hours."
