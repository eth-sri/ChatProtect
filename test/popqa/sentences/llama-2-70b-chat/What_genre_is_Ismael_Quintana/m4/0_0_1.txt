The first statement suggests that he has released music in a variety of genres, including pop, rock, and electronic, while the second statement specifically mentions that he has blended flamenco and pop music. While it is possible that Ismael Quintana has released music in multiple genres, the two statements do not align in terms of the specific genres he has worked in."
