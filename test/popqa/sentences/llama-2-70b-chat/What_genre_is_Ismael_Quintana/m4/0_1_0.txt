  "explanation": "The statements about Ismael Quintana's genre are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that he has released music in a variety of genres and often blends elements from multiple styles, making it difficult to categorize him into a single genre. The second statement simply notes that he is often associated with the indie and alternative music scenes, which does not necessarily contradict the first statement. It is possible for an artist to be associated with a particular scene or subculture while still incorporating elements from various genres into their music."
