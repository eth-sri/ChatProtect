  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Good News are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Betty Comden and Adolph Green were the screenwriters for the movie. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that they also provided the lyrics for the film's songs, while statement 2 emphasizes that they were a husband-and-wife screenwriting team. Both statements provide additional information about the screenwriters but do not contradict each other."
