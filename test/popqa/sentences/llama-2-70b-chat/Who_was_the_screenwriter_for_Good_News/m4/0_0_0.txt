  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Good News? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that the screenwriters for \"Good News\" were Betty Comden and Adolph Green, while Statement 2 only mentions Betty Comden as the screenwriter. This means that Statement 1 includes Adolph Green as a co-screenwriter, while Statement 2 does not. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
