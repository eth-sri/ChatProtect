While statement 1 provides additional information about the source material and director of the movie, it does not contradict the initial statement that Betty Comden and Adolph Green were the screenwriters for \"Good News\". Statement 2 simply reiterates that the movie was directed by Charles Walters, which is also mentioned in statement 1."
