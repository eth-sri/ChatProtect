  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Horus? are not contradictory. Both statements refer to the myth of Osiris and Horus, and how it represents the cycle of life and death. Statement 1 emphasizes the struggle between good and evil, while Statement 2 adds the concept of rebirth to the cycle. However, both statements are consistent with the idea that the myth of Osiris and Horus was seen as a symbolic representation of the cycle of life and death in Egyptian mythology."
