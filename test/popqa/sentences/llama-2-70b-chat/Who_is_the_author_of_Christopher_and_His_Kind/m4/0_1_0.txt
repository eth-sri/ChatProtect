  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Christopher and His Kind? are contradictory. The first statement correctly states that the book was written by Christopher Isherwood and published in 1936, while the second statement incorrectly states that the book was first published in 1931. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
