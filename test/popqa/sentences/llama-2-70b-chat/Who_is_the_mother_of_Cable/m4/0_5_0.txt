  "prefix": " The mother of Cable, a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe, is not explicitly stated in the comics or other official sources. However, based on the character's backstory and various hints throughout the comics, it is heavily implied that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix. Cable's father, Scott Summers (Cyclops), had a romantic relationship with Jean Grey, and it is suggested that Cable was conceived during this time. However, Jean's death and subsequent resurrection as the Phoenix complicated the timeline, and it is not clear whether Cable was born before or after her death. Furthermore, Cable's powers and abilities are linked to the Phoenix Force, which is a powerful energy that has been passed down through Jean's family line.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Cable? are not contradictory. Both statements support the theory that Jean Grey is Cable's mother based on the genetic link between Cable and the Phoenix Force, which is associated with Jean's family line. Statement 1 emphasizes the strength of this genetic link, while Statement 2 suggests that Jean may have played a role in Cable's conception and powers. Together, these statements provide additional evidence for the theory that Jean Grey is Cable's mother."
