  "prefix": " The mother of Cable, a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe, is not explicitly stated in the comics or other official sources. However, based on the character's backstory and various hints throughout the comics, it is heavily implied that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix. Cable's father, Scott Summers (Cyclops), had a romantic relationship with Jean Grey, and it is suggested that Cable was conceived during this time. However, Jean's death and subsequent resurrection as the Phoenix complicated the timeline, and it is not clear whether Cable was born before or after her death. Furthermore, Cable's powers and abilities are linked to the Phoenix Force, which is a powerful energy that has been passed down through Jean's family line. This connection suggests a strong genetic link between Cable and Jean, supporting the theory that she is his mother.",

  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Cable are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that there is no definitive confirmation from Marvel Comics, but suggests that the hints and clues heavily imply that Jean Grey is Cable's mother. Statement 2 simply states that Jean Grey is indeed Cable's mother, which is a conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence presented in the text. Both statements support the theory that Jean Grey is Cable's mother."
