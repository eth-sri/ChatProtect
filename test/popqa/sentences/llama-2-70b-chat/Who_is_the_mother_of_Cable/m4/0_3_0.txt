However, based on the character's backstory and various hints throughout the comics, it is heavily implied that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix. Cable's father, Scott Summers (Cyclops), had a romantic relationship with Jean Grey, and it is suggested that Cable was conceived during this time.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Cable's mother are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the timeline is complicated due to Jean Grey's death and resurrection, making it unclear whether Cable was born before or after her death. Statement 2 provides additional information about Cable's birth, stating that he was born in the future in the year 2087. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Jean Grey is heavily implied to be Cable's mother based on the character's backstory and hints throughout the comics."
