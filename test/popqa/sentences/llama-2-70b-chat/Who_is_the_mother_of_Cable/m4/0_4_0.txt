  "prefix": " The mother of Cable, a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe, is not explicitly stated in the comics or other official sources. However, based on the character's backstory and various hints throughout the comics, it is heavily implied that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix. Cable's father, Scott Summers (Cyclops), had a romantic relationship with Jean Grey, and it is suggested that Cable was conceived during this time. However, Jean's death and subsequent resurrection as the Phoenix complicated the timeline, and it is not clear whether Cable was born before or after her death.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements support the idea that Cable's powers and abilities are linked to the Phoenix Force, which is associated with Jean Grey. Statement 1 suggests that the Phoenix Force has been passed down through Jean's family line, which could explain Cable's connection to it. Statement 2 directly states that Cable's powers are linked to his mother's Phoenix energy, which aligns with the theory that Jean Grey is his mother."
