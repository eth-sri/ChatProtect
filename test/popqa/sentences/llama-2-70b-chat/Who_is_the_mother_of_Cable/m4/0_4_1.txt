However, based on the character's backstory and various hints throughout the comics, it is heavily implied that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix. Cable's father, Scott Summers (Cyclops), had a romantic relationship with Jean Grey, and it is suggested that Cable was conceived during this time. However, Jean's death and subsequent resurrection as the Phoenix complicated the timeline, and it is not clear whether Cable was born before or after her death.",
