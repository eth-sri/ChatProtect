Both statements suggest that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix, and that she had a romantic relationship with Scott Summers (Cyclops), which resulted in Cable's conception. The only difference is that statement 2 explicitly states that Cable was conceived through a relationship between Jean Grey and Scott Summers, while statement 1 suggests that Cable was conceived during their romantic relationship."
