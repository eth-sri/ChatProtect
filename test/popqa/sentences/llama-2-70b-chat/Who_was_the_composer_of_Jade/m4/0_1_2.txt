Statement 1 explains that the music for the game was created by a team of composers and sound designers, while Statement 2 specifies that the audio team at Ubisoft Montreal designed the game's score and sound effects. Both statements are consistent in stating that the music for Jade was not the work of a single composer, but rather a collaborative effort."
