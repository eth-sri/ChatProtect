  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Firm are not contradictory. Both statements identify the novel as belonging to the legal genre, with statement 1 specifying it as legal fiction and statement 2 as legal thriller. While there may be some overlap between the two sub-genres, they are not mutually exclusive and can coexist within the same work. Therefore, the statements complement each other in providing a more detailed understanding of the genre of The Firm."
