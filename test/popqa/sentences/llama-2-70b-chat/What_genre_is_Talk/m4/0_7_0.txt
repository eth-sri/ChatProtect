It is characterized by its use of spoken word vocals, often delivered in a rhythmic or rhyming style, over a musical background that can range from simple to complex. Talk music can incorporate elements of various other genres, such as punk, new wave, and electronic music. Some notable examples of talk music include:\n\n* The Talking Heads, a new wave band known for their quirky, rhythmic talk-singing style. * Lou Reed, a pioneer of talk music, known for his deadpan, spoken-word delivery in songs like \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" * Laurie Anderson, a performance artist and musician known for her distinctive spoken-word style and use of electronic music elements. * William S. Burroughs, a writer and musician who experimented with spoken-word music in the 1960s and 1970s.",
