  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Liability? are contradictory. The first statement suggests that the screenwriter is not explicitly stated, while the second statement explicitly states that the film was written and directed by Craig Viveiros. Additionally, the second statement provides conflicting information about the year of the film's release, which may further confuse the reader."
