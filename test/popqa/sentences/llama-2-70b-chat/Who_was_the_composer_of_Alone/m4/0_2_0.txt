  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Alone? are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that David Guetta co-wrote the song \"Alone\" with Ne-Yo and Giorgio Tuinfort, and also mentions that he is a DJ and record producer. The second statement provides additional information about David Guetta's career as a producer, stating that he has produced several other successful songs, including \"Titanium\" and \"SexyBack\". Both statements are consistent with David Guetta being the composer of \"Alone\" and a successful producer of other songs."
