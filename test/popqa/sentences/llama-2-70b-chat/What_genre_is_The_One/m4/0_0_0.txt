  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is The One? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that The One is a romantic comedy film, while Statement 2 suggests that The One is a song. These two genres are completely different and cannot be applied to the same work. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
