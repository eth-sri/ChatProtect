  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Searching? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge the significant contributions of Alan Turing to the field of search engines and information retrieval. The first statement specifically mentions Turing's work on the Turing Test as laying the foundation for modern search engines, while the second statement emphasizes the importance of Turing's proposal of the Turing Test in measuring a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. Both statements support the idea that Turing can be considered one of the fathers of searching."
