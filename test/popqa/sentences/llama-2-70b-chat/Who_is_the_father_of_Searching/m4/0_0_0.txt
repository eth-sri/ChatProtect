  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Searching? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that there are multiple individuals who could be considered the father of searching, while Statement 2 specifically identifies Alan Turing as the sole father of searching. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
