  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Searching? are not contradictory. The text mentions that several individuals have been referred to as the \"father of searching,\" and statement 1 adds Vannevar Bush to the list of potential candidates. Statement 2 provides additional information about Bush's contributions to the field of information retrieval, specifically his invention of the term \"memex,\" which is considered a precursor to modern search engines. Both statements provide complementary information about the history of search engines and the individuals who have played a significant role in their development."
