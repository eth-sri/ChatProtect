  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Searching? are not contradictory. The text mentions that there have been several individuals referred to as the \"father of searching,\" and statement 1 adds Vannevar Bush to that list. Statement 2 provides additional information about Bush's contributions to the field of information retrieval and his nickname as the \"father of searching.\" Both statements are consistent with the idea that there have been multiple individuals who have made significant contributions to the development of search engines and information retrieval."
