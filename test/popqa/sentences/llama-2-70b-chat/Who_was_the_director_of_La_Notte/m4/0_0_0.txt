  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of La Notte? are not contradictory. They both provide the same answer to the prompt, with only minor differences in wording. Statement 1 includes the year of the film's release, while Statement 2 does not. However, both statements clearly identify Michelangelo Antonioni as the director of La Notte."
