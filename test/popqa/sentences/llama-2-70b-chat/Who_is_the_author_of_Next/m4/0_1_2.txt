  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Next is not a known work of literature and therefore there is no author to be determined. Statement 1 provides additional information about the word \"Next\" and its potential meanings, while statement 2 suggests that the question itself is not valid or meaningful. However, both statements ultimately reach the same conclusion that there is no author of Next."
