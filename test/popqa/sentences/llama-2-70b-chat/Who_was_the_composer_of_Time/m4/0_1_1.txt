  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Time\" are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Freddie Mercury wrote both the music and lyrics to the song, and it was released in 1975 on the album \"A Night at the Opera.\" However, statement 2 claims that the music and lyrics were released in 1977 on the same album. The discrepancy in the release date of the album creates a contradiction in the statements."
