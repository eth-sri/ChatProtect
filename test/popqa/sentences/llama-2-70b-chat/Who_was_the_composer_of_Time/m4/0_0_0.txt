  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Time\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify Freddie Mercury as the composer of the song. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that Freddie Mercury composed the song as a member of the band Queen, while statement 2 simply identifies Freddie Mercury as the composer without mentioning the band. Therefore, both statements are true and consistent with each other."
