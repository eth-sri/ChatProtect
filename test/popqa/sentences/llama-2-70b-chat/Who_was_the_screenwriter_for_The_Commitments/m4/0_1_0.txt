  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Commitments are not contradictory. While the first statement mentions that Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were the screenwriters and executive producers of the movie, the second statement adds that they were also the creators of the film's story. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the roles played by Clement and La Frenais in the making of The Commitments."
