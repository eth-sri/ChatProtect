  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Burning Man are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the event is directed by a team of individuals, while Statement 2 provides more specific information about the composition of that team, including volunteers, staff, a CEO, and a board of directors. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Burning Man is not directed by a single individual, but rather by a group of people working together."
