  "explanation": "The statements about Modern Talking's genre are not contradictory. While both statements highlight the duo's commercial success, they do not contradict the fact that Modern Talking's music can be classified as Euro disco, pop, and synth-pop. The genre classification and the commercial success are two separate aspects of the duo's career."
