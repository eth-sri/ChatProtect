  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies the hit songs of Modern Talking, but statement 2 lists songs that are not by Modern Talking. \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" is a song by Eurythmics, \"The Sound of Loving\" is a song by Bad Boys Blue, and \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" is a song by Modern Talking, but it is already mentioned in statement 1. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect and contradicts statement 1."
