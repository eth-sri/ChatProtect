  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. Both statements describe the duo's music as catchy and upbeat, with romantic lyrics or ballads. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions a synth-heavy sound, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the overall description of their music as pop. Therefore, both statements are consistent with Modern Talking being a pop music genre."
