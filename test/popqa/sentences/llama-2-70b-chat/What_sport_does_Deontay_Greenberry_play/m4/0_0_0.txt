  "explanation": "The statements about \"What sport does Deontay Greenberry play?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the author is unable to determine what sport Deontay Greenberry plays, while Statement 2 asserts that he plays football. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
