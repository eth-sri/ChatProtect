  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge the lack of information about Deontay Greenberry and the possibility that they may play a sport that is not known to the writer. The first statement suggests that it's also possible that Deontay Greenberry may not play a sport at all. The second statement acknowledges that there are multiple sports that Deontay Greenberry could potentially play, but without more information, it's impossible to determine which one. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
