Statement 1 explains that James was a strong supporter of the Protestant faith, which is consistent with his membership in the Church of England, as the Church of England is a Protestant church. Statement 2 provides additional information about the Church of England, stating that it was the state church of England and the mother church of the Anglican Communion. Both statements provide complementary information about James VI and I's religion and the Church of England."
