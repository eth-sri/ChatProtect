  "explanation": "The statements about James VI and I's religion are not contradictory, but they do differ in the terminology used to describe the same event. Both statements refer to James granting religious freedom to Catholics in England in 1603, with one calling it the \"Edict of James\" and the other calling it the \"Declaration of Indulgence.\" These terms are interchangeable and both refer to the same act of religious tolerance. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
