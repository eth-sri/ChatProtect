  "explanation": "The statements about the author of The Word are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the text itself does not explicitly identify the author, but that the attribution to John has been widely accepted. Statement 2 simply reiterates that the attribution to John has been widely accepted. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional context about the authorship of The Word."
