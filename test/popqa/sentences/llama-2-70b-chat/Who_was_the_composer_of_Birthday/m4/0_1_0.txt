  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Birthday\" are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the original title of the song was \"Good Morning to All\" and that it was composed by Patty Hill in the late 19th century. The only difference is that statement 2 repeats the information from the beginning of the text, while statement 1 adds the detail that the song was intended for students to sing before starting their lessons."
