  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Omega Glory? are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter. Statement 1 claims that Morgan Woodward was the screenwriter, while statement 2 claims that Meyer Dolinsky was the screenwriter. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
