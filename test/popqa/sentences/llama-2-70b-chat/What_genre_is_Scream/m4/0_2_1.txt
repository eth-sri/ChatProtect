  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Scream are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Scream is a horror movie and a slasher film, but they also highlight the unique elements that set it apart from other films in the same subgenre. Statement 1 emphasizes the self-awareness and satire present in the film, while Statement 2 specifically mentions how Scream deconstructs horror tropes and cliches. These statements complement each other and provide a more nuanced understanding of the genre of Scream."
