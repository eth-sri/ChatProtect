  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Scream are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Scream is a horror movie and a slasher film, but they also highlight the unique elements that set it apart from traditional slasher films. Statement 1 emphasizes the satirical and self-aware aspects of the movie, while Statement 2 focuses on how Scream intentionally subverts and mocks common horror movie tropes. These statements complement each other and provide a more nuanced understanding of the genre of Scream."
