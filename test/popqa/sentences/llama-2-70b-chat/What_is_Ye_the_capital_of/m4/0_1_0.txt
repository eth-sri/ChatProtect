  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Ye the capital of?\" are contradictory. The first statement states that Ye is not the capital of any country, while the second statement claims that Ye is a city located in the Shan State of Myanmar. The two statements are referring to different things - the first statement is discussing Ye as a capital city, while the second statement is simply identifying Ye as a city within a specific region. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
