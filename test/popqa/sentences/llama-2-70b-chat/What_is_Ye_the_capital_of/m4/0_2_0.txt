  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Ye the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that \"Ye\" is not commonly used in modern language and is an archaic spelling of \"The.\" While the first statement uses the word \"sometimes,\" the second statement emphasizes that it is not commonly used. However, both statements support the idea that \"Ye\" is not a relevant term when discussing the capital of any country."
