  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Gente di Roma are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Cesare Zavattini, the screenwriter for the film, and his involvement in the Italian neorealist movement. Statement 1 specifically mentions Zavattini's work on other neorealist films and his collaboration with director Luigi Zampa on Gente di Roma, while statement 2 highlights Zavattini's overall prominence in the neorealist movement. Both statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Zavattini's career and contributions to Italian cinema."
