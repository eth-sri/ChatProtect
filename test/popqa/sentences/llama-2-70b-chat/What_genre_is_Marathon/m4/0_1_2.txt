  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Marathon are not contradictory. While Statement 1 provides information about the initial release of the game on the Macintosh platform, Statement 2 simply adds that the game was later ported to other platforms, including Windows and Mac OS. Both statements confirm that Marathon is a first-person shooter game, and there is no contradiction between them."
