  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the ruling family, the House of Hesse-Kassel, followed the Lutheran faith. However, statement 1 provides additional information that the majority of the population in the landgraviate also followed Lutheranism, while statement 2 only mentions that the ruling family was Protestant, which is a broader term that includes various denominations such as Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism. Therefore, statement 1 is more specific and accurate in describing the religion of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel."
