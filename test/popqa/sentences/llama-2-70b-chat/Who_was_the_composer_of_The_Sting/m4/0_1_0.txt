Statement 1 provides a comprehensive list of the three Academy Awards that Marvin Hamlisch won for his work on the film, including Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Adaptation Score. Statement 2 specifically highlights the award that Hamlisch won for his original dramatic score for The Sting. Both statements support the fact that Marvin Hamlisch was the composer of The Sting."
