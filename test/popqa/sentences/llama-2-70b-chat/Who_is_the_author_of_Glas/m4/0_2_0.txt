  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Glas are not contradictory. Both statements identify Jacques Derrida as the author of the novel Glas and describe him as a French philosopher and literary theorist known for his work on post-structuralism and deconstruction. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes the importance of Glas in Derrida's body of work, while statement 2 provides a broader description of his intellectual interests."
