  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Glas? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Jacques Derrida is the author of Glas, while statement 2 claims that Jean Genet is the author. Since they are two different authors, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
