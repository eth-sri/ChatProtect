  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Glas? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the publication history of the novel, including the fact that it was translated into English in 1986. Statement 2 simply confirms that the novel was first published in 1974. Both statements support the fact that Jacques Derrida is the author of Glas."
