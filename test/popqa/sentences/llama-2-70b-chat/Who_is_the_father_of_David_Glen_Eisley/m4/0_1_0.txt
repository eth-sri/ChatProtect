  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements explain that providing information about the father of David Glen Eisley would be inappropriate due to the sensitive and private nature of personal family relationships. The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the phrase \"without his consent\" in the first statement, which emphasizes the importance of obtaining consent before sharing personal information."
