  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Episodes? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly states that Hat Trick Productions was the producer of the show \"Episodes\" and also mentions that it was produced in association with Crane Klarik Productions. \n\nHowever, statement 2 is incorrect as it names Jeffrey K.larner as the producer, which is not true. While Jeffrey Klarik was one of the creators and writers of the show, he was not the sole producer."
