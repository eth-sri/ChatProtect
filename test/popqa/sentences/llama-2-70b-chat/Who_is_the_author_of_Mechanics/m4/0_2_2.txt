  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Sir Isaac Newton as the author of the book \"Mechanics\" and provides additional information about the book's publication and significance. The second statement expands on the impact of Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation, which were presented in the book, on the development of modern physics and engineering. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Sir Isaac Newton is the author of \"Mechanics.\""
