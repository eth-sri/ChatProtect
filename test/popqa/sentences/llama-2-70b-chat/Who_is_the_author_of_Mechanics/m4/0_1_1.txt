  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Mechanics? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the book \"Mechanics\" and its publication history, but they do not contradict the initial statement that Sir Isaac Newton is the author of the book. Statement 1 emphasizes the book's significance in the history of science, while Statement 2 simply repeats the book's full title and publication year."
