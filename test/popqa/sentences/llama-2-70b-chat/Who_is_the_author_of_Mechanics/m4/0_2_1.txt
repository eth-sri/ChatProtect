  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Mechanics? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Sir Isaac Newton's book \"Mechanics\" and its significance in the history of science. Statement 1 specifically highlights the content of the book, while Statement 2 emphasizes the impact of Newton's laws on modern physics. Both statements complement each other and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the author and his work."
