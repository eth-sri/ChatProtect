Both statements mention that the stadium hosts rugby league and rugby union matches, but statement 1 adds that it also hosts other sports events such as soccer games, while also hosting concerts and other entertainment events. Therefore, statement 1 provides additional information about the variety of events that take place at Carlaw Park, but does not contradict the information provided in statement 2."
