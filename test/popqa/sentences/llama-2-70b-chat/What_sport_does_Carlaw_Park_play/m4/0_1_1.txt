  "explanation": "The statements about what sport Carlaw Park plays are not contradictory. Statement 1 confirms that Carlaw Park is primarily used for rugby league matches, and specifically mentions that the New Zealand Warriors, a professional rugby league team, play their home games there. Statement 2 provides additional information by specifying that another rugby league team, the Auckland Vulcans, also competes at Carlaw Park. Both statements support the idea that rugby league is the primary sport played at Carlaw Park."
