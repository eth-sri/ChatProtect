  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement specifies that Carlaw Park is primarily used for rugby league and rugby union matches, it also mentions that the stadium hosts other sports events such as soccer games. The second statement simply reiterates that the stadium also hosts concerts and other entertainment events, which is not related to the primary sport played at the stadium. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the events hosted at Carlaw Park without contradicting each other."
