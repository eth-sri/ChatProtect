  "explanation": "The statements about what sport Carlaw Park plays are not contradictory. Both statements mention rugby league, with statement 1 specifically mentioning the New Zealand Warriors and statement 2 mentioning the Auckland Rugby League team. Additionally, the text itself mentions that Carlaw Park is primarily used for rugby league and rugby union matches. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the overall theme of the text."
