While the first statement mentions that Ice Cube was the producer of the movie, the second statement adds that he was also one of the writers and stars of the film, playing the lead character Craig Jones. These statements provide additional information about Ice Cube's involvement in the making of the movie, but they do not contradict the fact that he was the producer."
