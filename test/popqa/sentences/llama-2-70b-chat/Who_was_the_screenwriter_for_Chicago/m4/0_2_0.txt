  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the stage musical that the screenplay was adapted from, including the writers of the music and lyrics (John Kander and Fred Ebb) and the book writers (Ebb and Bob Fosse). Statement 2 simply confirms that Kander and Ebb were the writers of the musical. Both statements are consistent with the original prompt about the screenwriter for the film adaptation."
