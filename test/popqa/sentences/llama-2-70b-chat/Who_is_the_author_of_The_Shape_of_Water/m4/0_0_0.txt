  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Shape of Water? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that both Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor are the authors of The Shape of Water, while Statement 2 only mentions Guillermo del Toro as the author. Therefore, Statement 1 includes an additional author, making it contradictory to Statement 2."
