  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Cao Wei's religion is not explicitly mentioned in the novel or historical records, while the second statement provides additional context about the religious landscape of ancient China during the time period of the Three Kingdoms. It is possible that Cao Wei's beliefs and practices were influenced by a mix of traditional Chinese folk religions, Taoism, and Buddhism, as was common during that time, but there is no definitive answer. The second statement simply highlights that there was no single dominant religion in China during that time period."
