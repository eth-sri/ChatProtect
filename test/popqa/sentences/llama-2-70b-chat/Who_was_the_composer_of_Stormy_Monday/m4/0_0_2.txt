  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Stormy Monday\" are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the song was composed by Aaron \"T-Bone\" Walker. The only difference is in the wording and structure of the sentences. Statement 1 provides a more detailed description of the song as a \"song that was written and composed,\" while Statement 2 is a more concise statement that directly identifies T-Bone Walker as the composer."
