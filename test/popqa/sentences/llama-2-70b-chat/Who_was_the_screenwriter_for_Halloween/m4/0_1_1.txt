  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Halloween are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that John Carpenter was involved in the making of the film as the screenwriter and director. The first statement adds that Debra Hill also co-wrote the screenplay, while the second statement emphasizes Carpenter's role as the director. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Carpenter's involvement in the film."
