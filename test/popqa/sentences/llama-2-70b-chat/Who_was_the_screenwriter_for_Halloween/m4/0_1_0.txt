Statement 1 provides additional information about Carpenter's involvement in the film as both director and composer, while also confirming Hill's co-writing credit. Statement 2 adds another co-writer to the mix, Moustapha Akkad, but does not contradict the fact that Carpenter and Hill were also involved in writing the screenplay."
