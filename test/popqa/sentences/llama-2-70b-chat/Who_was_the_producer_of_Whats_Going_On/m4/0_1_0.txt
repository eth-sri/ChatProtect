  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of What's Going On? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that Marvin Gaye produced the album in collaboration with Berry Gordy Jr. from Motown Records, while Statement 2 suggests that he produced the album with Tamla Records. However, Tamla Records was actually a subsidiary of Motown Records, so it is possible that both statements are partially true. Nonetheless, the statements are not entirely consistent with each other."
