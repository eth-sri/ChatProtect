  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Pianoplayers? are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Anthony Burgess as the author of the novel and provides additional information about its content. However, the second statement contradicts the first by stating that the novel was first published in 1987 instead of 1986. This inconsistency creates confusion and undermines the credibility of the information provided."
