The film starred Michael Jackson and starred many of his music videos, including \"Thriller\" and \"Smooth Criminal.\" King's involvement in Ghosts came about because of his friendship with Jackson.

When Jackson approached King about writing a screenplay for a short film that he wanted to make, King agreed, despite not having any previous experience writing screenplays.",
