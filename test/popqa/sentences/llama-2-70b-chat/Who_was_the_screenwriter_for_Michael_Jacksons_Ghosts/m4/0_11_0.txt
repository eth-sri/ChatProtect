  "prefix": " The screenwriter for Michael Jackson's Ghosts was Stephen King. Yes, that Stephen King, the famous author known for his horror and suspense novels. King wrote the screenplay for Ghosts, which was a 40-minute short film that was directed by Stan Winston and released in 1996. The film starred Michael Jackson and starred many of his music videos, including \"Thriller\" and \"Smooth Criminal.\" King's involvement in Ghosts came about because of his friendship with Jackson. The two had met in the early 1980s, and King had been a longtime fan of Jackson's music. When Jackson approached King about writing a screenplay for a short film that he wanted to make, King agreed, despite not having any previous experience writing screenplays. Ghosts tells the story of a group of ghosts who haunt an old mansion that is being renovated by a family. The ghosts are led by a mysterious figure known as the \"Maestro,\" who is played by Jackson. The film features a number of musical numbers, including the title track, which was written by Jackson and Teddy Riley. Ghosts was not well received by critics, but it has become a cult classic among fans of Jackson and King.",
