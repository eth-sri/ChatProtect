  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Michael Jackson's Ghosts are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Stephen King was the screenwriter for the short film Ghosts, which was directed by Stan Winston and released in 1996. The only difference between the two statements is the length of the film, with one stating it was 40 minutes and the other stating it was 35 minutes. However, this does not contradict the fact that Stephen King was the screenwriter for the film."
