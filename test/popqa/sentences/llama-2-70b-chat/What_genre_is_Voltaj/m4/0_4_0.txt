  "explanation": "The statements about Voltaj's genre are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that it's difficult to define their music with a single genre, but lists some of the genres that their music has been associated with. The second statement adds to this by specifying that their music has been associated with the Romanian alternative rock scene. Both statements provide different perspectives on Voltaj's genre, but they do not contradict each other."
