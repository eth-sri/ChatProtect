  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Voltaj? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Voltaj's music as a blend of rock, pop, and folk elements, while Statement 2 describes it as a blend of hard rock and heavy metal elements with traditional Romanian folk music. These two descriptions suggest different genres, with Statement 1 leaning more towards pop rock and Statement 2 leaning more towards folk metal. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
