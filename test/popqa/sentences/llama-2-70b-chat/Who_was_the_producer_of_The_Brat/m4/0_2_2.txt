  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Brat are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that The Brat starred Charlie Chaplin and Edna Purviance, while Statement 2 claims that a number of films, including The Brat, starred actress Dolores Costello. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present different information about the cast of The Brat. However, both statements agree that John Francis Dillon was the producer of the film."
