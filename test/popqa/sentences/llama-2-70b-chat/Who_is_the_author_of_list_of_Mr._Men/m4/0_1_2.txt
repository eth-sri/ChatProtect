  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. The first statement clearly states that Roger Hargreaves both wrote and illustrated all of the Mr. Men books himself. However, the second statement contradicts this by stating that the books were illustrated by Adam Hargreaves, Roger's son. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
