  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Tropic Moon are contradictory. Statement 1 is incorrect as Dictionary is not an author but rather a reference book. Statement 2 is correct as Henry Miller is the actual author of Tropic Moon. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
