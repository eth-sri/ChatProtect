  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What sport does 1994-95 Belgian First Division play?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies that the 1994-95 Belgian First Division was a season of the top division of football in Belgium, while Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that it doesn't play football. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
