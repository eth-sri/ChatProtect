  "explanation": "The statements about Chiaki Konaka, the screenwriter for Paprika, are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his unique storytelling style that often delves into psychological and philosophical themes such as identity, consciousness, and the blurring of reality and fantasy. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions the blurring of reality and fantasy, while statement 1 uses the more general term \"human condition.\" However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea about Konaka's writing style and thematic interests."
