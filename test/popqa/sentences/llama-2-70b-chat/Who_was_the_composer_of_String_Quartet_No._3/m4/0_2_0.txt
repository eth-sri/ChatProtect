Statement 1 suggests that the composer was likely Johannes Brahms based on the information provided, while Statement 2 states that the piece was actually composed by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide conflicting information about the identity of the composer."
