  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Overseas? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 identifies Overseas as a jazz album, while Statement 2 identifies it as a rock band. These two genres are distinct and different from each other, with jazz being characterized by improvisation, swing rhythms, and complex harmonies, while rock is characterized by amplified instruments, a strong beat, and often distorted guitar sounds. Therefore, it is not possible for Overseas to be both a jazz album and a rock band at the same time."
