  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mass? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. One statement claims that Leonard Bernstein was the composer of Mass, while the other claims that Johann Sebastian Bach was the composer. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
