  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mass? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about Mass, specifying that it is a theatre piece composed by Bernstein in 1971. Statement 2 simply clarifies that Mass is a musical composition, which is consistent with the fact that Bernstein was the composer of it. Therefore, both statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
