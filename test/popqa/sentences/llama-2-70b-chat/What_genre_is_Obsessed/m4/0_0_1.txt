  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"Obsessed\" are not contradictory, but rather the second statement is a subset of the first statement. The first statement specifies that \"Obsessed\" falls under the genres of R&B and pop music, while the second statement narrows it down to just pop music. Therefore, the second statement does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides a more specific classification within the broader genre of pop music."
