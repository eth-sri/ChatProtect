  "explanation": "The statements about Eckart von Hirschhausen's occupation are not contradictory, but they are unrelated. The first statement correctly identifies him as a physician, comedian, and TV host, while the second statement suggests that he is also a fencer. However, being a fencer is not his primary occupation or profession, and it does not contradict the fact that he is a physician, comedian, and TV host. Therefore, the two statements can coexist without contradiction."
