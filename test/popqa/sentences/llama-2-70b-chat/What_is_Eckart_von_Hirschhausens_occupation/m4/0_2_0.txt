  "explanation": "The statements about Eckart von Hirschhausen's occupation are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he specializes in internal medicine and has worked in various hospitals and clinics in Germany, while the second statement adds cardiology to his specialization. While it is possible that he has expanded his specialization to include cardiology since the first statement was made, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
