  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Queen Victoria are not contradictory, but statement 2 is incorrect. The first statement correctly identifies Victoria, Princess Royal as the mother of Queen Victoria and provides additional information about her. However, statement 2 is not accurate as there is no evidence to suggest that Victoria, Princess Royal was ruled by her husband, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. In fact, historical records suggest that their marriage was a happy one and they had a close relationship. Therefore, statement 2 should be disregarded as it is not supported by historical evidence."
