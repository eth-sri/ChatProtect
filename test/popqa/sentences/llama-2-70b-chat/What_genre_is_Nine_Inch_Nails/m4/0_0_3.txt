  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Nine Inch Nails are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the band's music incorporates elements of industrial rock and electronic music, but also note that their sound has evolved to include other genres such as ambient and synth-pop. The second statement is simply a more concise version of the first, emphasizing the atmospheric and experimental aspects of Nine Inch Nails' music. Overall, both statements support the idea that Nine Inch Nails cannot be easily categorized into a single genre."
