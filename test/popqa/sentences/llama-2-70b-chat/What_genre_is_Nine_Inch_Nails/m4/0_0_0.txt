  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Nine Inch Nails are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that while the band is primarily considered industrial rock, their sound has evolved to incorporate elements of other genres. Statement 2 simply states that Nine Inch Nails is an industrial rock band, which is consistent with their primary classification. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
