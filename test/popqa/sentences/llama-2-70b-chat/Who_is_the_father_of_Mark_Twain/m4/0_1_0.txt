  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Mark Twain are not contradictory. Both statements agree that John Marshall Clemens was the father of Mark Twain. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about John Marshall Clemens' occupation as a merchant and his role in Samuel Clemens' early life, while statement 2 only mentions his occupation as a lawyer and a farmer."
