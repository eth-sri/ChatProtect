  "explanation": "The two statements about Chrome's genre are not contradictory. Both statements mention electroclash as a genre associated with Chrome's music, but they provide different descriptions of the genre. The first statement describes electroclash as a combination of punk, new wave, and electronic music, while the second statement emphasizes the use of synthesizers and drum machines in a revival of 1980s new wave and synthpop. These descriptions complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of Chrome's genre."
