Statement 1 provides additional information about Augustine Washington's family, specifically that he had a son named George who was born in 1732. Statement 2 simply restates the fact that Augustine Washington married Mary Ball in 1730. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Augustine Washington is the father of George Washington."
