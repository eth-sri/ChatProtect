  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of George Washington are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Augustine Washington and his family, but they do not contradict each other. Statement 1 explains that Augustine Washington married Mary Ball and had a son named George in 1732, while Statement 2 provides the specific date and location of George's birth. Both statements support the fact that Augustine Washington is the father of George Washington."
