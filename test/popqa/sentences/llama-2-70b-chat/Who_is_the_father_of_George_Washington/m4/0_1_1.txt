  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of George Washington are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Augustine Washington, who is confirmed as the father of George Washington in the initial text. Statement 1 provides more specific details about Augustine Washington's birth year and his occupation as a planter and justice of the peace, while Statement 2 simply reiterates his occupation and location. Both statements support the fact that Augustine Washington was indeed the father of George Washington."
