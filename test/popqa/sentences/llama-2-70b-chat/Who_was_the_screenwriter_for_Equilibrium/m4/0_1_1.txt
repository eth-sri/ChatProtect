  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for Equilibrium are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Kurt Wimmer's work as a screenwriter on other films. While statement 1 mentions The Sphere, The Thomas Crown Affair, and Salt, statement 2 mentions The 13th Warrior and Ultraviolet. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide different examples of Kurt Wimmer's work as a screenwriter."
