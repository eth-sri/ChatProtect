  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of Space Battleship Yamato are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 identifies the series as a space opera, which typically focuses on epic space adventures and political conflicts. On the other hand, statement 2 categorizes it as a mecha genre, which typically features giant robots or machines controlled by humans. These two genres have distinct characteristics and themes, making it impossible for Space Battleship Yamato to fall under both simultaneously."
