  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Redeployment are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Phil Klay, the author of Redeployment, and his background as a veteran who served in Iraq. The only difference is the use of the word \"former\" in statement 2, which implies that Klay is no longer serving in the Marine Corps. However, this does not contradict the fact that he is a veteran who served in Iraq."
