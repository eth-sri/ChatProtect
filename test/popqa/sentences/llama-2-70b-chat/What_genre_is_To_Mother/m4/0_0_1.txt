  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of To Mother are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a complete sentence that identifies To Mother as a novel belonging to the genre of magical realism. Statement 2 is a rephrased version of the same information, using a semi-colon to separate the subject (To Mother) from the verb (belongs) and adding the descriptor \"magic\" to \"realism.\" Both statements convey the same information and are consistent with each other."
