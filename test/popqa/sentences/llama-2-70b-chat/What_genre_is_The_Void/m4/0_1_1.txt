  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Void are not contradictory, but rather offer different perspectives on how the film can be classified. Statement 1 suggests that the film falls under the subgenre of science fiction horror due to its combination of horror, sci-fi, and mystery elements. Statement 2, on the other hand, simply states that the film can be classified as a horror film due to its horror elements. Both statements acknowledge the presence of horror elements in the film, but statement 1 provides a more specific subgenre classification."
