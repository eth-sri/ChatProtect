  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Ledge? are not contradictory. While the first statement acknowledges that the screenwriter is not explicitly stated, it provides information about the person credited with the film's story. The second statement also provides information about the film's story credit, but notes that it is from an anonymous source. Both statements are consistent in their focus on the story credit rather than the screenwriter credit."
