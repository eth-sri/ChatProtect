Statement 1 provides additional information about the film's story being credited to Chris Gorak, while Statement 2 simply reiterates that Chris Gorak is known for his work on the film \"Right at Your Door.\" Both statements are consistent with the fact that the screenwriter for The Ledge is not explicitly stated in the film's credits."
