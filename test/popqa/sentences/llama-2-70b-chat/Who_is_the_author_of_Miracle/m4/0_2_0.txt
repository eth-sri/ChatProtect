  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of \"Miracle\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about the publication history of the hymn and confirms that the authorship is not attributed. Statement 2 simply states that the author is referred to as Anonymous, which is consistent with the idea that the author is unknown. Both statements support the idea that the author of \"Miracle\" is not explicitly stated."
