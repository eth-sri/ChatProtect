  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies are not contradictory. Both statements identify Martin Scorsese as the screenwriter for the film. The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the word \"himself\" in statement 1, which emphasizes that Scorsese wrote the screenplay for the film himself."
