  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of 1983? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the company \"Uelm Doneu\" was formed by Terry Gilliam and Jim Beach, while Statement 2 claims that it was formed by Terry Gilliam and Aron Warner. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the formation of the company that produced the film."
