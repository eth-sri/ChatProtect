  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Iphicles are contradictory. The first statement states that Iphicles is the son of King Aetes and his wife, while the second statement states that Iphicles is the son of Hercules. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different answers to the same question. Therefore, they are contradictory."
