  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of On the Beach? are contradictory. The beginning of the text states that the director of On the Beach is Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, which is incorrect. However, statement 1 correctly identifies Stanley Kramer as the director of the 1959 film On the Beach. Statement 2 also confirms that Stanley Kramer directed a film adaptation of the novel On the Beach. Therefore, the beginning of the text and statement 1 are contradictory."
