  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert are not contradictory. While Statement 1 provides background information about the founding of the Carmelite Order and their initial way of life as hermits on Mount Carmel, Statement 2 emphasizes the continuity of the Carmelite tradition with the prophets of the Old Testament, particularly Elijah. Both statements acknowledge that the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert is a set of guidelines for the spiritual life and practice of the Carmelite Order, and that it is attributed to Saint Albert of Jerusalem."
