  "prefix": " The Carmelite Rule of St. Albert is attributed to Saint Albert of Jerusalem, who was a 12th-century Catholic bishop and a prominent figure in the Carmelite Order. He was appointed as the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1206 and served in that position until his death in 1214. The Carmelite Rule of St. Albert is a set of guidelines for the spiritual life and practice of the Carmelite Order, which was founded by a group of hermits who lived on Mount Carmel in Palestine.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert do not contradict each other. They both acknowledge that the rule was written by Saint Albert of Jerusalem, but they differ in the number of chapters that the rule is divided into and the specific aspects of the spiritual life that are covered in each chapter. These differences do not affect the attribution of the rule to Saint Albert."
