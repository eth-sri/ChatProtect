  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Carmelite Rule of St. Albert are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Saint Albert of Jerusalem, who is attributed as the author of the rule. The first statement mentions that he was a Catholic bishop and a prominent figure in the Carmelite Order, while also providing information about his tenure as the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and his death in 1214. The second statement simply clarifies that he was appointed as the Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1206."
