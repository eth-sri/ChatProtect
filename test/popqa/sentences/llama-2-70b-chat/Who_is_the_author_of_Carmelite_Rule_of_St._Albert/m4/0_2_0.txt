  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert are not contradictory. While the first statement provides background information about the author, Saint Albert of Jerusalem, and the context in which the rule was developed, the second statement emphasizes the enduring significance of the rule as a guiding document for the Carmelite Order. Both statements contribute to a fuller understanding of the rule and its place in the history of the Carmelite tradition."
