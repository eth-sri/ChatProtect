  "prefix": " The Carmelite Rule of St. Albert is attributed to Saint Albert of Jerusalem, who was a 12th-century Catholic bishop and a prominent figure in the Carmelite Order. He was appointed as the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1206 and served in that position until his death in 1214. The Carmelite Rule of St. Albert is a set of guidelines for the spiritual life and practice of the Carmelite Order, which was founded by a group of hermits who lived on Mount Carmel in Palestine. The rule is divided into 12 chapters and covers various aspects of the spiritual life, including prayer, fasting, silence, and service to others. St. Albert is considered the author of the Carmelite Rule because he was instrumental in organizing and codifying the practices of the Carmelite hermits into a formal rule.",
