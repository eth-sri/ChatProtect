  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Saint Albert of Jerusalem is the author of the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert and that it is a set of guidelines for the spiritual life and practice of the Carmelite Order. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional context about the origins of the Carmelite Order, while statement 2 focuses solely on Saint Albert's role in creating the rule."
