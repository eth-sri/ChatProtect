While Statement 1 provides more specific details about the content of the rule, both statements agree that the rule was written by Saint Albert of Jerusalem and covers various aspects of the spiritual life, including prayer and fasting. Statement 2 also mentions community life, which is not explicitly mentioned in Statement 1, but this does not contradict the information provided in either statement."
