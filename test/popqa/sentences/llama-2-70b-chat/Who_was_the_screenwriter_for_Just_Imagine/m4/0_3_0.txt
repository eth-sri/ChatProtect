The first statement provides information about Sam Mintz being the screenwriter for the film and his prolific career in writing for both silent and sound films. The second statement adds to this information by specifying that Mintz also wrote for two other Marx Brothers' films, \"Monkey Business\" and \"Duck Soup.\" The two statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Mintz's career as a screenwriter."
