  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Q? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Michael Tolkin was the screenwriter for the movie \"Q\" (1996), while statement 2 claims that Jonathan Glazer was the screenwriter for the movie Q. Since they are referring to the same movie, they cannot both be true. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
