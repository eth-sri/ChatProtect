  "prefix": " Alt is short for \"alternative,\" and it can refer to a wide range of genres that are alternative to mainstream music. The term \"alt\" was first used in the 1980s to describe alternative rock, which was a genre that emerged as a reaction against mainstream rock music. Today, the term \"alt\" can refer to a variety of genres that are considered alternative to mainstream music, including:\n\n1. Alternative rock: This genre includes bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Radiohead, who rejected the glam metal and pop-metal of the 1980s and instead created a sound that was raw, introspective, and often politically charged. 2. Indie rock: This genre includes bands like Arcade Fire, The Strokes, and Vampire Weekend, who are often characterized by their DIY ethos, experimental sound, and lack of major label support. 3. Grunge: This genre, popularized by bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden, emerged in Seattle in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is characterized by its heavy, distorted guitar sound, introspective lyrics, and flannel shirts. 4. Punk: This genre, which emerged in the 1970s, is characterized by its fast tempo, rebellious attitude, and anti-establishment lyrics.",
