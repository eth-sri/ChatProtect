Alternative rock: This genre includes bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Radiohead, who rejected the glam metal and pop-metal of the 1980s and instead created a sound that was raw, introspective, and often politically charged. 2. Indie rock: This genre includes bands like Arcade Fire, The Strokes, and Vampire Weekend, who are often characterized by their DIY ethos, experimental sound, and lack of major label support. 3. Grunge: This genre, popularized by bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden, emerged in Seattle in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
