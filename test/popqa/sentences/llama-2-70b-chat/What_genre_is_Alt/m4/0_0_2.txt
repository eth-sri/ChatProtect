  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Alt? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that Alt can refer to a wide range of genres that are alternative to mainstream music, while Statement 2 specifically identifies it as alternative rock. While alternative rock is certainly a genre that falls under the umbrella of Alt, it is not the only genre that can be considered alternative. Therefore, the two statements present different perspectives on the genre of Alt."
