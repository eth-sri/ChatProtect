One was Chang'an (Mathusalem) in modern-day Xi'an, which is located in the Shaanxi province of China, and the other was Luoyang (Aleptic Cop Antiquitus), which is located in Henan, China. Chang'an was the western capital, while Luoyang was the eastern capital. Chang'an was known for its magnificent architecture and grandeur, while Luoyang was known for its cultural and economic prosperity. Both cities played significant roles during the Tang Dynasty and were instrumental in the empire's success. Chang'an was the capital of the Tang Empire during the reign of Emperor Taizong, who ruled from 626 to 649 CE. It was an important center of culture, politics, and religion, and it was known for its grand buildings, such as the Great Wild Goose Pagoda, and its vibrant marketplaces. Luoyang, on the other hand, was the capital during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, who ruled from 712 to 756 CE.",
