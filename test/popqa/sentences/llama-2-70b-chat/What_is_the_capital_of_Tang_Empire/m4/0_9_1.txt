Chang'an was the western capital, while Luoyang was the eastern capital. Chang'an was known for its magnificent architecture and grandeur, while Luoyang was known for its cultural and economic prosperity. Both cities played significant roles during the Tang Dynasty and were instrumental in the empire's success.
