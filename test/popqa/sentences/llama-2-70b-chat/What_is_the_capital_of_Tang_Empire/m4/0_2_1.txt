Statement 1 provides additional information about the two capitals, specifying their geographical locations within the empire. Statement 2 simply reiterates that Luoyang was one of the two capitals, without providing any new information. Both statements are consistent with the fact that the Tang Empire had two capitals, Chang'an and Luoyang."
