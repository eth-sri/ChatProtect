  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While Oxford is not a capital city, it is still a city located in the south-east of England, in the county of Oxfordshire, and it is also known as a university town in south-east England. The prompt did not ask specifically for the capital city of a particular region or country, so both statements provide relevant information about Oxford."
