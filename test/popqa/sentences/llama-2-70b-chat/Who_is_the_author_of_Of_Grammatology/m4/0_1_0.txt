  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Of Grammatology are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the book, including its original French title and year of publication, while Statement 2 simply confirms that Of Grammatology is indeed a book. Both statements are consistent with the initial statement that Jacques Derrida is the author of the book."
