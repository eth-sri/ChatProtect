  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of Of Grammatology are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the book, including its original French title and the fact that it was written by Derrida. Statement 2 simply confirms the year of its first publication. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Jacques Derrida is the author of Of Grammatology."
