  "explanation": "The statements about the plot of the film \"Out of the Blue\" are contradictory, but they do not contradict the statement about the screenwriter. The first statement describes the film as a drama about a 15-year-old girl who becomes involved with a group of drug dealers in Vancouver, while the second statement describes it as a drama about a 15-year-old girl who becomes involved with a rebellious gang of teenagers in a small Canadian town. However, both statements agree that the film is a drama and features a 15-year-old girl as the main character."
