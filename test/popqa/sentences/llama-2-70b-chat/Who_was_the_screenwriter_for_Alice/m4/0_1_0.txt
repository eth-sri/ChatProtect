  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Alice? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about Woody Allen's involvement in the film as both the writer and director, as well as the actors who starred in it. Statement 2 simply reiterates that Mia Farrow was one of the film's stars. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Woody Allen was the screenwriter for the film."
