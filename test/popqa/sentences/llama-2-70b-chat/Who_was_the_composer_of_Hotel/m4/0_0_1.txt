  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they are not directly related to the prompt either. Statement 1 suggests that there is no composer named \"Hotel,\" which is true since \"Hotel\" is not a person's name but a title of a song or a piece of music. Statement 2 is a personal introduction that does not provide any information about the composer of \"Hotel.\" Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other, but they do not answer the prompt either."
