  "explanation": "The statements about the author of \"Empire and Communications\" are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Harold Innis is one of the founders of the field of media studies and that he wrote extensively on the role of communication in shaping society and culture. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which emphasizes Innis's work on the role of media in shaping culture and society. However, this does not contradict the first statement, which also acknowledges Innis's influential work on the topic of media and its impact on society."
