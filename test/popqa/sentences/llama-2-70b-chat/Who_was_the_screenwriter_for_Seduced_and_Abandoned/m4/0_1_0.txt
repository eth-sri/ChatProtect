  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who was the screenwriter for Seduced and Abandoned are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the director Liv Ullmann did not write the screenplay, while Statement 2 suggests that the film was directed by James Ivory, who may have also written the screenplay. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
