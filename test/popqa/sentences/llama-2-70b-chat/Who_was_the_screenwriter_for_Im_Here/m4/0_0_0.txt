  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for I'm Here? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Patrick Levy was the screenwriter for the film \"I'm Here\", while statement 2 claims that Spike Jonze was the screenwriter for the same film. Since the two statements provide different answers to the same question, they cannot both be true at the same time."
