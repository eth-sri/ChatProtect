  "prefix": " The producer of the film \"Une fille et des fusils\" is not explicitly stated. However, the film was produced by the French film production company, Les Productions de la Gu\u00e9ville, which was founded by the film's director, Jean-Luc Godard, and his colleagues. Les Productions de la Gu\u00e9ville was established in the early 1960s and was known for producing a number of influential French New Wave films, including \"Une fille et des fusils,\" \"Breathless\" (1960), and \"The Little Soldier\" (1963). The company was instrumental in the development of the French New Wave movement, which sought to break away from traditional Hollywood filmmaking conventions and explore new styles and themes in cinema. \"Une fille et des fusils\" was released in 1961 and starred Anna Karina, who was a prominent actress and collaborator of Godard's during this time. The film tells the story of a young woman who is torn between her love for a left-wing intellectual and her involvement with a group of right-wing radicals.",
