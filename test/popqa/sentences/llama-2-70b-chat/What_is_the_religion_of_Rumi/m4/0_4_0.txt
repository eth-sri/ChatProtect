Statement 1 emphasizes Rumi's devotion to Islam and his references to Islamic theology and practices in his poetry and writings. Statement 2 highlights the spiritual themes that Rumi explored in his work, which go beyond the specific tenets of Islam and encompass broader spiritual concepts. Both statements provide different perspectives on Rumi's religious beliefs and practices, but they do not contradict each other."
