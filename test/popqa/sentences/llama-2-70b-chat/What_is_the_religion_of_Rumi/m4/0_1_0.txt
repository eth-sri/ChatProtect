  "explanation": "The statements about Rumi's birthplace are contradictory, but they do not address the prompt of his religion. The first statement states that Rumi was born in present-day Afghanistan and lived most of his life in Konya, Turkey, while the second statement claims that he was born and lived in what is now modern-day Turkey. However, neither statement provides information about Rumi's religion."
