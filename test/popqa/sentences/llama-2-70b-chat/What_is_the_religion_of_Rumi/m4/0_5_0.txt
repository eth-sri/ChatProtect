  "explanation": "The statements about Rumi's religion are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that Rumi was a devout follower of the Shia branch of Islam, while the second statement suggests that his spiritual views were not limited to any particular sect or denomination. This means that while Rumi was a Muslim and followed the Shia branch of Islam, his spiritual beliefs and teachings were not confined to any one religion or sect. Rumi's poetry and writings reflect a universal spirituality that transcends religious boundaries and speaks to people of all faiths."
