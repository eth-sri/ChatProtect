While Rumi was a devout follower of the Shia branch of Islam, he also believed in the unity of all religions and the universal message of love and spirituality that underlies them. He had a deep respect for all religions and spiritual traditions, which is reflected in his poetry and writings. Therefore, both statements are true and complement each other."
