  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Doomwatch? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the director of Doomwatch was not a single person, but rather a team of directors who worked on different episodes of the series, while statement 2 claims that the director of Doomwatch was Gerry Anderson, a single individual. Therefore, these statements cannot both be true at the same time."
