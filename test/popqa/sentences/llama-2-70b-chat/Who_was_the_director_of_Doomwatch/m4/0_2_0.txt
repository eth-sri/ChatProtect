  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Doomwatch are contradictory. The first statement explains that the director of Doomwatch was not a single person, but rather a team of directors who worked on different episodes of the series, and lists several of the directors who worked on the show. The second statement also lists some directors who worked on Doomwatch, but includes different names than the first statement and implies that there was a single director rather than a team."
