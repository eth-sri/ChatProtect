  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Doomwatch are not contradictory. Both statements explain that the director of Doomwatch was not a single person, but rather a team of directors who worked on different episodes of the series. Statement 1 emphasizes that the team of directors worked on different episodes, while statement 2 highlights that the show had a different director for each episode, which explains why the director was not consistently credited. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the directorship of Doomwatch."
