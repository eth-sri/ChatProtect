Both statements provide a list of directors who worked on different episodes of the series, but they include different names. Statement 1 lists Paddy Russell, Eric Hills, Roger Tucker, Peter Sasdy, Terence Dudley, and David Maloney, while Statement 2 lists Terence Dudley, Douglas Camfield, and Philip Dudley. Therefore, the statements complement each other by providing additional information about the directors of Doomwatch."
