  "explanation": "The statements about Mike Flanagan's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that he is a filmmaker, specifically a director, screenwriter, and editor. The only difference is that statement 1 provides a broader overview of his work, including the genres he specializes in and the range of successful films and TV shows he has directed, while statement 2 focuses specifically on his success in the horror genre. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about Mike Flanagan's occupation."
