  "explanation": "The statements about In what city was Israel Horowitz born? are contradictory because they provide two different cities as the birthplace of Israel Horowitz. One statement claims that he was born in Vienna, Austria, while the other states that he was born in Winnipeg, Canada. Since these two cities are located in different countries and continents, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
