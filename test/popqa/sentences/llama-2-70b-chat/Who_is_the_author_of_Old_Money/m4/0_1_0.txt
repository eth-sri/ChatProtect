  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Old Money? are contradictory because they provide different publication dates for the novel. Statement 1 states that the novel was published in 1975, while Statement 2 states that it was published in 1985. Therefore, only one of the statements can be true, and they cannot both be true at the same time."
