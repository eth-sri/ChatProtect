  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Lab? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 indicates that The Lab is not a real book, therefore there cannot be an author for it. However, Statement 2 suggests that there is a book called The Lab, but the author is not specified. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
