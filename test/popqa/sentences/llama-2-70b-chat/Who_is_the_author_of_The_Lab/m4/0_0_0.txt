  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Lab? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same message that the author of The Lab cannot be identified or provided as it is not a real book. The first statement clarifies that the book does not exist, while the second statement simply states that the author's name cannot be provided. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
