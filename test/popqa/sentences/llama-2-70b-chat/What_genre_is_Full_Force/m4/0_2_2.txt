Both statements acknowledge that Full Force incorporates elements of multiple genres, making it difficult to categorize them into a single genre. Statement 1 specifically mentions funk, soul, and rock, while Statement 2 reiterates the same idea without specifying any particular genres. Overall, both statements support the idea that Full Force's music is genre-bending and defies easy categorization."
