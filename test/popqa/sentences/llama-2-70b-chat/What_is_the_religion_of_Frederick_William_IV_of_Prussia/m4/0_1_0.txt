  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Frederick William IV of Prussia are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that he was likely raised in the Lutheran faith, which was the predominant religion in Prussia at the time. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions the Lutheran denomination as the predominant Protestant denomination, while statement 2 refers to the Lutheran tradition more broadly. However, both statements convey the same overall message about Frederick William IV's religious background."
