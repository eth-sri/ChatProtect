  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Frederick William IV of Prussia are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize his strong connection to the Lutheran faith and his support for the Lutheran Church. The only difference is in the wording, with one statement using the term \"religious convictions\" and the other using \"devotion.\" However, both statements convey the same idea that Frederick William IV was a devout Lutheran."
