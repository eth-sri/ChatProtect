  "explanation": "The statements about In what city was Roger Gaudry born? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. One statement claims that he was born in Paris, France, while the other states that he was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Both statements cannot be true at the same time, so they contradict each other."
