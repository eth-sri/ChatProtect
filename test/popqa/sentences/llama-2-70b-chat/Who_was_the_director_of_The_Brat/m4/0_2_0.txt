  "explanation": "Statement 1 is contradictory to the beginning of the text, which clearly states that John Francis Dillon was the director of The Brat. While Chaplin did write and direct some of his own films, in this case, he only produced the film along with Dillon. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2, on the other hand, is not contradictory as it correctly states that Chaplin was one of the producers of the film."
