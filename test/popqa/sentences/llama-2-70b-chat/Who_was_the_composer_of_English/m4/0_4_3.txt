  "prefix": " It is not accurate to say that there was a single \"composer\" of the English language. English has evolved over time through a process of linguistic change, and it has been influenced by various languages, including Old English, Middle English, and Latin. The development of Modern English is credited to several factors, including the Norman Conquest of 1066, the introduction of the printing press in the 15th century, and the spread of English as a global language in the 18th and 19th centuries. There have been many influential linguists, lexicographers, and writers throughout history who have contributed to the development and standardization of English.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Who was the composer of English? are not contradictory. The first statement explains that there was not a single composer of the English language, but rather it evolved over time through various influences and contributions from many individuals. The second statement provides an example of one of those individuals, William Caxton, who played a significant role in the development of English by introducing the printing press to England in the 15th century. Both statements support the idea that the English language was shaped by multiple factors and people throughout history."
