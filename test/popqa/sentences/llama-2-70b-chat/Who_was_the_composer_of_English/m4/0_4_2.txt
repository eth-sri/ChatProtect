  "prefix": " It is not accurate to say that there was a single \"composer\" of the English language. English has evolved over time through a process of linguistic change, and it has been influenced by various languages, including Old English, Middle English, and Latin. The development of Modern English is credited to several factors, including the Norman Conquest of 1066, the introduction of the printing press in the 15th century, and the spread of English as a global language in the 18th and 19th centuries. There have been many influential linguists, lexicographers, and writers throughout history who have contributed to the development and standardization of English.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of English are not contradictory. The first statement explains that English has evolved over time through various influences and contributions from many individuals, while the second statement provides examples of some notable figures who have played a significant role in shaping the language. Both statements support the idea that there is no single composer of English, but rather a collective effort over time."
