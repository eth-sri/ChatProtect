  "prefix": " It is not accurate to say that there was a single \"composer\" of the English language. English has evolved over time through a process of linguistic change, and it has been influenced by various languages, including Old English, Middle English, and Latin. The development of Modern English is credited to several factors, including the Norman Conquest of 1066, the introduction of the printing press in the 15th century, and the spread of English as a global language in the 18th and 19th centuries. There have been many influential linguists, lexicographers, and writers throughout history who have contributed to the development and standardization of English.",

Both statements are complementary and provide different perspectives on the topic."
