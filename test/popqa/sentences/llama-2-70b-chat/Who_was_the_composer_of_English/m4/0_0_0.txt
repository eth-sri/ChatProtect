  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of English? are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that the English language was not created or composed by a single individual. While the first statement emphasizes the inaccuracy of attributing the creation of English to a single composer, the second statement outright denies the existence of a single composer. Both statements agree that the English language is a product of historical and cultural evolution, rather than the work of a single person."
