While the first statement acknowledges that there was no single composer of the English language, it provides a brief overview of the various factors that contributed to its evolution. The second statement specifically highlights the Norman Conquest of 1066 as a significant event in the development of Modern English. Both statements are accurate and provide different perspectives on the topic."
