  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the National Assembly in France, with statement 1 explaining that it is part of a bicameral Parliament alongside the Senate, and statement 2 emphasizing that it is the directly elected chamber of the Parliament. Together, these statements provide a more complete understanding of the National Assembly's role and structure within the French government."
