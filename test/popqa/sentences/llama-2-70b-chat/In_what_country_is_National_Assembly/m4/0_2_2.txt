  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is National Assembly?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the composition of the National Assembly in France. The first statement highlights that the deputies are elected by the people for a five-year term, while the second statement emphasizes that each deputy represents a constituency. Both statements complement each other and do not contradict the initial statement about the location of the National Assembly in France."
