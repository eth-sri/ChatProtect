  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Plutus? are not contradictory. While the first statement identifies Aristophanes as the author of Plutus, the second statement provides additional information about the play itself, specifically its satirical nature and focus on social and political issues in ancient Greece. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the author and his work."
