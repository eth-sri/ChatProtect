  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for Superstar are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the director and producer may have also been involved in writing the screenplay, but there is no definitive information to confirm this. Statement 2 simply states that the writer is unknown, which is consistent with the fact that the credits do not attribute the screenplay to a specific person. Both statements acknowledge the lack of clarity around the identity of the screenwriter."
