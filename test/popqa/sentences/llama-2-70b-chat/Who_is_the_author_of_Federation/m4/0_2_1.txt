Both statements mention that the final version of the document was reviewed to ensure its accuracy and relevance, but they differ in the specific group of people who conducted the review. Statement 1 mentions a broad group of stakeholders, while Statement 2 mentions a panel of industry experts and thought leaders. Both groups could have been involved in the review process, and their inclusion does not contradict the fact that the document was a collaborative effort between multiple individuals and organizations."
