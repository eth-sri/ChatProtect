  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Gautama Buddha are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Queen Maya Devi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama, who later became known as the Buddha. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"later\" in the second statement, which simply emphasizes the fact that Siddhartha Gautama did not become the Buddha immediately after his birth."
