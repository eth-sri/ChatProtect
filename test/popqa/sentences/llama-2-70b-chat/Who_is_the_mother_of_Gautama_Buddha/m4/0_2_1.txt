  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Gautama Buddha are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Queen Maya Devi and her dream of a white elephant entering her womb, which was interpreted as a sign of her son's special destiny. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that Maya Devi was a devout and virtuous queen, while statement 2 emphasizes that her son would be a great spiritual leader. However, both statements are consistent with the traditional belief that Maya Devi was the mother of Gautama Buddha."
