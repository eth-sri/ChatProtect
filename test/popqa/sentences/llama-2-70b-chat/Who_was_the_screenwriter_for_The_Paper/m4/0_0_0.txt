  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Paper? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Ron Hutchinson was the screenwriter for the film, while statement 2 claims that Ron Howard was the screenwriter. Since the two statements provide different names for the screenwriter, they cannot both be true at the same time."
