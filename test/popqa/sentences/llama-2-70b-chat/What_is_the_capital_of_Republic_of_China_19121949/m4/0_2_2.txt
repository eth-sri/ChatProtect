The second statement provides additional information about the events that led to the capital being moved to Taipei in 1949, after the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland. The two statements provide a complete picture of the capital of the Republic of China during the specified time period and the events that led to its relocation."
