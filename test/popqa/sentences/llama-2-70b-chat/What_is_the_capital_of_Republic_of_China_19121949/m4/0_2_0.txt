  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Republic of China 1912-1949 are not contradictory, but they provide different information about the capital's location at different times. Statement 1 explains that the capital was moved to Taipei in 1949 after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, while Statement 2 states that the capital moved to Beijing in 1928. Therefore, both statements are true, but they refer to different periods in the history of the Republic of China."
