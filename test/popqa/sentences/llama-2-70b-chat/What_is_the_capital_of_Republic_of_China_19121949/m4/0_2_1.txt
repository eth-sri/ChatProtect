Statement 1 explains that the capital was moved to Taipei in 1949 after the establishment of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party of China. Statement 2 provides information about the ruling party of the Republic of China, which was the Kuomintang Party. Both statements provide additional information about the history of the Republic of China, but they do not contradict each other."
