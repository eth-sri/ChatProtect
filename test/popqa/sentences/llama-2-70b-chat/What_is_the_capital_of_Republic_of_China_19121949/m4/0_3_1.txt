Both statements mention the Republic of China government retreating to Taiwan after the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the mainland. Statement 1 adds that the government continued to claim to be the legitimate government of China, including the mainland. Neither statement contradicts the fact that Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1949 before the government moved to Taipei."
