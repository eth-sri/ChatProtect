  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Republic of China 1912-1949 are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the Republic of China government retreated to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that the government continued to claim legitimacy over the mainland, while statement 2 specifies that the government was led by Chiang Kai-shek. These are additional pieces of information that do not contradict the fact that the capital was moved from Nanjing to Taipei in 1949."
