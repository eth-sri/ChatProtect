  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the capital of Republic of China from 1912 to 1949 was Nanjing, but statement 1 adds that it was later moved to Taipei in 1949 after the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland. Statement 2 also mentions the move to Taipei in 1949, but does not provide the reason for the move. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional information about the change in capital."
