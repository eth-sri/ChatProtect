  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for \"Taxi\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Paul Schrader's career as a screenwriter and mention other notable films he has worked on. The only difference is that statement 1 includes \"American Gigolo\" as one of Schrader's notable works, while statement 2 does not mention it. However, this does not create a contradiction between the two statements."
