The first statement identifies Paul Schrader as the screenwriter for the film \"Taxi,\" and provides additional information about his career and the significance of the film in his body of work. The second statement identifies Martin Scorsese as the director of the film, which is a separate role from the screenwriter. Therefore, the two statements do not conflict with each other."
