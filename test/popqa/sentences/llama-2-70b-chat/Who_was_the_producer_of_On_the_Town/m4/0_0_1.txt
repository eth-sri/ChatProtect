  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of On the Town are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information, with the only difference being the order of the words. Statement 1 provides additional context about On the Town being a musical film, but it does not contradict Statement 2. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
