  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deivos are not contradictory, as both statements agree that the band's music is characterized by fast tempo and aggressive, guttural vocals. The only difference is that the first statement adds that the music also features complex guitar riffs, while the second statement does not mention this aspect. Therefore, both statements are consistent in describing Deivos as a band that plays brutal death metal with fast-paced and aggressive music."
