  "explanation": "The statements about the release year of Diabolis Interium are contradictory, but they do not contradict the statement about the genre of the album. The first statement correctly states that the album was released in 2004 and is considered a seminal work in the genre of black metal. The second statement is incorrect, as the album was not released in 2000. However, this does not affect the statement about the genre of the album."
