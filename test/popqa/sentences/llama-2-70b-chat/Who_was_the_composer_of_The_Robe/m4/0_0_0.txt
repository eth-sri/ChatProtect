  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of The Robe are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. Statement 1 claims that Alfred Newman was the composer of the film score for The Robe, while statement 2 claims that Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa was the composer. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
