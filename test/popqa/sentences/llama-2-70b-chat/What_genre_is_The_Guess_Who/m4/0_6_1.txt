  "explanation": "The statements about The Guess Who's genre are not contradictory. While the first statement identifies classic rock as one of the genres that the band's music can be categorized into, the second statement adds to this by highlighting the band's experimentation with a harder, more aggressive sound that leans towards hard rock. Both statements are consistent with the idea that The Guess Who's music can be classified as a mix of rock, pop, and rhythm and blues, with elements of classic rock and hard rock present in their repertoire."
