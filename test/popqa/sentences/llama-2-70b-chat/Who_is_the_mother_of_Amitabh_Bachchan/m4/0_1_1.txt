  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Amitabh Bachchan are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Teji Bachchan was a Punjabi Sikh woman. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about her being married to Harivansh Rai Bachchan, while statement 2 does not. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
