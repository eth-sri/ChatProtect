  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of A Foreign Affair are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that David O. Selznick was the producer, while statement 2 claims that Billy Wilder was the producer. Since they are two different individuals, only one of them can be the actual producer of the film."
