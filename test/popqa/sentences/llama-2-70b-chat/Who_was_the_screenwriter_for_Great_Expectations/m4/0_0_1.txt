  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they do not directly answer the prompt of who the screenwriter for \"Great Expectations\" was. Statement 1 acknowledges that the novel was adapted into a screenplay by various screenwriters, but does not specify who wrote the screenplay for any particular production. Statement 2 mentions the film adaptation directed by David Lean, but does not mention the screenwriter. Therefore, the prompt remains unanswered."
