  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Ancient Evenings? are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Toni Morrison as the author of the book, but the second statement is incorrect in describing the book as a collection of three short stories about ancient Egyptians. In fact, the book is a single novel that follows the life of an ancient Egyptian nobleman named Menenhetet."
