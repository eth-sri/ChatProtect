  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Front Page are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Howard Hughes was the producer, while Statement 2 provides information about the play's writers. The two statements do not address the same aspect of the film's production, and therefore do not provide consistent information about the producer."
