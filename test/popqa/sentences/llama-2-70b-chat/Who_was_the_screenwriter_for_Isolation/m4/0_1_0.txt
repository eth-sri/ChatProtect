Both statements mention William Monahan as the screenwriter for \"Isolation\" and his work on other films such as \"The Departed\" and \"The Kingdom of Heaven.\" The only difference is that statement 1 adds that Monahan made his directorial debut with \"Isolation,\" while statement 2 does not mention this fact."
