  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Afonso II of Portugal are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Urraca of Castile and her marriage to Afonso I of Portugal, but they do not contradict each other. Statement 1 emphasizes Urraca's status as a member of the Castilian royal family and the political nature of her marriage, while statement 2 highlights the role of her father, Alfonso VII of Castile, in arranging the marriage for political reasons. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of Urraca's background and the circumstances of her marriage to Afonso I."
