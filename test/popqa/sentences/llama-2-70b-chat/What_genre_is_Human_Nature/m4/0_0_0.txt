  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Human Nature? are contradictory. Statement 1 describes Human Nature as a pop boy band with music that can be classified as pop and R&B, while Statement 2 simply describes them as a pop band. The inclusion of \"boy band\" and the mention of R&B in Statement 1 suggests a more specific genre classification than the broad label of \"pop\" in Statement 2."
