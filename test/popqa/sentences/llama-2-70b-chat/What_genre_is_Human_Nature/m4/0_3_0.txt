  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Human Nature are contradictory. The first statement mentions the song \"Keep on Rockin',\" which is not a song by Human Nature, while the second statement correctly lists their popular song \"Slam Dunk (Da Funk).\" Additionally, the first statement does not mention \"Slam Dunk (Da Funk),\" which is one of their most well-known songs. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be accurate."
