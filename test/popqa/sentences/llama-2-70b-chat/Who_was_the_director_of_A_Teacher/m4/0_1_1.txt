  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of A Teacher? are contradictory. The first statement says that the director is not explicitly stated, while the second statement claims that HBO released the film in 2013. However, the film was actually released in 2020, as stated in the third sentence of the prompt. Therefore, the second statement is incorrect and contradicts the correct information provided in the prompt."
