  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Weimar Republic are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a historical context for the Weimar Republic and confirms that Berlin was its capital throughout its existence. Statement 2 adds further information by specifying that Berlin was also the seat of the German government during the Weimar Republic. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the capital of the Weimar Republic."
