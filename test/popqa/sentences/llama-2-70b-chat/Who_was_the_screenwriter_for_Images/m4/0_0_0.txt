  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Images? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Robert Altman was the screenwriter for the film \"Images,\" while statement 2 claims that Suso Cecchi D'Amico was the screenwriter. Since the two statements provide different answers to the same question, they cannot both be true at the same time."
