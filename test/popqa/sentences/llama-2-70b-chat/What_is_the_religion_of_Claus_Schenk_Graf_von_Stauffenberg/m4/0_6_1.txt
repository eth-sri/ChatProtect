  "prefix": " Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg was a German army officer and conspirator who played a key role in the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on July 20, 1944. While von Stauffenberg was born into a noble family and was raised with a sense of duty to his country and its traditions, he did not have a strong religious background. Von Stauffenberg's family was not particularly religious, and he was not known to have had any strong personal religious beliefs. He was more focused on his military career and his sense of duty to his country than on religious matters. In fact, von Stauffenberg's involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler was motivated more by his sense of duty and moral outrage at the atrocities being committed by the Nazi regime than by any religious beliefs. He saw the assassination attempt as a way to stop the war and prevent further suffering and death, rather than as a religious obligation.",

Both statements support the idea that von Stauffenberg's actions were motivated more by his sense of duty and moral outrage than by any religious beliefs."
