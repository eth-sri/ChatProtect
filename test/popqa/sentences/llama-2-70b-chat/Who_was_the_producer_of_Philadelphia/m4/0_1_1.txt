  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Philadelphia are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Jonathan Demme, the producer of the movie Philadelphia. Statement 1 expands on his career as a filmmaker and lists some of his notable works, including Philadelphia and The Silence of the Lambs. Statement 2 simply reiterates that Demme was known for his work on Silence of the Lambs, which is another film he produced. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
