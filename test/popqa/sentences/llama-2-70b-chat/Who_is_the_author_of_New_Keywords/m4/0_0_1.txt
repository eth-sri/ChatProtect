  "explanation": "The statements about the author of New Keywords are not contradictory. Both statements identify Raymond Williams as the author of the book. Statement 1 provides additional information about Williams, describing him as a Welsh academic, novelist, and critic, while Statement 2 simply states that he wrote the book. However, both statements convey the same essential information about the authorship of New Keywords."
