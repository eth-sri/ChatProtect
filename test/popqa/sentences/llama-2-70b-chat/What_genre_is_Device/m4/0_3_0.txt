Both statements acknowledge that Device incorporates elements of electronic music into their sound, but they differ in the specific subgenres mentioned. Statement 1 mentions techno and trance, while statement 2 mentions techno and ambient. These are not mutually exclusive, as techno can be incorporated into both trance and ambient music.
