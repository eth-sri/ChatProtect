  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Bishop's Heir? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Katherine Kurtz as the author of the book, while statement 2 incorrectly identifies Patricia Cornwell as the author. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
