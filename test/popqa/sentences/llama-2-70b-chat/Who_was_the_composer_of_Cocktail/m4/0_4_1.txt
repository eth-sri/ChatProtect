The text states that the music for the movie Cocktail was composed by Harold Faltermeyer, Craig Safan, Christopher Lloyd, and John Parr, but statement 1 suggests that John Parr was the composer of the film's music. However, statement 2 contradicts this by stating that John Parr's hit single \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" was featured in the movie, but does not mention him as a composer for the film's music."
