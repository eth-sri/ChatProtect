  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"I Want to Break Free\" are not necessarily contradictory, but they do present different perspectives. Statement 1 focuses on the specific subgenre of pop music that the song belongs to, while Statement 2 simply identifies the band that created the song. It is possible for a song to belong to multiple genres or subgenres, and in this case, \"I Want to Break Free\" could be considered both a synth-pop song and a rock song. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather offer different ways of categorizing the song."
