  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"I Want to Break Free\" are not contradictory. Both statements describe the prominent use of a synthesizer in the song, which is a defining characteristic of the synth-pop genre. The first statement provides a broader definition of the genre and places the song within that category, while the second statement focuses specifically on the sound of the synthesizer riff in the song. Together, the statements provide complementary information about the genre and the song's musical characteristics."
