The first statement establishes that Paul Schrader was the screenwriter for Obsession, while the second statement provides additional information about Schrader's career by mentioning that he wrote the script for Taxi Driver, which was later directed by Martin Scorsese. Neither statement contradicts the other or provides conflicting information."
