  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Obsession? are contradictory. The first statement suggests that Scorsese agreed to direct \"Obsession\" after Schrader had written the script for \"Taxi Driver,\" while the second statement suggests that Scorsese promised to make \"Taxi Driver\" his next film before Schrader had even finished writing \"Obsession.\" Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
