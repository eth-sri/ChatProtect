The first statement explains that Martin Scorsese was originally supposed to direct the film but was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. The second statement confirms that Brian De Palma ended up directing the film instead. Both statements are consistent with Paul Schrader being the screenwriter for \"Obsession.\""
