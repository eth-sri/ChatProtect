The first statement simply identifies Paul Schrader as the screenwriter for the film \"Obsession.\" The second statement provides additional information about Schrader's career, specifically mentioning his screenplay for \"Taxi Driver\" and its critical acclaim. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about Schrader's work as a screenwriter."
