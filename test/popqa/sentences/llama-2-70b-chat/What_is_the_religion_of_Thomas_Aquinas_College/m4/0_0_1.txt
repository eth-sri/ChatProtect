  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Thomas Aquinas College are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the college is Catholic and follows the teachings and practices of Catholicism. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which is a repetition of the first statement in a more concise form. Therefore, both statements are consistent and accurate in describing the religion of Thomas Aquinas College."
