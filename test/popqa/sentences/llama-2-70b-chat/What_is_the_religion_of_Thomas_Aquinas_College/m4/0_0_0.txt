  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Thomas Aquinas College are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same message that the college is Catholic. The first statement provides additional information that the college is a Catholic liberal arts college, which implies that Catholicism is the religion of the college. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
