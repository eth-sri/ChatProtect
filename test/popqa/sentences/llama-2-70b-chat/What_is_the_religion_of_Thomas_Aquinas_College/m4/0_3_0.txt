  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Thomas Aquinas College are not contradictory. Both statements describe the college's curriculum, but they do so in slightly different ways. Statement 1 emphasizes the breadth of the curriculum, while Statement 2 emphasizes the focus on the works of St. Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic thinkers. However, both statements are consistent with the overall description of the college as a Catholic liberal arts institution that is faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church and rooted in the Catholic intellectual tradition."
