  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Thomas Aquinas College are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the college's commitment to providing a rigorous education in the liberal arts, including courses in philosophy, theology, literature, history, and the natural sciences. The first statement adds that the curriculum is designed to be broad, while the second statement emphasizes the rigor of the education. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of the college's Catholic identity and mission to form students who are committed to truth, wisdom, and virtue."
