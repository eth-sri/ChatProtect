He is often depicted as a mischievous and playful god who shoots arrows of love into the hearts of mortals, causing them to fall in love. 2. Aphrodite (Venus): In Greek mythology, Aphrodite (also known as Venus) is the goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality. She is often depicted as a beautiful and alluring goddess who is associated with the power of love and desire. 3.

  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Love? are not contradictory. While the text provides different interpretations of who could be the author of love, statement 1 adds another perspective from Christianity, where Jesus is seen as the embodiment of love. Statement 2 further elaborates on this perspective by emphasizing Jesus' selfless love. These statements do not contradict the other interpretations provided in the text, but rather add to the discussion of who could be the author of love."
