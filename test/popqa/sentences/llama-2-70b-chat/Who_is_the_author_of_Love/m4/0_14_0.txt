  "explanation": "The two statements about the author of love are not necessarily contradictory. While the first statement suggests that love may have a specific author or source, the second statement acknowledges that love is a complex and multifaceted force that cannot be fully understood or attributed to a single entity. Both statements offer different perspectives on the nature of love and its origins, but they do not necessarily contradict each other."
