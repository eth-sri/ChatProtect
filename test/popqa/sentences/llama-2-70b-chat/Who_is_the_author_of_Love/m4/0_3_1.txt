  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Love are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about Eros (Cupid), who is one of the possible authors of love. The first statement describes his role in Greek mythology as a god who causes mortals to fall in love, while the second statement describes his physical appearance as a winged youth carrying a bow and arrows. Both statements contribute to a fuller understanding of Eros as a potential author of love."
