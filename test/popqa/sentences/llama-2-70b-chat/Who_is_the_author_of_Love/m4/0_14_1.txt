Eros (Cupid): In Greek mythology, Eros (also known as Cupid) is the god of love and desire. He is often depicted as a mischievous and playful god who shoots arrows of love into the hearts of mortals, causing them to fall in love. 2. Aphrodite (Venus): In Greek mythology, Aphrodite (also known as Venus) is the goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality. She is often depicted as a beautiful and alluring goddess who is associated with the power of love and desire. 3. Elohim: In the Hebrew Bible, Elohim is the name used to refer to God when discussing creation and the relationship between God and humanity. Some interpretations suggest that Elohim is the author of love, as the creator of the universe and the source of all love. 4.

  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Love? are not contradictory. While the text presents various interpretations of who or what could be the author of love, the two additional statements suggest that love is a fundamental force of the universe and a universal force that transcends individual perspectives and beliefs. These statements do not necessarily contradict the previous interpretations, but rather suggest that love may be a concept that goes beyond any specific deity or belief system."
