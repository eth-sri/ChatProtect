  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Love? are not contradictory, but rather they present different perspectives on the topic. Statement 1 acknowledges that there is no clear consensus on who the author of Love is, and that different people may have different interpretations based on their own perspectives. Statement 2 provides a specific example of this debate, with some people attributing Love to William Shakespeare and others disagreeing with this attribution. Both statements recognize the ongoing debate and lack of a definitive answer to the question of who the author of Love is."
