  "explanation": "The statements about the author of \"The Fruits of Enlightenment\" are contradictory. Statement 1 includes the surname \"Kantpan\" which is not a known or recognized name, while Statement 2 correctly identifies the author as Immanuel Kant. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
