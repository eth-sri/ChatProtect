  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What is City of Brussels the capital of? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly states that the City of Brussels is the capital of the Brussels-Capital Region, which is one of the three regions of Belgium. However, Statement 2 incorrectly states that the City of Brussels is the capital of Belgium. In fact, while the City of Brussels is the capital of the Brussels-Capital Region, the capital of Belgium as a whole is Brussels, which encompasses not only the City of Brussels but also 18 other municipalities. Therefore, Statement 2 is incorrect and contradicts Statement 1."
