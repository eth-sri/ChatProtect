  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What is City of Brussels the capital of? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly states that City of Brussels is the capital of the Brussels-Capital Region, which is one of the three regions of Belgium. However, statement 2 is incorrect as the capital of Belgium is not the Brussels-Capital Region, but rather the City of Brussels itself. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other."
