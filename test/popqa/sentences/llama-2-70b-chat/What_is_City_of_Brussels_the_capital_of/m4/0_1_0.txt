However, Statement 2 is incorrect in stating that the Brussels-Capital Region is a federal state and the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is not a federal state, but rather a federal region within Belgium. The capital of Belgium is Brussels, which is located within the Brussels-Capital Region."
