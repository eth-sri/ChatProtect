  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Information? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that James Gleick is the author of The Information. The only difference is the inclusion of additional information in the first statement, which specifies that The Information is a book that covers the history, theory, and impact of information. Therefore, both statements are consistent and accurate."
