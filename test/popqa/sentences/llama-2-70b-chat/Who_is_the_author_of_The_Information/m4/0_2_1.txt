  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Information? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about James Gleick, the author of The Information, and his other notable works. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman, while statement 2 mentions The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. However, this does not contradict the fact that Gleick is the author of The Information."
