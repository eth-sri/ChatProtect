They provide different perspectives on how salvation can be achieved in different religions and belief systems. While Judaism emphasizes the study and practice of the Torah and following God's commandments, Christianity emphasizes faith in Jesus Christ as the savior and Islam emphasizes submission to Allah and following the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith. However, all three perspectives ultimately attribute the authorship of salvation to a higher power or deity."
