Statement 1 acknowledges that the concept of the author of salvation is subjective and varies depending on one's religious or spiritual tradition. Statement 2 suggests that God is the author of salvation, which is a belief held by many religious traditions. Therefore, while the two statements approach the topic from different angles, they do not necessarily contradict each other."
