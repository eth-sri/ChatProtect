  "explanation": "The statements about Nancy Meyers, the screenwriter for The Intern, are not contradictory. Both statements highlight her reputation for creating strong female characters and exploring themes of relationships and gender roles in her films. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions her roles as a producer and director, while statement 2 focuses solely on her work as a screenwriter. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Nancy Meyers as a talented writer who has made significant contributions to the romantic comedy genre."
