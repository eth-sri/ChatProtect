  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Rush?\" are not contradictory. While the first statement acknowledges that Rush's music has spanned multiple genres throughout their career, the second statement simply identifies them as a rock band. The second statement does not deny the fact that Rush's music has incorporated elements of other genres, but rather provides a broad categorization of their overall sound. Therefore, both statements can coexist without contradiction."
