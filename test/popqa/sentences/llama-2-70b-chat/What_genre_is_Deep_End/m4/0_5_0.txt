  "prefix": " Deep End is a 1970 British psychological drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is not a genre film in the classical sense, but it has elements of surrealism, drama, and psychological horror. The film follows a Polish immigrant, Mike, who takes a job as a night porter at a London hotel. He becomes increasingly unhinged and paranoid, experiencing strange and surreal visions and hallucinations. The film's narrative is fragmented, and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that adds to the sense of unease and tension.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the film has elements of psychological horror, while the first statement also includes additional descriptions of the film as a surrealist nightmare and a critique of the British class system. These descriptions do not contradict the idea that the film can be classified as a psychological horror."
