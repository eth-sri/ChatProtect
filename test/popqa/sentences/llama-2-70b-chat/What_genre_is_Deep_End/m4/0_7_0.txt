  "alt": "Deep End can be classified as a psychological horror film with surrealist elements.",
  "prefix": " Deep End is a 1970 British psychological drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is not a genre film in the classical sense, but it has elements of surrealism, drama, and psychological horror. The film follows a Polish immigrant, Mike, who takes a job as a night porter at a London hotel. He becomes increasingly unhinged and paranoid, experiencing strange and surreal visions and hallucinations. The film's narrative is fragmented, and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that adds to the sense of unease and tension. Deep End has been described as a surrealist nightmare, a psychological horror film, and a critique of the British class system. It features elements of drama, thriller, and horror, making it a unique and unsettling viewing experience that defies easy categorization.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the film contains elements of multiple genres, including drama and thriller, in addition to psychological horror. Statement 2 specifically highlights the surrealist elements of the film, which contribute to its overall genre classification as a psychological horror film. Both statements recognize the complexity and unique nature of the film's genre, rather than attempting to categorize it into a single, narrow genre."
