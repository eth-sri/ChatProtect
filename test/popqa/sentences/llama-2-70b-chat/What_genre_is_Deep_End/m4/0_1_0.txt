  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the film has elements of multiple genres, including surrealism, drama, and psychological horror, while statement 2 specifically identifies it as a psychological drama. Therefore, both statements are complementary and provide a more nuanced understanding of the film's genre."
