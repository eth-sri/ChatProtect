  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the dreamlike and fragmented nature of the film's narrative, which blurs the lines between reality and fantasy. They both emphasize the surreal and psychological elements of the film, which contribute to its overall sense of unease and tension. While the first statement mentions the film's atmosphere, the second statement focuses more on the narrative itself, but they both convey a similar idea about the film's genre."
