  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the film has elements of different genres, including surrealism, drama, and psychological horror, but does not classify it as a genre film in the classical sense. Statement 2 simply clarifies that the film is not a horror film, which is consistent with the first statement's mention of psychological horror as just one of the elements present in the film."
