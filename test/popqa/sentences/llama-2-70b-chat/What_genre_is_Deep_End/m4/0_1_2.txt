  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the film does not fit neatly into a single genre, but rather incorporates elements of several genres, including surrealism, drama, and psychological horror. Statement 2 further elaborates on the surreal and dreamlike atmosphere of the film, which supports the idea that it is not easily categorized into a single genre. Overall, both statements suggest that Deep End is a complex and multi-layered film that defies easy classification."
