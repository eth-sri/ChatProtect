  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Deep End are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the film's use of surrealism and blurring of reality and fantasy to create a sense of unease and tension. The first statement specifically mentions the fragmented narrative, while the second statement emphasizes the use of psychological horror elements. However, both statements ultimately support the idea that Deep End is not a traditional genre film and instead incorporates various elements to create a unique viewing experience."
