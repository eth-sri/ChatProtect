  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Need are not contradictory, but they do differ slightly in their emphasis. Both statements agree that Carrie Jones is the author of Need and that she is known for writing young adult fiction in the fantasy genre. However, statement 1 also includes middle grade fiction and science fiction as genres she writes in, while statement 2 emphasizes the paranormal romance genre. These differences do not contradict each other, but rather provide slightly different perspectives on the author's writing career."
