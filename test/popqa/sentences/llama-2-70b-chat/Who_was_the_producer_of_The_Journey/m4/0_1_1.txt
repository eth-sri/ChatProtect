  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of The Journey? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies Thatgamecompany as the producer of The Journey, while also providing additional information about the company's background and founders. \n\nHowever, Statement 2 is incorrect in stating that the video game was developed by Jennifer Hale. Jennifer Hale is a voice actress who has worked on many video games, but she was not involved in the development of The Journey."
