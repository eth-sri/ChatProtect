  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the capital of Wiltshire are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Trowbridge is the capital of Wiltshire, while Statement 2 claims that Salisbury is the capital of Wiltshire. Since they are two different cities, they cannot both be the capital of the same county. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
