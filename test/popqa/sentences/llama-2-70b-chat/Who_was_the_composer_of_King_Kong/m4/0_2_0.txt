Both statements provide additional information about Max Steiner's career as a film composer, including the fact that he composed music for over 300 films and worked on other classic movies such as \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"Casablanca.\" The only difference is that statement 1 mentions \"The Wizard of Oz\" while statement 2 focuses on the iconic themes he composed for \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"Casablanca.\" However, both statements support the fact that Max Steiner was a prolific and influential film composer of the 20th century, and that he was the composer of the music for \"King Kong.\""
