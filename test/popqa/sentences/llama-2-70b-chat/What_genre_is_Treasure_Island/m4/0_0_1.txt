  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Treasure Island are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Treasure Island is an adventure novel, but statement 1 adds that it is also classified as historical fiction. This means that the novel is set in a historical time period and includes elements of historical accuracy, such as the portrayal of pirates and their way of life. Therefore, statement 1 provides additional information about the subgenre of Treasure Island, while statement 2 simply identifies it as adventure fiction."
