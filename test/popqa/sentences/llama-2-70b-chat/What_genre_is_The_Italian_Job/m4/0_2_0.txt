  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of The Italian Job are contradictory. Statement 1 describes the film as a crime/action film, while Statement 2 describes it as a crime comedy. While both statements acknowledge the crime element of the film, they differ in their emphasis on other genres. Statement 1 focuses on action and suspense, while Statement 2 emphasizes the comedic elements of the film. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
