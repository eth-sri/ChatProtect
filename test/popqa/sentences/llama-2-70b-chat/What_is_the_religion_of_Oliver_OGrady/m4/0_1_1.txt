  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Oliver O'Grady are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that information about an individual's religious beliefs or affiliations is considered private and personal, and it would not be appropriate to disclose it without their consent. The first statement adds that it is not possible for the speaker to provide such information, while the second statement simply reiterates the privacy aspect. Overall, both statements convey the same message and are consistent with each other."
