  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Edith van Dyne was a pen name used by L. Frank Baum, while Statement 2 directly states that Edith van Dyne is a pen name used by L. Frank Baum. The difference lies in the use of the past tense in Statement 1 (\"was a pen name used\") versus the present tense in Statement 2 (\"is a pen name used\"). Therefore, it is unclear which statement is accurate without further research."
