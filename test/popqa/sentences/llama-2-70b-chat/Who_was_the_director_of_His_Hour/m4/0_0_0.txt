  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. Both statements say that the director of His Hour is not specified, but they imply different things. The first statement suggests that there is no information available about the director, while the second statement implies that the information may exist but has not been provided. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
