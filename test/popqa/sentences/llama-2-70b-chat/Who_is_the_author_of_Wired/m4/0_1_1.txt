  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Wired? are contradictory. The first statement states that Wired was founded by Chris Anderson, Louis Rossetto, and Jane Metcalfe and originally published by Wired Ventures, a company founded by Anderson and Rossetto. However, the second statement contradicts this by stating that the magazine was originally published by Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications. Therefore, it is unclear who the true author of Wired is based on these conflicting statements."
