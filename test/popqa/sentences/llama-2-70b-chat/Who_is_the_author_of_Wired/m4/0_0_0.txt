  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Wired? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that Wired was founded by three individuals, including Chris Anderson, but does not specify who the author of the magazine is. \n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, directly states that Chris Anderson is the author of Wired, which contradicts the idea that the magazine was founded by a group of people. \n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
