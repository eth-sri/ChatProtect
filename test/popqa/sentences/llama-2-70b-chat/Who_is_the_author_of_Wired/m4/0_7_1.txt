  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Wired? are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the current status of Wired magazine and its publisher, Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications. While the first statement emphasizes the continued relevance and importance of Wired as a source of technology news and analysis, the second statement simply reiterates that the magazine is still published by Cond\u00e9 Nast. Neither statement contradicts the fact that Wired was founded by Chris Anderson, Louis Rossetto, and Jane Metcalfe, and that Anderson and Rossetto played key roles in shaping the magazine's editorial direction."
