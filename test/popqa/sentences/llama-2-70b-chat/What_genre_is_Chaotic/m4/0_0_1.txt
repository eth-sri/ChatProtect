However, I can provide an objective analysis of the statements. \n\nThe two statements do not provide any information about the genre of Chaotic. The first statement only mentions that it is a television series that aired on Cartoon Network from 2005 to 2008, while the second statement mentions that it aired on the critical network. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but they do not answer the prompt about the genre of Chaotic."
