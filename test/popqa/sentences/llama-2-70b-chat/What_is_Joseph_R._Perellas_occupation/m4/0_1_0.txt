  "explanation": "The statements about Joseph R. Perella's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements describe him as an investment banker who provides strategic financial advice to corporations and other entities. The first statement provides additional information about his specific role as the founder and chairman of a global investment banking firm, while the second statement is a more general description of his occupation. However, both statements are consistent in portraying Perella as an investment banker who offers strategic financial advice."
