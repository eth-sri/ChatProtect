  "explanation": "The statements about Joseph R. Perella's occupation are not contradictory. While the text primarily focuses on his role as a businessman and investment banker, both statements acknowledge his involvement in philanthropic efforts. Statement 1 specifically mentions the Perella Family Foundation, which suggests a more formal and organized approach to philanthropy, while Statement 2 highlights his involvement in education and healthcare, which could be more informal or personal. However, both statements are consistent with the idea that Perella is not solely defined by his occupation as an investment banker, but also has a broader range of interests and activities."
