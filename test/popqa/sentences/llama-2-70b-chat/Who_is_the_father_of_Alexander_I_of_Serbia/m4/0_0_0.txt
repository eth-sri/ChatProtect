  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the father of Alexander I of Serbia? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the father of Alexander I of Serbia was Prince Mihailo Obrenovic, while Statement 2 claims that the father was King Milan Obrenovic. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other. It is important to note that only one of these statements can be correct, and further research is needed to determine which one is accurate."
