  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Light Years? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Light Years as a pop-punk band belonging to the subgenre of emo, which suggests a heavier, guitar-driven sound with emotionally charged lyrics. \n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 describes Light Years as a pop album, which suggests a more mainstream, radio-friendly sound with catchy hooks and upbeat melodies. \n\nThese two descriptions of Light Years' genre are quite different and cannot both be true at the same time."
