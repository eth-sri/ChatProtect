  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Deathstalker II are not contradictory. The first statement provides the answer to the prompt, stating that Roger Corman was the producer of the film. The second statement provides additional information, stating that Corman was also the director of the film. While it is not common for a producer to also direct a film, it is not contradictory for one person to hold both roles."
