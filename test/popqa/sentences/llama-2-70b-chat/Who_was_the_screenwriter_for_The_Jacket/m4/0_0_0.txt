  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Jacket are contradictory because they provide different names for the same role. One statement says it was Massy Tadjedin, while the other says it was Scott Frank. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is accurate and further research would be needed to determine the correct answer."
