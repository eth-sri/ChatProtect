  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. The first statement claims that the producer of the album \"Construct\" is unknown and there is no information available on the producer. However, the second statement claims that the music project \"The Construct\" was created by the band's lead vocalist and guitarist, Mike Kinsella. If Kinsella created the project, it is likely that he also had a hand in producing the album. Therefore, the second statement contradicts the first statement by providing a potential answer to the question of who produced the album."
