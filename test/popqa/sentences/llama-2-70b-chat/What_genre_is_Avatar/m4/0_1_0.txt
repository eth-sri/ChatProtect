  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Avatar are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Avatar is primarily a science fiction film, but also includes elements of other genres such as action, adventure, and fantasy. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions epic fantasy as a subgenre, while statement 1 does not. However, this does not contradict the overall classification of Avatar as a science fiction film."
