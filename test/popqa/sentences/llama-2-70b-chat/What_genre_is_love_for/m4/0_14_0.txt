  "explanation": "The statements about the genres of love are not contradictory. Both statements mention drama as a genre that can explore the theme of love, but they focus on different aspects. Statement 1 mentions love as a central theme in dramatic works, while Statement 2 emphasizes the complexities and conflicts of romantic relationships that can be explored in drama. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
