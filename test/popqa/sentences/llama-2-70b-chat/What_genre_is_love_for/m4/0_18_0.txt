  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is love for? are not contradictory. Both statements mention that philosophical works on love can be found in the writings of ancient Greeks, such as Plato and Aristotle, as well as in contemporary philosophy. The only difference is that statement 2 adds Sartre to the list of philosophers who have written about love. However, this does not contradict statement 1, as it does not exclude the possibility of other philosophers besides Sartre writing about love in contemporary times."
