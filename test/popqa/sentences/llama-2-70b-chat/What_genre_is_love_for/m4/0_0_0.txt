The first statement acknowledges that love can be classified into different genres based on the context and perspective, implying that love can be viewed through different lenses and interpreted in various ways. The second statement simply states that love can be classified as an emotion, which is a widely accepted classification. Therefore, both statements can coexist without contradiction."
