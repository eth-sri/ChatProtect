  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is love for?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 implies that there are multiple genres associated with love, but does not provide any specific examples. Statement 2 expands on this idea by providing some common genres associated with love, which are consistent with the idea presented in Statement 1. Therefore, both statements support the idea that love can be classified into various genres."
