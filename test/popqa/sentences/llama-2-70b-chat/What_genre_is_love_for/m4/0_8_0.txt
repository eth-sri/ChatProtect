  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of love are not contradictory. While the text mentions romance and eroticism as common genres associated with love, statement 1 and statement 2 suggest that poetry is another genre that can be used to express love and affection in various forms. Poetry can be both romantic and erotic, but it can also delve deeper into the complexities of love beyond just the emotional and sexual aspects. Therefore, the statements complement the text by adding another perspective on the genre of love."
