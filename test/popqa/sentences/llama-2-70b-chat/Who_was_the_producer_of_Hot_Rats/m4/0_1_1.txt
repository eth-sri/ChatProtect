  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Hot Rats? are not contradictory. The first statement simply states that Frank Zappa produced the album himself, while the second statement provides additional information about the album's musical style and critical reception. The fact that Zappa used a pseudonym during the production process does not contradict the first statement, as it is still true that he was the producer of the album."
