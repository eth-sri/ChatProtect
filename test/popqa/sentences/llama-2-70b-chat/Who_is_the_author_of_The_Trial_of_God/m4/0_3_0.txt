Both statements provide additional information about the play and its content, specifically the form it takes and the central question it explores. While the first statement focuses on God's role in the suffering of the Jewish people, the second statement highlights God's silence during the Holocaust. Both statements are consistent with the overall theme of the play and do not contradict each other."
