  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Kanjiroba Himal?\" are contradictory. The first statement claims that Kanjiroba Himal is not a real mountain, while the second statement states that it was created by Michael Crichton for his novel \"Seven Years in Tibet.\" If Kanjiroba Himal is a fictional mountain created by an author, it cannot be a real mountain located in a specific country. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
