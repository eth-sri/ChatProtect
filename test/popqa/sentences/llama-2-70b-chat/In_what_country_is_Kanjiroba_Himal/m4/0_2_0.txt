While the first statement explains that Kanjiroba Himal is a fictional mountain and therefore not located in any specific country or region, the second statement provides information about the origin of the name \"Kanjiroba Himal.\" It explains that the name is derived from either the Japanese and Nepali languages or the fictional language of the story. Both statements are providing different information and do not contradict each other."
