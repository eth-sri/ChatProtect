  "explanation": "The statements about what genre Andr\u00e9 Watts belongs to are not contradictory. While he is primarily known as a classical pianist, statement 1 indicates that he has also performed and recorded works by contemporary composers, which could potentially expand his genre classification to include contemporary classical music. Statement 2 simply highlights one of his notable recordings within the classical genre. Therefore, both statements are consistent with Andr\u00e9 Watts being primarily classified as a classical pianist."
