While the first statement specifies that he is a classical pianist, the second statement provides additional information about his style and reputation within that genre. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Andr\u00e9 Watts is a classical pianist known for his technical skill and emotive performances of a wide range of classical music repertoire."
