  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of James I of Aragon are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that he was a Catholic and supported the Catholic Church and the Pope during his reign. Statement 1 provides additional information about his personal beliefs and devotion to Christianity, while statement 2 emphasizes his political and institutional support for the Catholic Church. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of James I's religious affiliation and his relationship with the Catholic Church."
