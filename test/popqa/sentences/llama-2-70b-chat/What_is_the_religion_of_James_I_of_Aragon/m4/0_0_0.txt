  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of James I of Aragon are not contradictory. However, it seems that there is a mistake in the text as both statements are identical. It is important to note that James I of Aragon was indeed a Catholic, as he was a member of the House of Barcelona, which was known for its strong Catholic faith."
