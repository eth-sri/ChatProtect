  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Mouse? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author of \"Mouse\" is Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), while Statement 2 claims that the author of \"Mouse\" is Rudyard Kipling. These are two different authors, and therefore the statements cannot both be true."
