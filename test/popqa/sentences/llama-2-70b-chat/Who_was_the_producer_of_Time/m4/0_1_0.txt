  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of \"Time\" are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information. Statement 1 explains that while Lindsey Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood were the main producers of the album, the other members of Fleetwood Mac also made production contributions. Statement 2 adds that Ken Caillat was also involved in the production process. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the production of \"Time\" rather than contradicting each other."
