  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for Star Trek: First Contact are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Brannon Braga's career and his involvement in the Star Trek franchise, but they do not contradict each other. Statement 1 highlights Braga's work as a television producer, director, and screenwriter, while statement 2 specifically mentions his work on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and \"Star Trek: Voyager.\" Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of Braga's career and his contributions to the Star Trek universe."
