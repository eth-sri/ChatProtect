  "explanation": "The statements about the themes explored in \"The Night Watch\" do not contradict the statement about the author. While the first statement focuses on sexuality, identity, and women's experiences during wartime, the second statement emphasizes love, loss, and identity against the backdrop of war and social change. Both statements are valid interpretations of the themes present in the novel and do not contradict the fact that Sarah Waters is the author."
