  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Breaking Bad are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Vince Gilligan was the creator and showrunner of the series and directed several episodes, including the pilot and finale. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions Bryan Cranston and Michelle MacLaren as additional directors who worked on the show, while statement 2 adds Peter Gould to the list. However, both statements agree that there were other directors involved in the production of Breaking Bad besides Vince Gilligan."
