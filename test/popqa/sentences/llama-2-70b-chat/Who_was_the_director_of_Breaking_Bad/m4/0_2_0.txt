  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Breaking Bad? are not contradictory. While Vince Gilligan was the main director and showrunner of the series, other actors and directors also directed several episodes of the show, including Bryan Cranston and Michelle MacLaren. Dean Norris also directed an episode of the show. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about other directors who worked on Breaking Bad, but do not contradict the fact that Vince Gilligan was the main director and showrunner."
