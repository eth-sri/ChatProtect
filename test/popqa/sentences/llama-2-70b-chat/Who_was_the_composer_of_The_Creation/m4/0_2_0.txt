  "explanation": "The statements about the libretto of The Creation are contradictory, but they do not contradict the statement about the composer. The first statement correctly identifies Johann Peter Salomon as the writer of the libretto, while the second statement incorrectly identifies Gottfried van Swieten as the writer. However, neither statement disputes the fact that Joseph Haydn was the composer of The Creation."
