  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of The Creation? are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the oratorio, specifically about its structure and content. The first statement emphasizes that the oratorio is divided into three parts, while the second statement emphasizes that each part represents a different stage in the creation story. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Joseph Haydn was the composer of The Creation."
