  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Clouds? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the play, including its genre, when it was written, and where it was first performed. Statement 2 simply restates that The Clouds is a play, which is already implied in the prompt. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Aristophanes is the author of The Clouds."
