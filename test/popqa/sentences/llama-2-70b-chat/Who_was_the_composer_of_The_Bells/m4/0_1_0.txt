  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of The Bells? are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Sergei Rachmaninoff as the composer of The Bells, but also specifies that it is a choral symphony. The second statement contradicts this by stating that The Bells is a symphonic poem, which is a different type of musical composition."
