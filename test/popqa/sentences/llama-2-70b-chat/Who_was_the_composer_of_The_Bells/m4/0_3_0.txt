  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of The Bells are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the composition uses six bell sound effects to represent the different sounds of Moscow's bells, while Statement 2 does not mention any bell sound effects. Additionally, Statement 1 mentions that the composition is scored for a mixed chorus and orchestra, while Statement 2 specifies a large orchestra. These differences suggest that the statements are not consistent with each other."
