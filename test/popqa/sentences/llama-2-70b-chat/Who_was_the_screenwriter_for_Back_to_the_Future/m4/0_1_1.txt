  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Back to the Future are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the fact that both Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote the screenplay for the film, while Statement 2 simply states the year in which the screenplay was released. Both statements are consistent with the initial text, which identifies Zemeckis and Gale as the screenwriters for Back to the Future."
