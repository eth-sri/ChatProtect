  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of James I of Scotland are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Margaret Tudor as the mother of James I of Scotland and also provides additional information about her being the wife of King James IV of Scotland and the daughter of King Henry VII of England. However, statement 2 incorrectly suggests that Margaret Tudor was only the daughter of Henry VII of England and omits her role as the mother of James I of Scotland. Therefore, the two statements present conflicting information about Margaret Tudor's identity and relationship to James I of Scotland."
