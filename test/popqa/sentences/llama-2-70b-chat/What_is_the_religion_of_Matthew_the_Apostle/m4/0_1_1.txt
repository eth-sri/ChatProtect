  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there is no explicit mention of Matthew's religion in historical sources, while the second statement provides information about his conversion to Christianity and becoming one of Jesus' apostles. The first statement does not negate the second statement, as it is possible for someone to convert from one religion to another. Therefore, the two statements complement each other in providing a fuller understanding of Matthew's religious background and beliefs."
