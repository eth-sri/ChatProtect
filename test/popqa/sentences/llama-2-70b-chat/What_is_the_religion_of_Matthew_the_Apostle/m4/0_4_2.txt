  "alt": "Had accepted Jesus as the Messiah.",
  "prefix": " The religion of Matthew the Apostle is not explicitly stated in the New Testament or other historical sources. However, it is generally believed that Matthew, also known as Levi, was a Jewish tax collector before he became a follower of Jesus Christ. Matthew's Gospel, which he is traditionally believed to have written, does contain references to Jewish customs, laws, and traditions, suggesting that he was familiar with Jewish practices and beliefs. Additionally, Matthew's Gospel emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, which suggests that Matthew had a Jewish background and was writing to a Jewish audience.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that Matthew was a Jew who had accepted Jesus as the Messiah and followed his teachings. The first statement provides more detail about Matthew's likely religious background, while the second statement simply states that he had accepted Jesus as the Messiah. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Matthew was a Jewish Christian."
