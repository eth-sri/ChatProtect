  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that Matthew's religion is not explicitly stated, but suggests that he was likely Jewish based on his occupation as a tax collector and his familiarity with Jewish customs and traditions as evidenced in his Gospel. The second statement further supports the idea that Matthew was Jewish by identifying him as a member of the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that Matthew was a Jewish follower of Jesus Christ."
