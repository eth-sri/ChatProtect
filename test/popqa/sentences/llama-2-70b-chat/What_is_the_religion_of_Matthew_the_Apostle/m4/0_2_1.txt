Both statements acknowledge that Matthew had a Jewish background and was familiar with Jewish customs and beliefs, which is consistent with the fact that he was a Jewish tax collector before becoming a follower of Jesus. The first statement simply states that Matthew's religion is not explicitly stated in historical sources, while the second statement notes that his Gospel contains hints of his Jewish background and beliefs."
