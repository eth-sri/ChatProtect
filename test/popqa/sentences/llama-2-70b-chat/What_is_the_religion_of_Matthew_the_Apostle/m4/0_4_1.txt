  "alt": "He was a member of the tribe of Levi.",
  "prefix": " The religion of Matthew the Apostle is not explicitly stated in the New Testament or other historical sources. However, it is generally believed that Matthew, also known as Levi, was a Jewish tax collector before he became a follower of Jesus Christ. Matthew's Gospel, which he is traditionally believed to have written, does contain references to Jewish customs, laws, and traditions, suggesting that he was familiar with Jewish practices and beliefs. Additionally, Matthew's Gospel emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, which suggests that Matthew had a Jewish background and was writing to a Jewish audience.",

Statement 1 suggests that Matthew was a Jewish Christian, meaning he followed both Jewish customs and beliefs as well as the teachings of Jesus Christ. Statement 2 provides additional information about Matthew's Jewish background by stating that he was a member of the tribe of Levi. Both statements support the idea that Matthew had a Jewish background and likely followed a form of Jewish Christianity."
