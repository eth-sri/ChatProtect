  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same idea that there is no clear information available about the religion of Matthew the Apostle in any historical sources, including the New Testament and the Bible. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"reliable\" in the second statement, which emphasizes the need for credible sources to determine the religion of Matthew the Apostle."
