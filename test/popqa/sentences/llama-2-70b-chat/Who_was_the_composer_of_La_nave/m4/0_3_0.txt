They both provide additional information about the composer Riccardo Zandonai and his other notable operas, but they do not contradict each other. Statement 1 mentions \"Conchita\" and \"Melenis,\" while Statement 2 mentions \"Francesca da Rimini\" and \"Il granCaruso.\" These are different operas, but they are all works of Riccardo Zandonai."
