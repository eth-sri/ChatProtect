  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Shaft is a prime example of the blaxploitation genre, which was characterized by low-budget, independently produced films aimed at African American audiences. Statement 2 adds that the film also featured a powerful soundtrack by Isaac Hayes. Both statements are consistent with Shaft being a blaxploitation film, as the genre often incorporated elements of funk, soul, and jazz music into the films."
