  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shaft are not contradictory. Both statements identify Shaft as a prime example of the blaxploitation genre, which emerged in the early 1970s and was characterized by low-budget, independently produced films that were aimed at African American audiences and often featured black actors in leading roles. The only difference between the two statements is the wording used to describe the emergence of the blaxploitation genre. Statement 1 specifies that the genre emerged in the early 1970s, while Statement 2 simply states that it emerged during the 1970s. However, this difference in wording does not change the overall message of the statements, which is that Shaft is a blaxploitation film."
