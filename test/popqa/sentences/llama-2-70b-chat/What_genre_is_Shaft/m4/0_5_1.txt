It is considered a prime example of the blaxploitation genre, which emerged in the early 1970s and was characterized by low-budget, independently produced films that were aimed at African American audiences and often featured black actors in leading roles. The film is also considered a classic of the action and crime genres. The blaxploitation genre was defined by its focus on African American characters and themes, as well as its often controversial and politically charged content. The films were often criticized for their graphic violence, sexuality, and negative portrayals of African Americans, but they were also praised for their cultural relevance and for providing opportunities for black actors and filmmakers.",
