  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Suicide?\" are not contradictory. While both statements acknowledge the seriousness of suicide, they approach the topic from different angles. Statement 1 emphasizes that suicide should never be seen as a solution, while Statement 2 highlights the cultural stigma surrounding suicide. Both statements can coexist and contribute to a larger conversation about suicide prevention and awareness."
