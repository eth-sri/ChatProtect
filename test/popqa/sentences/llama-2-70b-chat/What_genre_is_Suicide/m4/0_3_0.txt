The text is emphasizing the seriousness of suicide and the importance of seeking help, while statement 1 is emphasizing that suicide should never be seen as a solution or option. Statement 2 acknowledges that suicide may be a sign of someone in distress and in need of help. Overall, the text and statements are complementary in their message that suicide is a serious issue that requires attention and support."
