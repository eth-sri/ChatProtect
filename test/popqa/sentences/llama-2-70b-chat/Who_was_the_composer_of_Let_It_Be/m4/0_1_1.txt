Both statements acknowledge that while John Lennon is often credited as the primary composer of the song, it is officially credited to Lennon-McCartney, indicating that both Lennon and McCartney contributed to its composition. Statement 1 simply emphasizes this fact, while Statement 2 restates it in a slightly different way."
