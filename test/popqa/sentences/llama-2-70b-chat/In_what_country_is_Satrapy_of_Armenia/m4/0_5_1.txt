  "prefix": " The Satrapy of Armenia was a satrapy (province) of the Achaemenid Empire, which was located in the ancient kingdom of Armenia. The Achaemenid Empire was a Persian empire that existed from the 6th to the 4th century BC. The Satrapy of Armenia was established by the Achaemenid king Darius I (Darius the Great) in the 6th century BC, after he conquered the kingdom of Armenia. The satrapy was governed by a satrap (a governor appointed by the king) who was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining order, and upholding the laws of the empire. The Satrapy of Armenia was located in the eastern part of the Achaemenid Empire, and it covered a large territory that included not only modern-day Armenia but also parts of present-day Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.",

  "explanation": "Statement 1 and Statement 2 are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the city of Erebuni was founded by Darius I, while Statement 2 states that it was founded by King Argishti I of Urartu in 782 BC. This discrepancy suggests that the information in Statement 2 is incorrect or refers to a different city with a similar name. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the country in which the Satrapy of Armenia was located based on these statements alone."
