The Satrapy of Armenia was established by the Achaemenid king Darius I (Darius the Great) in the 6th century BC, after he conquered the kingdom of Armenia. The satrapy was governed by a satrap (a governor appointed by the king) who was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining order, and upholding the laws of the empire. The Satrapy of Armenia was located in the eastern part of the Achaemenid Empire, and it covered a large territory that included not only modern-day Armenia but also parts of present-day Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The capital of the satrapy was the city of Erebuni (also known as Yerevan), which was founded by Darius I and became an important center of trade and culture. The Satrapy of Armenia played a significant role in the Achaemenid Empire's economy, culture, and politics.",
