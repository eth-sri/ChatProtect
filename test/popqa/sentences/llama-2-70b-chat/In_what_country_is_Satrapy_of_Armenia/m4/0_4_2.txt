The Satrapy of Armenia was established by the Achaemenid king Darius I (Darius the Great) in the 6th century BC, after he conquered the kingdom of Armenia. The satrapy was governed by a satrap (a governor appointed by the king) who was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining order, and upholding the laws of the empire.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the location of the Satrapy of Armenia are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the satrapy covered a large territory that included modern-day Armenia and parts of neighboring countries such as Turkey and Georgia. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions Azerbaijan as well, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the information provided in statement 1."
