  "explanation": "The statements about the location of the Satrapy of Armenia are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the Satrapy of Armenia was located in ancient empires - the Achaemenid Empire and the Persian Empire. The Achaemenid Empire was a Persian empire that existed from 550-330 BCE, so it is accurate to say that the Satrapy of Armenia was located in the ancient Persian Empire. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the location of the Satrapy of Armenia."
