  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, as they both provide information about the establishment of the Satrapy of Armenia by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC. Statement 1 specifies that it was established after the conquest of the kingdom of Armenia by Darius I, while Statement 2 simply states that it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. Both statements are consistent with the historical context of the Achaemenid Empire's expansion and control over various territories, including Armenia."
