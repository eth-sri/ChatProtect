  "explanation": "The statements about the location of the Satrapy of Armenia are not contradictory, but rather provide different levels of detail. Statement 1 describes the larger territory that the satrapy covered, including parts of modern-day Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, while Statement 2 provides a more specific location within that territory, the Armenian Highlands, which includes modern-day Armenia and parts of Turkey. Both statements are accurate and complement each other in providing a fuller understanding of the location of the Satrapy of Armenia."
