  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Joseph Cardijn are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that Cardijn was a devout Catholic and a member of the Catholic Church. Statement 1 provides additional information about Cardijn's personal beliefs and how they influenced his social justice work, while Statement 2 simply confirms his affiliation with the Catholic Church. Together, the statements paint a more complete picture of Cardijn's religious identity."
