  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Joseph Cardijn are contradictory. The first statement states that he was ordained as a priest in 1906, while the second statement states that he was ordained a priest in 1925. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different years for his ordination. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
