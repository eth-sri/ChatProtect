  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Joseph Cardijn are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize his strong commitment to the Catholic faith and his belief in its potential to bring about social justice and change. The only difference is in the wording, with the first statement emphasizing his personal connection to the faith and the second statement emphasizing the role of the Catholic Church as an institution in promoting social change. Overall, both statements support the idea that Cardijn was a devout Catholic who saw his faith as integral to his social activism."
