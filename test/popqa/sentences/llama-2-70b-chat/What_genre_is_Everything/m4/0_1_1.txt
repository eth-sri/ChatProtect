  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Everything? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Everything combines elements from multiple genres, including simulation, adventure, and puzzle games. The only difference is that statement 1 includes sandbox as one of the genres, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the overall idea that Everything defies traditional genre classification by blending elements from different genres."
