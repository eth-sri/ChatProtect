  "explanation": "The statements about the themes explored in Dolores Claiborne are not contradictory to the statement about the author. While the first statement focuses on the relationships between women, abuse, and trauma, the second statement emphasizes the complexities of human relationships, family dynamics, and psychological trauma. Both statements are valid interpretations of the themes present in the novel and do not contradict the fact that Stephen King is the author of Dolores Claiborne."
