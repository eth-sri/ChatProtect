  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Dolores Claiborne are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the novel was adapted into a film starring Kathy Bates and Jennifer Jason Leigh, while Statement 2 says that it was adapted into a film directed by Taylor Hackford and starring Jennifer Lopez. These are two different films with different directors and casts, so they cannot both be true."
