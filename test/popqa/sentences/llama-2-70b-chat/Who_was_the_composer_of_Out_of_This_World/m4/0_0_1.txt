  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Out of This World? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 clearly states that the music was written by Cy Coleman, while Statement 2 claims that the music was written by Claude Debussy. Since the two statements provide different answers to the same question, they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they are contradictory."
