Both statements provide additional information about Cy Coleman's notable works, including \"Sweet Charity\" and \"Seesaw\". The only difference is that statement 1 also includes \"Barnum\" as one of his notable works, while statement 2 includes the hit song \"Witchcraft\" for Frank Sinatra. However, both statements agree that Cy Coleman was a prolific composer and songwriter with many successful works."
