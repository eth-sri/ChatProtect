  "explanation": "The statements about what sport Birmingham City F.C. plays are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that the team plays football, also known as soccer, in the Championship league, which is the second tier of English football. The second statement simply adds that the team is known for playing association football, which is another term for the sport. Therefore, both statements provide consistent information about the sport played by Birmingham City F.C."
