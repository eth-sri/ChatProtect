While the first statement mentions that Mary Washington managed the family's plantation, Mount Vernon, during her husband's absence, the second statement adds that she also managed the family's other plantation, Ferry Farm, during her husband's frequent absences. Both statements highlight Mary Washington's strength and capability in managing the family's affairs, including the upbringing of her children."
