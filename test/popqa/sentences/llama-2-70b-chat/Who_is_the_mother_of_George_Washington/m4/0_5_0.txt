  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of George Washington are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about Mary Ball Washington, specifically about her death. Statement 1 mentions that she died just before her son's inauguration as President, while Statement 2 provides the exact date of her death and her age at the time. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Mary Ball Washington was indeed the mother of George Washington."
