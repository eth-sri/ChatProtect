  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of George Washington are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Mary Ball Washington was the mother of George Washington and that she had nine children with Augustine Washington, including George. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about George's birth year, while statement 2 simply restates that he was one of their nine children."
