  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of George Washington? are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Mary Ball Washington died in 1789, while Statement 2 states that she was inaugurated as the First Lady of the United States in the same year. Since the role of First Lady is reserved for the wife of the President, it is impossible for Mary Ball Washington to have held this position after her death. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
