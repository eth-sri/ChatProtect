Statement 1 provides additional information about Sandy Welch's career as a screenwriter, stating that she has adapted works by other classic authors for television. Statement 2 further supports this by mentioning two other classic novels she has adapted for TV productions. Both statements are consistent with the initial text, which identifies Sandy Welch as the screenwriter for \"North & South\" and notes her reputation for adapting classic novels for television."
