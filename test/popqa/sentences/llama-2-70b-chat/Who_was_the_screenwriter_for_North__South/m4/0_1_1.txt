  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for North & South are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Sandy Welch, the screenwriter for the miniseries. The first statement describes her as a British screenwriter and playwright who specializes in adapting classic novels for television, while the second statement gives examples of other classic literature adaptations she has worked on, including Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Both statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Sandy Welch's work as a screenwriter."
