The first statement clarifies that the author is not explicitly stated, but is attributed to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. The second statement provides additional information about the nature of the book, stating that it is a collection of texts and writings revealed by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and that it is not a work of fiction. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about the authorship and content of The City."
