  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The City are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the author is not explicitly stated, while the second statement highlights the book's significance as a classic of modernist literature. The third statement provides additional information about the book's authorship within the context of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other but rather provide different perspectives on the authorship and significance of The City."
