  "explanation": "The two statements about the authorship of The City are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that while the book is attributed to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, it is actually a collection of texts and writings from various authors. The second statement reinforces the importance of the book in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, regardless of its collective authorship. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the authorship and significance of The City."
