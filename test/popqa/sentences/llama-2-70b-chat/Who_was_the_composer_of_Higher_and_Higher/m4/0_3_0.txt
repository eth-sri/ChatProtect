The text is referring to \"Higher and Higher\" written by Leonard Chess, Phil Chess, and Carl Davis, while statement 1 is referring to a different song also titled \"Higher and Higher\" that was recorded by the Righteous Brothers in 1966. Therefore, the composer of the song in statement 1 is not mentioned in the text. Statement 2 is irrelevant as it does not provide any information about the composer of either song."
