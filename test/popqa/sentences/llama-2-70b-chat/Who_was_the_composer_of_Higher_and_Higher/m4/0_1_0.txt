  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Higher and Higher? are contradictory. The first statement claims that the song was written by Leonard Chess, Phil Chess, and Carl Davis, while the second statement claims that the song was written by a team of songwriters including Chip Taylor and Billy Davis. These two statements cannot both be true, as they present different information about the song's composers."
