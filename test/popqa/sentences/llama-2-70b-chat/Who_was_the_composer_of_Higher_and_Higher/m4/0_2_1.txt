  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Higher and Higher\" are contradictory. Statement 1 credits the composition and arrangement of the song to the Righteous Brothers, while Statement 2 credits it to The Jacksons. However, the initial text states that the song was written by Leonard Chess, Phil Chess, and Carl Davis, without mentioning either of these two groups as the composers or arrangers. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is accurate, and they cannot both be true."
