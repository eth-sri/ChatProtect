  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Higher and Higher\" are contradictory. The first statement credits the song's composition to Leonard Chess, Phil Chess, and Carl Davis, while the second statement credits it solely to Carl Davis. Additionally, the first statement mentions that the song was written by Leonard Chess and Phil Chess, while the second statement does not mention them at all. Therefore, the two statements present conflicting information about the composer of the song."
