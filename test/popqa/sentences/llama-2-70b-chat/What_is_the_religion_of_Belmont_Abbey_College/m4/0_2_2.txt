  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Belmont Abbey College are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the college's commitment to providing a liberal arts education grounded in the Catholic intellectual tradition and fostering a community of learning and faith. Statement 1 expands on this by explicitly stating the college's mission, while Statement 2 summarizes the same mission in a more concise manner. Overall, both statements support the idea that Belmont Abbey College is a Catholic institution that prioritizes the integration of faith and learning."
