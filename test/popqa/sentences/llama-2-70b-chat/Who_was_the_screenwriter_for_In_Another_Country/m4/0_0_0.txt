  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for In Another Country? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies Hong Sang-soo as the screenwriter for the film \"In Another Country.\" However, statement 2 is incorrect in stating that Han Ji-min was the screenwriter. Han Ji-min is actually an actress who starred in the film, but she did not write the screenplay. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other."
