  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Apollo are not contradictory. Both statements are true and provide additional information about Zeus, who is indeed the father of Apollo and many other gods and demigods in Greek mythology. The first statement elaborates on this fact by mentioning Zeus's role as a prolific father, while the second statement simply reiterates his position as the king of the gods."
