  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Apollo are not contradictory. While the first statement mentions Apollo's mother and her relationship with Zeus, it ultimately confirms that Zeus is indeed the father of Apollo. The second statement simply reiterates that Leto is Apollo's mother. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Zeus is the father of Apollo."
