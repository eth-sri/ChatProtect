  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Apollo are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Zeus, who is identified as the father of Apollo in the text. Statement 1 expands on Zeus's role as a father figure in Greek mythology, while Statement 2 reiterates his position as the king of the gods. Both statements support the initial claim that Zeus is the father of Apollo."
