  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Iron Man are not contradictory. While the first statement identifies the film as belonging to the action and adventure genres, the second statement adds that it is also a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides additional information about the film's context and franchise. Similarly, the third statement identifies Iron Man as a science fiction film, which is not contradictory to the first statement, but rather adds another layer to the film's genre classification. Therefore, all three statements work together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genre of Iron Man."
