Both statements provide additional information about the book and its significance in English literature, but they do not contradict the fact that Sir William Temple is the author of The Temple. Statement 1 highlights the influence of the book on poetry and essay writing during the 17th and 18th centuries, while Statement 2 simply emphasizes the classic status of the work."
