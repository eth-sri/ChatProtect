  "explanation": "The statements about the author of The Temple are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Sir William Temple is the author of The Temple and it was first published in 1662, while statement 2 claims that Sir William Temple first published The Temple in 1633. These two statements cannot both be true as they provide different information about the author and the publication date of the book."
