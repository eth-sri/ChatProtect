  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Temple? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Sir William Temple, the author of The Temple, by describing him as an English statesman and essayist. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one uses the word \"prominent\" to emphasize Temple's importance or prominence in his field. However, this does not contradict the first statement in any way."
