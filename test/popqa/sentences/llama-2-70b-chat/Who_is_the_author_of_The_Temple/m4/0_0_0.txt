  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Temple? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Sir William Temple as the author of The Temple, while statement 2 incorrectly attributes the authorship to Sir Walter Scott. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
