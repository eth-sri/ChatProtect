  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Temple? are not contradictory. Both statements refer to the same essay, \"Upon the Gardens of Epicurus,\" which is included in The Temple. The first statement describes it as an essay, while the second statement describes it as a poem, but this difference in terminology does not contradict the fact that it is included in The Temple and explores the relationship between beauty and utility in art and nature."
