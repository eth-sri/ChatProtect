  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Weekend? are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Trey Edward Shults as the director of the 2016 film The Weekend. Statement 2, on the other hand, refers to a singer named The Weekend, which is unrelated to the director of the film. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
