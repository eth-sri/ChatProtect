  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of The Cruise? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the person is not aware of the movie \"The Cruise\" and therefore cannot provide any information about its producer. \n\nHowever, Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that the producer of \"The Cruise\" was Ben Stiller. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
