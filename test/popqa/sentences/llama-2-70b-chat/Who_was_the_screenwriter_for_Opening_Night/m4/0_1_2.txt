The first statement provides the answer to the prompt, stating that John Cassavetes was the screenwriter for the film. The second statement adds additional information, stating that Gena Rowlands, who was Cassavetes' wife and frequent collaborator, also had a role in the film. The two statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about the film and its creators."
