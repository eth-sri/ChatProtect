  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the text correctly states that Washington, D.C. is a city and not a book, the two statements provide additional information about the design and planning of the city. Specifically, they identify Pierre Charles L'Enfant as the individual who was commissioned by George Washington to design the layout and architecture of the city. Therefore, the statements do not contradict the initial statement that Washington, D.C. does not have an author."
