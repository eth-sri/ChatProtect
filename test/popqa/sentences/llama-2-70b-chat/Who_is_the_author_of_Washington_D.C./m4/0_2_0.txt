  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Washington, D.C.? are not contradictory. While the city itself does not have an author, the first statement provides information about the person who designed the layout of the city, Pierre Charles L'Enfant. The second statement expands on L'Enfant's plan by providing specific details about the grid system of streets and avenues, as well as the central public space known as the National Mall. Both statements are consistent with the fact that L'Enfant was the designer of the city's layout."
