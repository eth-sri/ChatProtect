  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Blues? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that John Landis was the director of The Blues Brothers. The only difference is the phrasing of the sentence. Statement 1 provides additional information about the movie, such as the year and genre, while Statement 2 is a more concise version of the same information."
