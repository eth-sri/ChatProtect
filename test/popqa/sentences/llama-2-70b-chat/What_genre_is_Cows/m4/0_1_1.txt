  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Cows are not contradictory. The first statement describes the film's classification as science fiction or experimental due to its surreal and abstract elements, while the second statement describes a specific scene in the film where a herd of cows dance to a techno soundtrack. The second statement does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides a unique detail about the film's content within its genre."
