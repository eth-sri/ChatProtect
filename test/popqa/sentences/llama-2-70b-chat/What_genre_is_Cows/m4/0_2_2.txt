  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Cows? are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the film does not fit neatly into a specific genre, but rather incorporates elements of various genres. Statement 2 provides additional information about the film's distinctive soundtrack, which is not necessarily related to its genre classification. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
