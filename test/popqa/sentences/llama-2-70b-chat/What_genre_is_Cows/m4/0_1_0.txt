  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Cows are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the film is often classified as both science fiction and experimental due to its surreal and abstract elements, while Statement 2 only classifies it as science fiction. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
