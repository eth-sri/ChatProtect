  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of La Haine are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Mathieu Kassovitz was the director of the film. Statement 1 provides additional information about the film's production, including the fact that Kassovitz co-wrote the screenplay with two other individuals. Statement 2 is a more straightforward statement that simply confirms Kassovitz's role as the director."
