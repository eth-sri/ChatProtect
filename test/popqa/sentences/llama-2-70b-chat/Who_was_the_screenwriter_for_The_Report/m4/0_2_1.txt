  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Report are contradictory. The first statement states that Scott Z. Burns is the screenwriter for The Report and mentions some of his collaborations with Steven Soderbergh. The second statement, however, incorrectly attributes the directing credits of Traffic, Ocean's Eleven, and Magic Mike to Burns, when in fact they were directed by Soderbergh. Therefore, the second statement contradicts the first statement and is inaccurate."
