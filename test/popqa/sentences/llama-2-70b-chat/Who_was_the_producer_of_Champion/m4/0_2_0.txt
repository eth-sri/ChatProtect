  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Champion? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 credits Carl Laemmle Jr. as the producer of the film, while Statement 2 credits Universal-International Pictures as the producer. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. \n\nHowever, it is possible that Carl Laemmle Jr. was the producer for Universal-International Pictures, which would make both statements partially true. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact role of Carl Laemmle Jr. in the production of \"Champion\"."
