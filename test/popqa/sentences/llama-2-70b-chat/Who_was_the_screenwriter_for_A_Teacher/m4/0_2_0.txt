  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for A Teacher are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Hannah Fidell was involved in the production of the film as an executive producer, but it does not confirm whether she was the screenwriter. On the other hand, statement 2 explicitly states that Fidell served as the screenwriter and director for A Teacher. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
