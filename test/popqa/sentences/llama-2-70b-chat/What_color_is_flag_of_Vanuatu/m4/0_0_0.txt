  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the color of the flag of Vanuatu are contradictory. The first statement correctly describes the colors of the flag as black, yellow, and green, while the second statement incorrectly states that the flag is blue. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
