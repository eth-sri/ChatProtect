  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Oklahoma!? are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Richard Rodgers as the composer of the show's music, while the second statement provides additional information about the show's first performance on Broadway in 1943. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the composer and the show's history."
