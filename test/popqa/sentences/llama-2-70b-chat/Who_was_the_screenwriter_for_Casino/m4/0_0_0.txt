  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Casino? are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi as the screenwriters for the movie \"Casino\", while Statement 2 only mentions Martin Scorsese. Therefore, Statement 2 is a subset of Statement 1, and both statements are true."
