Statement 1 correctly states that Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay, while statement 2 incorrectly states that Scorsese and Pileggi were both the director and screenwriter of the film. In fact, Scorsese directed the film, but Pileggi only co-wrote the screenplay with him."
