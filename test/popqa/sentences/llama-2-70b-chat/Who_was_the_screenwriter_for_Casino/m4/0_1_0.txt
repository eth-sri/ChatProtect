  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Casino? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Nicholas Pileggi wrote the book \"Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas,\" which served as the basis for the movie. The only difference is in the subtitle of the book, with statement 1 using \"Love and Blood\" and statement 2 using \"Love and Honor.\" However, this does not affect the fact that Pileggi was the author of the book and therefore played a significant role in the creation of the movie's screenplay."
