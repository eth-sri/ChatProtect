  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"You Never Know\" are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Vincent Youmans as the composer of the song, but places it in the context of the 1926 musical \"Oh, Kay!\" The second statement incorrectly identifies \"Ups-a-Daisy\" as the musical that features the song. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
