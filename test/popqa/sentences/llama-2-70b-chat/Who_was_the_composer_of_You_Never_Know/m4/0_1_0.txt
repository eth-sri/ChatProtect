  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"You Never Know\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify Vincent Youmans as the composer and mention his American nationality. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes his work in musical theatre, while statement 2 mentions his additional roles as a songwriter and pianist. These statements provide complementary information about Youmans' career and do not contradict each other."
