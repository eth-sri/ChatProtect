While the first statement provides information about the controversy surrounding the film More and its portrayal of sexuality and female empowerment, it does not contradict the fact that Barbara Schock and Tammy Tiehel were the directors of the film. The second statement further supports the idea that More is a highly acclaimed film, but does not contradict the information about its directors."
