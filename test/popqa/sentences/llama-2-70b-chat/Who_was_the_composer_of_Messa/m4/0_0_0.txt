  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Messa? are contradictory. Both statements state that the composer of Messa is not specified, but they imply different things. Statement 1 suggests that there is no information available about the composer, while Statement 2 implies that the identity of the composer is known but not specified in the given context. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
