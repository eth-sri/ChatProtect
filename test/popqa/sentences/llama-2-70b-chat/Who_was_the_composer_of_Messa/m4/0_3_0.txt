Therefore, the composer of Messa is whoever wrote the music for the Mass ordinary, which could be any number of composers throughout history.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Messa? are not contradictory. Both statements provide examples of well-known composers of Mass settings, but they do not claim that these composers specifically wrote the music for Messa. The text explains that the composer of Messa is not specified and could be any number of composers throughout history who wrote music for the Mass ordinary. Therefore, the statements are simply providing additional information about composers who have written Mass settings, but they do not contradict the information provided in the text."
