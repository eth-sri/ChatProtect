  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Heat are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Heat is a film that blends elements of action, drama, and crime genres. The only difference is that statement 1 explicitly labels it as a thriller, while statement 2 does not give it a specific genre label. However, both statements convey the same idea that Heat is a hybrid of different genres."
