  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Arrival are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more specific subgenre within science fiction, which is first contact and communication with extraterrestrial life. Statement 2 is a broader subgenre within science fiction, which is simply first contact. Therefore, both statements are accurate and complement each other in describing the genre of Arrival."
