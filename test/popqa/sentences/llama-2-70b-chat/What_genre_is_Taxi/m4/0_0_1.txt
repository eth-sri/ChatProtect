  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Taxi are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Taxi as a sitcom, which is a subgenre of comedy. The second statement further elaborates on the characteristics of sitcoms, describing them as a type of comedy of manners. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the genre of Taxi."
