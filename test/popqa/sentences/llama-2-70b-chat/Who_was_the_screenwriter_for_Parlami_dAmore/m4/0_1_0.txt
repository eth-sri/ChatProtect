  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Parlami d'Amore? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that it is unclear who wrote the screenplay for the film, while Statement 2 states that the film was directed by Silvio Soldini, which does not provide any information about the screenwriter. Therefore, the two statements do not align and cannot both be true at the same time."
