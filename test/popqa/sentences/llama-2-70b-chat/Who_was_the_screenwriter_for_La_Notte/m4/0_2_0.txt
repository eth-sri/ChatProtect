Statement 1 specifies that the screenplay was written by Antonioni in collaboration with three other individuals, while Statement 2 highlights Antonioni's long-time collaboration with Tonino Guerra specifically. Both statements are true and complement each other in providing a fuller picture of the film's screenwriting process."
