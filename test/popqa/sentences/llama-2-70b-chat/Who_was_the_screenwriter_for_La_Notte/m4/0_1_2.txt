  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for La Notte are contradictory. The first statement identifies Michelangelo Antonioni as the screenwriter and director of the film, while the second statement describes La Notte as a classic of Italian neorealism. However, Antonioni was not associated with the neorealist movement, but rather with the Italian art cinema movement. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
