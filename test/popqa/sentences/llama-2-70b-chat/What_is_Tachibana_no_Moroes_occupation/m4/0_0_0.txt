  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Tachibana no Moroe's occupation are contradictory. The first statement suggests that his occupation is commonly depicted as an archer or hunter, while the second statement claims that he is a singer. These two occupations are vastly different and cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
