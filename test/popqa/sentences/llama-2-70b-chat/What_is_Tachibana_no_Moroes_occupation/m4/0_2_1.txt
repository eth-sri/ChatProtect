While the focus of the text is on Tachibana no Moroe's occupation as an archer or hunter, statement 1 adds that he is also a leader who is respected by the people of the village. Statement 2 further emphasizes his martial skills and the respect he receives from both his peers and adversaries. Both statements provide additional information about Tachibana no Moroe's character and abilities, but do not contradict the initial statement about his occupation."
