  "explanation": "The statements about the director of \"Wish You Were Here\" are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the film has become a cult classic and is now considered a pioneering work in its genre, despite not being a commercial success at the time of its release. The only difference between the two statements is that one specifically refers to the film as a work of psychedelic cinema, while the other refers to it as a work of experimental filmmaking."
