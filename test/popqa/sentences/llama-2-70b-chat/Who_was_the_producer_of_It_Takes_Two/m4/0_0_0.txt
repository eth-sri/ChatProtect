  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of It Takes Two? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the song was produced by Max Martin and Shellback, while Statement 2 claims that it was produced by Maxim Borisov. These are two different names and therefore cannot both be correct. It is possible that one of the statements is incorrect or that there were multiple producers involved in the production of the song. Further research would be needed to determine the accurate answer."
