  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the composer of \"In the Garden\" is not explicitly stated and that the song is a traditional hymn. The first statement adds that the origins of the song are not well-documented, while the second statement simply reiterates that it is a traditional hymn. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
