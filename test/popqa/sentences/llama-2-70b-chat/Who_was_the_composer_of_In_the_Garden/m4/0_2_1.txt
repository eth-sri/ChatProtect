  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"In the Garden\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the composer is not explicitly stated and that the song's origins are not well-documented. The second statement provides possible information about the composer, stating that the melody and lyrics are often attributed to Charles Austin Miles, but also notes that they were selected from a collection of traditional hymns and spirituals. Therefore, both statements provide different perspectives on the composer of the song without contradicting each other."
