  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Ross the Boss are not necessarily contradictory, as power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal. Therefore, it is possible for a band to be classified as both heavy metal and power metal. However, the emphasis on melodic and anthemic songwriting in Statement 1 may suggest a slightly different sound than the more traditional power metal sound associated with Statement 2."
