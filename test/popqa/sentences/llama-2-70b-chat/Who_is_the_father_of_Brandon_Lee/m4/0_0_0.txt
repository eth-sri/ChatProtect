  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Brandon Lee are not contradictory. Both statements identify Bruce Lee as Brandon Lee's father. The only difference is that statement 1 uses the past tense \"was\" to refer to Bruce Lee, while statement 2 uses the present tense \"is\". However, this difference in tense does not change the fact that both statements are identifying Bruce Lee as Brandon Lee's father."
