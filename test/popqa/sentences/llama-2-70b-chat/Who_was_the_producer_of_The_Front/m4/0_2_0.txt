  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Front? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Martin Ritt, the producer of The Front, and his background as a politically active individual who was blacklisted during the McCarthy era or the Red Scare of the 1950s. The only difference is the specific time period mentioned, but this does not contradict the fact that Ritt was the producer of The Front."
