  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Cookie's Fortune are contradictory because they provide different names for the producer. One statement says it was John Epis, while the other says it was Robert Altman. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct and further research is needed to determine the actual producer of the film."
