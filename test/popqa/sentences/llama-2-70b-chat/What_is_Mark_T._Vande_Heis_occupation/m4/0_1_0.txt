  "explanation": "The statements about Mark T. Vande Hei's occupation are not contradictory. While both statements provide different information about the amount of time he has spent in space, they do not contradict the fact that he is an American engineer and a retired NASA astronaut. The first statement provides more specific information about his spaceflight experience, including the missions he flew on, while the second statement simply gives a general estimate of his time in space."
