The first statement mentions that he is a retired NASA astronaut and engineer, but it does not specify his current occupation. The second statement provides additional information about his time as an astronaut, specifically that he went on two spacewalks. The first statement and the second statement are both true and do not contradict each other. The first statement simply provides more comprehensive information about his career, while the second statement focuses on a specific aspect of his time as an astronaut."
