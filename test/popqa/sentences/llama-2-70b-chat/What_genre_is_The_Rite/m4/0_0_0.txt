  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is The Rite? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes The Rite as a supernatural thriller film that incorporates elements of horror and drama, suggesting that it is a blend of different genres. On the other hand, statement 2 simply categorizes The Rite as a horror film, which implies that it belongs to a single genre. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
