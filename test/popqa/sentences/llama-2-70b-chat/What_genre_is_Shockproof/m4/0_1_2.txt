  "explanation": "The statements about Shockproof's genre are not necessarily contradictory, as both mention that he incorporates elements of different subgenres of EDM. However, they do differ in the specific subgenres mentioned, with statement 1 focusing on future bass and statement 2 mentioning dubstep, trap, and drum and bass. It is possible that Shockproof's music incorporates elements of all of these subgenres, or that his style has evolved over time to incorporate different influences. Ultimately, the two statements provide slightly different perspectives on Shockproof's genre, but do not necessarily contradict each other."
