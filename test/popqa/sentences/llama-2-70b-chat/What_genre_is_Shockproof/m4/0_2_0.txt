  "explanation": "The statements about Shockproof's music style are not contradictory. Both statements describe his music as having dreamy and melodic elements, with lush synths and basslines. The only difference is that the first statement uses the word \"emotive\" while the second uses \"atmospheric.\" However, both words can be used to describe the same type of music, so there is no contradiction."
