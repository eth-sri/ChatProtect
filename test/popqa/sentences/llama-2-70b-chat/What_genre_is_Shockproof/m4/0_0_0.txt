  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Shockproof are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Shockproof is an individual artist who produces EDM music, while Statement 2 suggests that Shockproof is a subgenre of EDM. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that Shockproof is an artist who produces music within the subgenre of Shockproof EDM, but this is not explicitly stated in the given text."
