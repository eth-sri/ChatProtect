  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Off the Wall are not contradictory. Both statements identify Michael Jackson as one of the composers of the album, with statement 1 adding that Quincy Jones also contributed to the composition. Statement 2 simply reiterates that Michael Jackson was involved in composing the album. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
