  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Sneakers are contradictory. The first statement says that Phil Alden Robinson was the screenwriter, director, and one of the producers for the film, while the second statement only says that he was the director. Therefore, the second statement contradicts the first statement by omitting the fact that Robinson was also the screenwriter and one of the producers."
