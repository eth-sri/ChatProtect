The first statement identifies Phil Alden Robinson as the screenwriter, director, and producer of the film, while the second statement provides a brief summary of the plot, specifically mentioning the team of security experts hired to steal a top-secret code-breaking or encryption device. Both statements provide different information about the film, but they do not contradict each other."
