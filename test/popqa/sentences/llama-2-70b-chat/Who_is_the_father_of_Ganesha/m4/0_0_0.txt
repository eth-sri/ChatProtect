  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who is the father of Ganesha are contradictory. Although both statements provide the same answer, the repetition of the same statement implies that there is a lack of additional information or explanation to support the answer. Additionally, if there were any disagreement or debate about who Ganesha's father is, the statements do not address or acknowledge it. Therefore, the statements do not provide any clarity or insight into the question and are redundant."
