  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Only You\" are contradictory. The first statement claims that the song was written and composed by Vince Gill and released in 1998 as the second single from his album \"Breathless.\" However, the second statement claims that the song was released in 1990 as a single from Gill's album \"Pocket Full of Gold.\" These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the composer and release date of the song."
