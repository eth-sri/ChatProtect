Statement 1 provides information about the liturgical tradition of the church, which is based on the Byzantine Rite. Statement 2 identifies the church as a Greek-Catholic Church, which refers to its status as an Eastern Catholic Church in communion with Rome. Both statements provide different aspects of the same information and are not in conflict with each other."
