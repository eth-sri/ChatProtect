The Church developed and grew over the centuries, and in the 16th century, it came under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the 17th century, a group of Romanian Orthodox Christians in Transylvania (now part of Romania) entered into communion with the Catholic Church, and the Romanian Greek Catholic Church was established.",
