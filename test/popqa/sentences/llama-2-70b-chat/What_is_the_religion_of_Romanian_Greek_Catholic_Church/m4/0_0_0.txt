  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Romanian Greek Catholic Church are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that the Romanian Greek Catholic Church is a form of Eastern Catholicism that recognizes the authority of the Pope and is in communion with the worldwide Catholic Church. Statement 1 provides more detail about the nature of this communion, while Statement 2 emphasizes the Eastern character of the church. Together, the statements provide a clear and accurate description of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church."
