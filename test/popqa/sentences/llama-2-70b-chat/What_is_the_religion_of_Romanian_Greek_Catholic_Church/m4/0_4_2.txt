  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Romanian Greek Catholic Church are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains the historical development of the Church and how it came under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople in the 16th century. Statement 2 explains how the Church later came under the jurisdiction of the Holy See in 1697. Both statements provide different historical facts about the Church's jurisdiction, but they do not contradict each other."
