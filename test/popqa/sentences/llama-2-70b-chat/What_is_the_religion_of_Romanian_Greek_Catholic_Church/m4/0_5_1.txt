  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Romanian Greek Catholic Church are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the establishment of the Church, with statement 1 emphasizing the role of Romanian Orthodox Christians in its formation and statement 2 providing a specific date and the involvement of the Pope in its establishment. Both statements support the overall description of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church as an Eastern Catholic Church in communion with Rome and part of the Byzantine tradition."
