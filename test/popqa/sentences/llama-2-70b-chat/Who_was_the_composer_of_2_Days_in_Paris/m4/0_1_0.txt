Both statements provide additional information about Alexandre Desplat, the composer of the film's soundtrack. Statement 1 lists some of the other films he has composed music for, while Statement 2 simply reiterates that he is a French composer. Neither statement contradicts the fact that Desplat composed the soundtrack for \"2 Days in Paris.\""
