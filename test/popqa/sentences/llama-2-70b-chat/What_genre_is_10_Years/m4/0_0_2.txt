  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 10 Years are not contradictory, but rather offer different perspectives. Statement 1 acknowledges that the band has been associated with multiple genres, while statement 2 focuses on their primary genre as post-grunge. Both statements can be true simultaneously, as the band's sound may incorporate elements from various genres while still being primarily classified as post-grunge."
