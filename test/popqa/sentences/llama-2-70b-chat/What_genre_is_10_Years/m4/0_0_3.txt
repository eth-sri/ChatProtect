  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 10 Years are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the band is primarily considered to be a post-grunge/alternative rock band, but they have also been associated with other genres such as hard rock and heavy metal. The second statement simply adds that they have also been associated with alternative rock and hard rock, which is not in conflict with the first statement."
