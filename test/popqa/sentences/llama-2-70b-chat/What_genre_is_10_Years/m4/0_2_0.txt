  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 10 Years are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the band has experimented with different styles and sounds, while still primarily being considered a post-grunge/alternative rock band. The second statement further expands on this idea by mentioning specific genres that the band has incorporated into their music. Both statements support the idea that 10 Years' sound is not limited to one specific genre, but rather a blend of various influences."
