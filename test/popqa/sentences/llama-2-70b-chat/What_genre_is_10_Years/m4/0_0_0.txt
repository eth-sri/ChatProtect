  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 10 Years are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the band has been associated with multiple genres, including post-grunge/alternative rock, hard rock, and heavy metal. Statement 2 simply specifies that the band is primarily considered a post-grunge band. Both statements can be true simultaneously, as the band's primary genre can still be post-grunge while also having elements of other genres."
