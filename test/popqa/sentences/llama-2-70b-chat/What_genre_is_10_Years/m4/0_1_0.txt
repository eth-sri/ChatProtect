  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 10 Years are not contradictory. Both statements describe the band's sound as characterized by heavy guitar riffs, strong vocals, and introspective lyrics. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions post-grunge as the primary genre, while statement 2 does not specify a primary genre but still acknowledges the heavy sound and introspective lyrics. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that 10 Years is primarily a post-grunge/alternative rock band, but also incorporates elements of other genres such as hard rock and heavy metal."
