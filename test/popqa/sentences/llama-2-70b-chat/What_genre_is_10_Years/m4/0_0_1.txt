  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 10 Years are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that the band has been associated with multiple genres, including post-grunge, alternative rock, hard rock, and heavy metal. Statement 2 simply narrows down the classification to alternative rock, which is still consistent with the genres mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, both statements can coexist without contradiction."
