  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Greed are not contradictory. While the first statement identifies Erich von Stroheim as the screenwriter, the second statement provides additional information about his involvement in the film, specifically that he also directed and played a different role in the movie. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about von Stroheim's contributions to the film."
