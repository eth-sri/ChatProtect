Both statements acknowledge the significant role that George Martin played in shaping the sound and success of The Beatles. The first statement emphasizes Martin's contribution to the artistic vision of the band, while the second statement highlights his role in achieving commercial success. These two aspects are not mutually exclusive and can coexist in the same producer's work."
