  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Game? are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the book was first published in 2005 and has since become a bestseller, while statement 2 says that the book was first published in 1999. Since the two statements provide different information about the year of publication, they cannot both be true at the same time."
