Both statements acknowledge that the Tanya is a foundational text of the Hasidic movement and that Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi is the author of the text. The only difference between the two statements is that the first one adds that the Tanya is considered one of the most important works of Jewish mysticism and spirituality."
