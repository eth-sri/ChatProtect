  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Chinese Coffee? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the person is not aware of the movie \"Chinese Coffee\" and therefore cannot answer the question about its director. \n\nHowever, Statement 2 contradicts this by providing a direct answer to the question and stating that the director of \"Chinese Coffee\" is Al Pacino."
