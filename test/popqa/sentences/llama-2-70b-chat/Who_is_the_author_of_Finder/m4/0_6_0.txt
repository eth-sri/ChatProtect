  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Finder? are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that it is difficult to identify a single author of a complex software program like Finder, while Statement 2 suggests that there may be individuals who played a significant role in its development but are not publicly recognized. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Finder was likely developed collaboratively by a team of software developers and engineers at Apple, rather than by a single individual."
