  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Finder? are not contradictory. While the text explains that the exact author or team of authors within Apple who created Finder is not publicly credited, statement 1 provides additional information about the history of Finder and how it has evolved since its introduction in 1984. Statement 2 simply specifies that Finder was introduced in 1984 with the release of the Macintosh 128k, which is consistent with the information provided in the text."
