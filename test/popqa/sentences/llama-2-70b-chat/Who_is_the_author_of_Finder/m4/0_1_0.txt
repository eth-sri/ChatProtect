  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Finder? are contradictory. The first statement suggests that the author of Finder is unknown or not explicitly stated, while the second statement provides two specific details about the author - Carla Speed McNeil - and the medium in which Finder exists - a comic book series. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
