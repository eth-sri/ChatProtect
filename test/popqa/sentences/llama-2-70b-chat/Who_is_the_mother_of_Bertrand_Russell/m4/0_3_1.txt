  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Bertrand Russell are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Katherine Stanley Stewart is the mother of Bertrand Russell and that she was married to Viscount Amberley. The only difference is in the way the information is presented, with statement 1 providing additional details about Bertrand Russell's birth order and statement 2 simply stating that he is their son."
