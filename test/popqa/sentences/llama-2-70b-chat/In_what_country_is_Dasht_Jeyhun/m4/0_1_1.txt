While the first statement specifies that Dasht-e Jeyhun is located in the southeastern part of Turkmenistan and covers parts of the Ahal and Balkan provinces, the second statement provides additional information that a large desert area covers most of the country's territory. Therefore, both statements are consistent and provide complementary information about the location and extent of the desert area in Turkmenistan."
