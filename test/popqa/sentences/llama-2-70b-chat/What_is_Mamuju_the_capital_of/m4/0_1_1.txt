  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Mamuju the capital of?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that Mamuju is located in the Indonesian province of West Nusa Tenggara, while Statement 2 states that Mamuju is located in the province of West Sulawesi, Indonesia. These are two different provinces, and therefore cannot both be correct. \n\nAdditionally, Statement 1 does not mention Mamuju being the capital of any region, while Statement 2 does not clarify whether Mamuju is the capital of West Sulawesi or not. Therefore, the statements do not provide a clear answer to the prompt."
