  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Mamuju the capital of?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 implies that Mamuju is not the capital of any country or region, which suggests that it could be the capital of a smaller administrative division such as a province or state. \n\nHowever, Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that Mamuju is not a capital city at all, which means it cannot be the capital of any administrative division. \n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, and they present conflicting information about the status of Mamuju as a capital city."
