  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Family are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Luc Besson's career as a successful French film director, screenwriter, and producer, and mention some of his other notable works. While the second statement is more specific in mentioning \"Leon: The Professional,\" both statements ultimately support the fact that Luc Besson was the screenwriter for The Family."
