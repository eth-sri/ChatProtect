  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Hot Fuzz? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that both Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were involved in writing the screenplay for Hot Fuzz, while Statement 2 suggests that only Edgar Wright was the screenwriter. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
