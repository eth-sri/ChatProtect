The first statement establishes that Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were the screenwriters for Hot Fuzz, while the second statement adds that they also co-wrote the film's sequel, The World's End. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional information about the collaboration between Wright and Pegg on these films."
