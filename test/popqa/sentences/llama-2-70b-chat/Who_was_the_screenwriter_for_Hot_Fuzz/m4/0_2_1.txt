  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Hot Fuzz are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg as the screenwriters and co-writers of the film's story. The second statement provides additional information about the film's director (Edgar Wright) and the main cast members, including Simon Pegg in the lead role. Both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
