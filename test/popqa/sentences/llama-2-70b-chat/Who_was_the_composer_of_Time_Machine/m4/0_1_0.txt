  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 is suggesting that perhaps the name \"Time Machine\" is not the name of a composer, but rather a film or project that may have had a composer. Statement 2 provides information about the composer of a specific film, \"The 400 Blows,\" which is not related to the prompt question. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
