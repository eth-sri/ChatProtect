  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the composer of Time Machine?\" are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that there is no composer associated with the Time Machine. The first statement simply states that the person is not aware of any composer with that name, while the second statement explains that the question is based on false assumptions and provides the correct information that the Time Machine is a novel and not a musical composition."
