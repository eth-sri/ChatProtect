  "explanation": "The statements are contradictory. The first statement claims that 4A Games was the producer of Metro, while the second statement claims that 4A Games was the developer of the game. While the two roles are closely related, they are not the same thing. The producer is responsible for overseeing the development of the game, managing the budget, and ensuring that the game is completed on time and to a high standard. The developer, on the other hand, is responsible for actually creating the game, including designing the levels, programming the mechanics, and creating the art and sound assets. Therefore, while 4A Games may have been both the producer and the developer of Metro, the two statements cannot both be true."
