  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of David Cassidy are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Jack Cassidy had two more children after divorcing David's mother, while statement 2 suggests that he had a daughter named Shaun Cassidy who is also a singer and actor. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide conflicting information about the number and identity of Jack Cassidy's children after his divorce from David's mother."
