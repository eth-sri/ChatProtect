  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of David Cassidy are not contradictory. The first statement directly answers the prompt by identifying Jack Cassidy as David Cassidy's father and also provides additional information about his relationship with David's mother. The second statement provides further information about Jack Cassidy's career as a singer and actor, which is not directly related to his paternity. Therefore, both statements can be true simultaneously without contradicting each other."
