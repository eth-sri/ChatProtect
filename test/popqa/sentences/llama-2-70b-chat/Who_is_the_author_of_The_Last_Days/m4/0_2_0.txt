  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Last Days? are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Scott Westerfeld as the author of the book and provides additional information about it being a young adult science fiction novel published in 2006. However, the second statement is incorrect as it describes a completely different book with a different plot and setting. The Last Days is not set in a post-apocalyptic world where vampires have taken over, but rather concludes the Uglies series. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true and are contradictory."
