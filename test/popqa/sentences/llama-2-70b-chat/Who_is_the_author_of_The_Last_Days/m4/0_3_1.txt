  "explanation": "The statements about the author of The Last Days are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Scott Westerfeld as the author of the book and provides some basic information about it. The second statement provides additional details about the dystopian society depicted in the novel, specifically about the extreme plastic surgery that all people undergo to become \"pretty\". While the second statement does not directly relate to the authorship of the book, it is still a factual statement about the content of the novel. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
