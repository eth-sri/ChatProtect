  "explanation": "The statements about the plot of The Last Days are not contradictory, but they are not directly related to the prompt of who the author is. The first statement describes Dr. Cable's role in the novel as a former \"pretty\" working to bring down the society, while the second statement describes her as a scientist searching for a cure for a disease. However, both statements are accurate descriptions of the plot of The Last Days."
