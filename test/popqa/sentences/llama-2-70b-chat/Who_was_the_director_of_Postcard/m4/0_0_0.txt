  "explanation": "The statements about the director of \"Postcard\" are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Statement 1 indicates that the person is not knowledgeable about the movie, while statement 2 provides information about the director, who is known only by a pseudonym. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide different pieces of information about the movie and its director."
