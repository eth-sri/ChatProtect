It was a departure from his previous work, as it featured more visual and atmospheric elements, and it was the first album where Jarre used the theme of \"sonic paintings\" or \"musical landscapes\", which would become a characteristic of his later work. Jarre produced the album himself, and he also played all the instruments and created all the sound effects on the album.",
