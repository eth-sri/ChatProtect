He is a French composer, performer and record producer, who is known for his pioneering work in the field of electronic music and ambient music. \"Images\" was released in 1976 and it was Jarre's third studio album. It was a departure from his previous work, as it featured more visual and atmospheric elements, and it was the first album where Jarre used the theme of \"sonic paintings\" or \"musical landscapes\", which would become a characteristic of his later work.",

  "explanation": "Statement 1 is not contradictory to the text, as it confirms that Jean Michel Jarre produced the album \"Images\" himself. It also adds that he played all the instruments and created all the sound effects on the album, which further emphasizes his role as the sole producer of the album.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, is contradictory to the text, as it states that Jarre produced the album \"Oxygene\" in 1976, which is not the album being discussed in the text. The text clearly states that the album being discussed is \"Images\", which was also released in 1976, but it was Jarre's third studio album, not his first. Therefore, Statement 2 is not relevant to the prompt and is contradictory to the information provided in the text."
