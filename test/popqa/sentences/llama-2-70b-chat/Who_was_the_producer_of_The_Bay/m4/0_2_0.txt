  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Bay? are not contradictory. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one includes the film Get Out as one of Blum's successful horror films, while the first statement does not mention it. However, this does not contradict the fact that Blum produced The Bay and other successful horror films."
