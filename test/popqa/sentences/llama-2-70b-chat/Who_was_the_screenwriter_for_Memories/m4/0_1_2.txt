  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Memories are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that Katsuhiro Otomo was the screenwriter for the film, as well as a manga artist and director. The second statement provides additional information about Otomo's involvement in the film, specifically that he wrote and directed one of the three short stories that make up Memories, titled \"Magnetic Rose.\" Both statements are consistent with Otomo being the screenwriter for Memories."
