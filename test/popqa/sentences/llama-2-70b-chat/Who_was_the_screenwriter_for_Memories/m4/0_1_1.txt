While the first statement mentions that Katsuhiro Otomo is known for his work as a manga artist and director, it also confirms that he was the screenwriter for the film. The second statement provides additional information about the content of the film, specifically the themes explored in the three short stories. Therefore, both statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
