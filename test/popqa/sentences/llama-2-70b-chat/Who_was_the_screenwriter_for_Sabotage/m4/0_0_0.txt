  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Sabotage? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Skip Woods was the screenwriter for the movie \"Sabotage\", while statement 2 claims that Quentin Tarantino was the screenwriter for the same movie. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be true, making the statements contradictory."
