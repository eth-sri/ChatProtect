  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Survivor\" are contradictory. The first statement claims that Charlie Puth co-wrote the song with David Ross and it charted on Billboard's Hot 100 in 2016. However, the second statement claims that Charlie Puth co-wrote the song with David Hodges, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, it is unclear who the actual co-writer of \"Survivor\" is."
