The first statement claims that Charlie Puth is the composer of the song, while the second statement suggests that the song was only featured in the reality TV show \"Survivor\" as its theme song. However, the actual composer of the song is Destiny's Child, and it was released in 2001 as a single from their album \"Survivor.\" Therefore, neither Charlie Puth nor David Ross were involved in composing the song."
