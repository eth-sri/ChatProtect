  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Jesus? are not contradictory. While the first statement provides information about Mary's role as the mother of Jesus and her selection by God, the second statement provides additional context about Mary's life and where she lived with Joseph. Both statements are consistent with the biblical account of Mary as the mother of Jesus."
