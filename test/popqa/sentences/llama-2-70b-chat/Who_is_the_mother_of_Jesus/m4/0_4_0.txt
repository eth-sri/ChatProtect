She was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter, and they lived in Nazareth.

  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Mary is the mother of Jesus, but they provide additional information about where Jesus was born and raised. Statement 1 specifies that Jesus was born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth by Mary and Joseph, while Statement 2 only mentions the birthplace of Jesus. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
