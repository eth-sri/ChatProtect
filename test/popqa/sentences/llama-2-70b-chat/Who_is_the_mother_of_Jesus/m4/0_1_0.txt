  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Jesus are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Mary, the mother of Jesus. The first statement explains that Mary was chosen by God to bear Jesus, while the second statement emphasizes that Mary was a virgin at the time of Jesus' conception. Together, these statements provide a more complete understanding of Mary's role as the mother of Jesus."
