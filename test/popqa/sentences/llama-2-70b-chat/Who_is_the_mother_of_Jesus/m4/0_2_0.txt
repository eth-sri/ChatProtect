  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Jesus? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Mary, the mother of Jesus, and her relationship with Joseph, a carpenter. The first statement adds that they lived in Nazareth, while the second statement simply states that they were betrothed. Both statements are consistent with the biblical account of Mary and Joseph's relationship."
