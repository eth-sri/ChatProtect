  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Emotions? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the song \"Emotions\" was composed by Mariah Carey and David Cole, while Statement 2 claims that it was written by Mariah Carey and David Foster. The difference between \"composed\" and \"written\" is significant in the context of music, as composing refers to creating the melody and musical arrangement, while writing refers to the lyrics. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true, as they attribute the composition of the song to different individuals."
