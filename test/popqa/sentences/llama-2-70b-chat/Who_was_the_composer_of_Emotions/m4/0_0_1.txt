  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Emotions? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that \"Emotions\" was written and composed by both Mariah Carey and David Cole, while Statement 2 only credits Mariah Carey as the composer. Therefore, Statement 1 includes David Cole as a co-composer, while Statement 2 does not. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, making them contradictory."
