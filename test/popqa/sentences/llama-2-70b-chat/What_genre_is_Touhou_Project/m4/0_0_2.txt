  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Touhou Project are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a detailed description of the genre, specifying that it falls under the shooter genre and is a danmaku game. Statement 2 simply reiterates that the majority of the games in the series fall under the shooter genre, which is consistent with the information provided in Statement 1. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Touhou Project is primarily a shooter game series."
