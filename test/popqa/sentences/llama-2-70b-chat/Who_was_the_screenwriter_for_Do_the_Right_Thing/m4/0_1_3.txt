  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Do the Right Thing are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Spike Lee not only wrote the screenplay but also directed and starred in the film, while Statement 2 suggests that the screenplay was also directed by Spike Lee. However, it is not possible for the screenplay to be directed as it is a written document that serves as a blueprint for the film. Therefore, Statement 2 is incorrect and contradicts Statement 1."
