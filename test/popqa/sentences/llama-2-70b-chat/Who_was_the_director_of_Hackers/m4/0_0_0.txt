  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Hackers? are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that Iain Softley was the director of the 1995 film \"Hackers\". The only difference is the use of quotation marks in the first statement, which is not necessary as \"Hackers\" is not a title that requires quotation marks."
