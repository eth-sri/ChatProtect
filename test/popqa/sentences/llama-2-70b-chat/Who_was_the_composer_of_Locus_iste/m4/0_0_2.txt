  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Locus iste are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Locus iste is a Gregorian chant, which is a type of music that was not composed by a specific individual, but rather is a part of a tradition that has been passed down through the centuries. The second statement further emphasizes this point by stating that Locus iste has been passed down through generations as a traditional chant. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Locus iste was not composed by a specific individual."
