  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Silk? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the author and the novel, but they both confirm that Alessandro Baricco is the author of Silk. Statement 1 provides more details about Baricco's background as an Italian writer and director, and the year of publication of the novel. Statement 2 is a more straightforward statement that confirms Baricco's authorship of Silk."
