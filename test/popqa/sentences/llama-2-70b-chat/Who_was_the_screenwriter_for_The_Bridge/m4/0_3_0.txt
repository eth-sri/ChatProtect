Statement 1 mentions that Hans Rosenfeldt is known for his work on other TV series such as The Sandhamn Murders and Marcella, while statement 2 mentions that he is known for his work on other TV series such as The Sandhamn Murders and Real Humans. The two statements differ in the TV series mentioned, with statement 1 mentioning Marcella and statement 2 mentioning Real Humans. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
