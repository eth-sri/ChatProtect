  "explanation": "The statements about Hans Rosenfeldt's work on other TV series are not contradictory. Both statements mention his work on The Sandhamn Murders, but statement 1 also includes his work on Marcella, while statement 2 includes his work on Wallander. These are simply different examples of other TV series that Rosenfeldt has worked on, and do not contradict each other."
