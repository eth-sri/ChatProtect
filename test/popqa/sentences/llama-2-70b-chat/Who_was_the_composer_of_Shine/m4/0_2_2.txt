  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement describes \"Shine\" as a popular English nursery rhyme and song often recited or sung with hand gestures, the second statement provides additional information about the song's origins and tune. It explains that the song is based on a theme from Holst's \"The Planets\" suite, which was composed by Gustav Holst. Therefore, both statements support the fact that Gustav Holst was the composer of \"Shine.\""
