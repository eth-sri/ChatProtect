  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Shine\" are not contradictory. However, they are not relevant to the prompt, which specifically asks for the composer of the song. The text provides the answer that Gustav Holst was the composer of \"Shine\". The two statements provide additional information about the song's associations with either Christmas or children's birthday parties, but do not contradict the information about the composer."
