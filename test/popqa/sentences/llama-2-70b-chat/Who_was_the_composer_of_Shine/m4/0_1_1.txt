  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Shine? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the song \"Shine,\" including alternative titles and the year it was composed by Gustav Holst. Statement 2 provides further context about the song's inclusion in Holst's larger work, \"The Planets,\" and its alternate title within that suite. Both statements are consistent with the initial statement that Gustav Holst was the composer of \"Shine.\""
