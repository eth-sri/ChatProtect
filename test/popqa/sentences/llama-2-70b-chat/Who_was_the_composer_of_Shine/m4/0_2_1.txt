  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Shine? are contradictory. The first statement describes \"Shine\" as a popular English nursery rhyme and song that is often recited or sung with hand gestures, while the second statement describes it as being based on a tune from Holst's composition \"Jupiter\" from the orchestral suite \"The Planets\". While both statements provide information about \"Shine\", they offer different perspectives on the origins and nature of the song."
