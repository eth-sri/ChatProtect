While Statement 1 provides additional information about the success and longevity of the show, it does not contradict the initial statement that Charles Strouse was the composer of the music for \"Annie\". Statement 2 simply confirms that the show was first performed on Broadway in 1977, which is consistent with the information provided in the initial text."
