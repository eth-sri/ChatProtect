  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Big Road are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Federico Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, and Ennio Flaiano collaborated on the screenplay, with the story being based on one by Fellini and Pinelli. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which simplifies the information by stating that the screenplay was based on a story by Fellini and Pinelli without explicitly mentioning the collaboration between the three writers."
