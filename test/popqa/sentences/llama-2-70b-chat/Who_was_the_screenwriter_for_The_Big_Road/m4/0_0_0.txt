  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Big Road? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Federico Fellini was the screenwriter for The Big Road, while Statement 2 claims that Upton Sinclair was the screenwriter. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
