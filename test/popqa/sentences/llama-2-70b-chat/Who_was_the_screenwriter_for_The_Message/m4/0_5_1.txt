The first statement correctly states that Moustapha Akkad was the director and producer of \"The Message\" and that the screenwriter credits are not widely available. The second statement, however, incorrectly states that Akkad emigrated to the United States in 1930, which is the same year he was born. This is impossible and contradicts the information provided in the text that Akkad emigrated to the United States in the 1950s."
