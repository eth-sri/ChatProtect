  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Message? are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Moustapha Akkad was the producer and director of the film, while statement 2 says that he was also the writer of the film. However, the beginning of the text states that the individual credits for the writers of the film are not widely available, so it is unclear who exactly wrote the script. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say whether statement 2 is true or false."
