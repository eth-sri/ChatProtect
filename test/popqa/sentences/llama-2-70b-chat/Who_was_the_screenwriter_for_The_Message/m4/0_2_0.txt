  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for The Message are not contradictory, but rather provide different pieces of information. Statement 1 suggests that the script was a collaborative effort, but the specific writers are not credited. Statement 2 suggests that the screenwriter is unknown, which could be due to a lack of available information or a deliberate decision not to credit a specific writer. Both statements acknowledge that the identity of the screenwriter for The Message is not explicitly stated."
