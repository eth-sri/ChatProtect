  "explanation": "The statements about Crystal Shawanda's genre are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different perspectives on the elements that make up her music. Both statements agree that her music combines elements of country, pop, and rock, but the second statement adds the descriptor \"traditional\" to country, suggesting that Shawanda's music may draw more heavily on classic country sounds. Overall, both statements support the idea that Shawanda's genre is a blend of multiple styles."
