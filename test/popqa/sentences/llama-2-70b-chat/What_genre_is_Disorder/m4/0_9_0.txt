  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Disorder are not contradictory. While Statement 1 focuses on the specific themes and techniques commonly used in psychological horror films, Statement 2 broadens the scope to include the exploration of the supernatural. However, both statements acknowledge the common themes of mental illness and the blurring of reality in psychological thrillers, and both suggest that atmosphere and tension are important elements in the genre. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
