  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Disorder are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the film's use of atmosphere, tension, and exploration of mental illness and hallucinations as contributing factors to its classification as a psychological horror film. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions the focus on the protagonist's psychological state, while statement 2 emphasizes the slow-burning atmosphere and tension. However, both statements ultimately support the same genre classification."
