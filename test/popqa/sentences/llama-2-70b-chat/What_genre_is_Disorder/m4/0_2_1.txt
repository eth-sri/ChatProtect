  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Disorder are not contradictory. Both statements describe the film as a psychological thriller that follows a young French soldier named Vincent who is struggling with a mental disorder after serving in the military. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Vincent's disorder is post-traumatic stress disorder, while statement 1 does not specify the exact disorder. However, both statements accurately describe the genre of the film as a psychological thriller."
