  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Disorder are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the common themes explored in psychological thrillers, such as mental illness, hallucinations, trauma, and the blurring of reality. While the second statement emphasizes the theme of trauma, it does not contradict the first statement, which also mentions the blurring of reality and mental illness. Therefore, both statements complement each other in describing the genre of Disorder."
