  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of First Things First? are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the book was first published in 1989, while Statement 2 says that the book was first published in 1997. Since the publication date of the book is a factual detail, it cannot have two different dates. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
