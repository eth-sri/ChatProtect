  "explanation": "The two statements about Muhammad Ali's religion are not contradictory. They both state that he converted to Sunni Islam in 1975, which means that he left the Nation of Islam and embraced a different branch of Islam. The first statement provides additional information about his initial conversion to Islam in 1964 and his affiliation with the Nation of Islam before his later conversion to Sunni Islam. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
