  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Muhammad Ali are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that he was a Muslim and that he converted to Islam in 1964. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that he was a member of the Nation of Islam, while statement 2 simply states that he was declared a Muslim in 1964. However, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
