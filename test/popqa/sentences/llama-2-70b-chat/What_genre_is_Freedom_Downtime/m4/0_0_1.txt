  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Freedom Downtime are contradictory. The first statement describes Freedom Downtime as a subgenre of electronic dance music, while the second statement describes it as a subgenre of electronic dance music that originated in the early 1990s. While both statements mention electronic dance music, the first statement does not specify a time period, while the second statement does. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
