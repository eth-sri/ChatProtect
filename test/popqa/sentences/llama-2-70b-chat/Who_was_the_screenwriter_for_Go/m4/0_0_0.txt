  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Go? are not contradictory. They both provide the same information that Doug Liman was the screenwriter for the movie Go. The only difference is the use of parentheses in the first statement, which is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the statement."
