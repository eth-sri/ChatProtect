  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Levi? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Levi's birth and his father Jacob, but they do not contradict each other. Statement 1 refers to the chapters in Genesis where the story of Levi's birth and the naming of his sons can be found, while Statement 2 specifically mentions the verses where the story of Levi's birth and the origins of his name can be found. Both statements support the fact that Jacob is the father of Levi."
