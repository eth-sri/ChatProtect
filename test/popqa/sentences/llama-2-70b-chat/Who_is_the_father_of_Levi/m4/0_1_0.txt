  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Levi are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Jacob is the father of Levi and that he was born to Jacob's wife Leah as the third son. They provide additional information about Levi's birth order and his mother, but do not contradict the fact that Jacob is his father."
