  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Joy Luck Club are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Laura Ziskin worked closely with the film's director, Wayne Wang, to bring the story to life. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions Ziskin's collaboration with Amy Tan, the author of the novel on which the film is based. However, both statements agree that Ziskin played a significant role in the production of the film."
