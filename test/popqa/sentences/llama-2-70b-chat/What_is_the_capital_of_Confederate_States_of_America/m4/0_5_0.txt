The CSA was established in 1861 and lasted until 1865, when it was defeated by the Union in the American Civil War. The capital of the Confederate States of America was Richmond, Virginia. Richmond was chosen as the capital because it was a strategic location, situated near the center of the Confederacy and at the head of the James River, which provided a means of transportation and communication. The city was also home to many prominent Confederate leaders, including President Jefferson Davis, who resided in the White House of the Confederacy, a mansion that served as the official residence of the Confederate president.",
