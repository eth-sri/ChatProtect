The CSA was established in 1861 and lasted until 1865, when it was defeated by the Union in the American Civil War. The capital of the Confederate States of America was Richmond, Virginia. Richmond was chosen as the capital because it was a strategic location, situated near the center of the Confederacy and at the head of the James River, which provided a means of transportation and communication.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Confederate States of America are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Richmond, Virginia, as the capital of the Confederacy, including the fact that it was home to many prominent Confederate leaders, including President Jefferson Davis, who resided in the White House of the Confederacy. The second statement simply reiterates this information in a slightly different way."
