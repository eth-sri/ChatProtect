The CSA was established in 1861 and lasted until 1865, when it was defeated by the Union in the American Civil War. The capital of the Confederate States of America was Richmond, Virginia. Richmond was chosen as the capital because it was a strategic location, situated near the center of the Confederacy and at the head of the James River, which provided a means of transportation and communication.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Confederate States of America are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Richmond, Virginia was the capital of the Confederacy and that it was home to many prominent Confederate leaders, including President Jefferson Davis. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions the White House of the Confederacy as the official residence of the Confederate president, while statement 2 simply states that Davis served as the President of the Confederate States of America. However, both statements are consistent in identifying Richmond as the capital of the Confederacy."
