  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Confederate States of America are not contradictory. Both statements explain that Richmond was chosen as the capital because of its strategic location and transportation infrastructure. The first statement adds that Richmond was situated near the center of the Confederacy and at the head of the James River, while the second statement emphasizes the importance of transportation in the decision. However, both statements ultimately agree that Richmond's location and infrastructure were key factors in its selection as the capital of the Confederate States of America."
