  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Pilot? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about J.J. Abrams' career as a director, listing other notable television shows and movies he has directed. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions the Star Trek film franchise, while statement 2 mentions Mission: Impossible III. However, this does not contradict the fact that J.J. Abrams directed the pilot episode of Lost."
