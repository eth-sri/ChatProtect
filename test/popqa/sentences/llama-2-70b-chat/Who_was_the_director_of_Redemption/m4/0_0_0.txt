  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Redemption? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the director of Redemption was Jason Statham, while Statement 2 claims that the director of Redemption is Francis Lawrence. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that one of the statements is incorrect or that there are multiple directors associated with the film. Further research would be needed to determine the accurate information about the director(s) of Redemption."
