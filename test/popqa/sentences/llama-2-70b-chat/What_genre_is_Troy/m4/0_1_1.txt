  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Troy are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides background information about the source material for the film, while statement 2 describes the genre in which the film falls. The fact that Troy is based on an epic poem does not necessarily dictate its genre, as adaptations can take creative liberties and incorporate elements from different genres. Therefore, the two statements complement each other in providing a fuller understanding of the film."
