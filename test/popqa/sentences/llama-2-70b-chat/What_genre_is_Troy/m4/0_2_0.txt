  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Troy are not necessarily contradictory, but they offer different perspectives on how to classify the film. Statement 1 suggests that Troy can be classified as a combination of historical drama, action-adventure, and epic, which emphasizes the film's various elements and appeals to different audiences. Statement 2, on the other hand, suggests that Troy can be classified as historical fiction, which emphasizes the film's fictionalized elements and its departure from historical accuracy. Both statements offer valid interpretations of the film's genre, but they prioritize different aspects of the film's storytelling and production."
