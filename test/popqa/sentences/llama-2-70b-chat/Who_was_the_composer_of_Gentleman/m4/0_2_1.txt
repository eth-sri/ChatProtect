  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Gentleman\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the composer may be unknown or that the song was a traditional piece, while Statement 2 provides additional information that the song was released as a single by The Beatles. The fact that the composer is not specified in the text does not necessarily mean that it contradicts the information provided in Statement 2. It is possible that The Beatles covered the song without knowing the original composer or that the composer's name was not included in the release. Therefore, both statements can coexist without contradicting each other."
