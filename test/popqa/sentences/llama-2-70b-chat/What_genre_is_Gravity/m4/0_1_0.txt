Statement 1 categorizes Gravity as a space drama and survival film, while Statement 2 categorizes it as a space thriller. While both statements agree that Gravity is a science fiction film, they differ in their specific categorization of the genre. A drama and a thriller are two distinct genres, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
