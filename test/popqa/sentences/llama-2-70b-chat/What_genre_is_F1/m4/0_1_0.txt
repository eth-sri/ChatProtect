  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of F1 are not contradictory. Statement 1 simply identifies F1 as a form of motorsport, while statement 2 provides additional information about the characteristics of F1 as a high-speed, high-tech sport that requires a combination of driver skill, team strategy, and technological innovation. Both statements are consistent with F1 being a genre of motor racing."
