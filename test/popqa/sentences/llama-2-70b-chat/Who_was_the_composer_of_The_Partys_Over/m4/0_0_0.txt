  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of The Party's Over? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the song was written by three composers: Willie Nelson, Carl Stutz, and Ed Nelson. However, statement 2 specifically states that the song was composed by Willie Nelson alone. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
