  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of The Party's Over? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the song was written by three composers: Willie Nelson, Carl Stutz, and Ed Nelson, while Statement 2 specifically states that it was written by Willie Nelson alone. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present conflicting information about the authorship of the song."
