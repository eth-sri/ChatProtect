  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"The Party's Over\" are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the song was a hit for Willie Nelson and reached high positions on the country music charts. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically states that the song reached the top of the charts, while statement 1 simply states that it reached the top 10. However, this difference in specificity does not contradict the fact that Willie Nelson was the composer of the song."
