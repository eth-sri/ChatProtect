  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Guide? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Dev Anand was the producer of the movie Guide, while statement 2 claims that David Lean was the producer. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other. It is important to note that only one of these statements can be correct, and further research or clarification is needed to determine the actual producer of the movie Guide."
