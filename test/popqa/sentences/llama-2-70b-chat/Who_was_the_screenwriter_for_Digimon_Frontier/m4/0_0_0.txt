  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Digimon Frontier? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the screenwriter for Digimon Frontier was Chiaki J. Konaka, while statement 2 claims that it was Saha Tetsuya. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
