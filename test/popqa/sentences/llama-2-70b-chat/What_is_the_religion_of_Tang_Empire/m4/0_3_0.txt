  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Tang Empire are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the Tang dynasty supported Buddhism and built temples and monasteries, sponsored translations of Buddhist scriptures, and promoted Buddhist teachings. The only difference is that statement 2 provides more detail about the extent of the Tang dynasty's support for Buddhism, including the involvement of officials in promoting the religion. Overall, both statements support the idea that Buddhism was a significant religion during the Tang Empire."
