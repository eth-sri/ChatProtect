During this time, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and various other religions coexisted and influenced each other. Buddhism, which originated in India and was introduced to China during the Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), gained significant popularity during the Tang Empire. The emperors of the Tang dynasty supported Buddhism and built many temples and monasteries throughout the empire. Buddhist monks and scholars from India, Central Asia, and other parts of Asia traveled to China to translate Buddhist scriptures and spread the teachings of Buddhism. Taoism, which originated in China, was also popular during the Tang Empire. Taoist philosophy emphasizes living in harmony with nature and seeking spiritual balance within oneself.",
