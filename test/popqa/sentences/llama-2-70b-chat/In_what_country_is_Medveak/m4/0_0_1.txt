  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, as they both convey the same idea that Medve\u0161\u010dak is not a real country in the world. While statement 1 explicitly states that it is a fictional country, statement 2 implies the same by stating that it does not exist in any real-world country. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Medve\u0161\u010dak is not a real country."
