  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Prom are contradictory. Statement 1 describes Prom as a romantic comedy film directed by Joe Nussbaum and produced by Justin Springer, Shasta Proof, and Ted Griffin, while Statement 2 describes it as a romantic comedy film directed by Jason Moore. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the director of the film. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
