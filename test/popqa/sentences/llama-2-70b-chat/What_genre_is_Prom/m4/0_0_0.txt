  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Prom? are not contradictory. The first statement provides information about the specific movie titled \"Prom,\" including its director and producers, and identifies it as a romantic comedy. The second statement describes prom as a type of dance, which is not necessarily a genre in the same way that a film genre is defined. Therefore, the two statements are not in conflict with each other."
