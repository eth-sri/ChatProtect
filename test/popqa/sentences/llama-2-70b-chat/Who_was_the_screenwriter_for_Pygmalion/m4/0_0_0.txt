  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Pygmalion are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that George Bernard Shaw was the screenwriter for the 1938 film adaptation of Pygmalion, while also acknowledging that he wrote the play on which the film was based. Statement 2, on the other hand, simply states that George Bernard Shaw was the screenwriter for Pygmalion, without specifying which version of the story he wrote for. Therefore, the two statements cannot be reconciled as they present different information."
