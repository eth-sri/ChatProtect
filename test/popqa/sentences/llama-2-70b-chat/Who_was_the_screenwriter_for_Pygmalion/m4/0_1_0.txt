The first statement provides information about George Bernard Shaw being the screenwriter for the 1938 film adaptation of Pygmalion and also the writer of the play on which the film was based. The second statement adds to this information by stating that Shaw was also the producer of the film. Both statements provide complementary information about Shaw's involvement in the film adaptation of Pygmalion."
