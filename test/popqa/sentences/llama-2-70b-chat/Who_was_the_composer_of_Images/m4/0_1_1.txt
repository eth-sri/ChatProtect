  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Images? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the composition \"Images,\" including that it is a suite of six pieces for solo piano and that it was composed between 1901 and 1905. Statement 2 simply specifies the year in which Debussy composed \"Images.\" Both statements are consistent with the fact that Claude Debussy is the composer of \"Images.\""
