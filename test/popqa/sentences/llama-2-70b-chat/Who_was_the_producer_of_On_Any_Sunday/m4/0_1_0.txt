  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of On Any Sunday, Bruce Brown, are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Brown's background and interests, but they do not contradict each other. The first statement highlights his work on documentaries and sports films, while the second statement emphasizes his passion for motorsports. These two aspects of Brown's career and interests can coexist without contradiction."
