  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's religious views are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Illich's religious views were influenced by different factors, such as his experiences in poor communities and his critique of modern society. These factors likely shaped his beliefs about the role of religion in promoting social justice and the need for radical change. Therefore, both statements provide complementary insights into the complex nature of Illich's religious views."
