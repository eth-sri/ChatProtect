  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's religion are not contradictory. While statement 1 mentions his criticism of capitalism and Marxist influence, it does not negate his Catholic faith. Statement 2 further explains how his Catholic faith was influenced by his experiences in poor communities and his advocacy for social justice. Both statements provide different aspects of Illich's religious beliefs and do not contradict each other."
