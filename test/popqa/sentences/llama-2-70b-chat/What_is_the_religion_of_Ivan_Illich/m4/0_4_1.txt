  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's education are not contradictory, but they do provide different information. Statement 1 indicates that he earned a doctorate in theology from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, while Statement 2 suggests that he earned a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University. Both degrees are related to the study of Catholicism, but they are distinct fields of study. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide additional information about Illich's education and expertise."
