  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they provide different information about Ivan Illich's birthplace. The first statement states that he was born in Dresden, Germany, to a family of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, while the second statement states that he was born in Dolgchrome, Russia. However, both statements agree that Ivan Illich was a Catholic priest, philosopher, and theologian who was known for his critiques of modern society and his advocacy for social justice. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other regarding Ivan Illich's religion."
