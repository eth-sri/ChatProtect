  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's religion are not contradictory. While he was a Catholic priest and theologian, he was critical of the institutional Church and its emphasis on ritual and dogma. He believed that the Church should be more focused on promoting social justice and serving the needs of the poor, which aligns with the principles of liberation theology. Therefore, both statements are consistent with his religious views and beliefs."
