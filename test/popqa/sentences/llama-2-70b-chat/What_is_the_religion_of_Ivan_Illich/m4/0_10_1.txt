  "prefix": " Ivan Illich was a Russian-born Catholic priest, philosopher, and theologian. He was a prominent figure in the Catholic Church in the 20th century and was known for his critiques of modern society and his advocacy for social justice. Illich was born in 1904 in Dresden, Germany, to a family of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. He was raised in a devoutly Catholic household and studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he was ordained as a priest in 1929. He went on to earn a doctorate in theology from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Illich's religious views were deeply influenced by his experience of living and working in poor, urban communities in Europe and Latin America. He became known for his critique of the institutional Church and its emphasis on ritual and dogma, arguing that the Church should be more focused on promoting social justice and serving the needs of the poor. Illich was also heavily influenced by Marxist thought and was critical of capitalism and the exploitation of the working class. He saw the Church as having a responsibility to speak out against social injustice and to work towards creating a more equitable society. Despite his critiques of the Church and his advocacy for social change, Illich remained a devout Catholic throughout his life.",
