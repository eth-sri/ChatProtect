  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's religion are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was ordained as a priest in 1929 after studying at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, while statement 2 says that he was ordained a priest in 1926. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different years for his ordination."
