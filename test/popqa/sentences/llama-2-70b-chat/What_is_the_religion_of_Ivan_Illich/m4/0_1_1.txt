  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's religion are not contradictory. Both statements agree that he was a prominent figure in the Catholic Church in the 20th century. However, statement 1 emphasizes his advocacy for social justice, while statement 2 highlights his controversial ideas and critiques of modern society and the Church. These differences in emphasis do not contradict each other, but rather provide different perspectives on his beliefs and contributions."
