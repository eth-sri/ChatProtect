  "explanation": "The statements about Ivan Illich's religion are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Illich's religious beliefs and experiences living and working in poor communities influenced his views. The only difference is the order in which these influences are presented. Statement 1 emphasizes Illich's experiences first, while Statement 2 emphasizes his religious beliefs first. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that Illich's religion and experiences shaped his worldview."
