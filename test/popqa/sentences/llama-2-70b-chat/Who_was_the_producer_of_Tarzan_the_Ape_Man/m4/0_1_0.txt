  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Tarzan, the Ape Man? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about David O. Selznick, the producer of the film. Statement 1 lists some of the other classic films he produced during Hollywood's Golden Age, while Statement 2 emphasizes his prominence as a film producer in the 20th century. Neither statement contradicts the fact that Selznick was the producer of Tarzan, the Ape Man."
