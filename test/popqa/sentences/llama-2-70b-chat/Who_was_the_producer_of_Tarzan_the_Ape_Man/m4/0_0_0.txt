  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Tarzan, the Ape Man are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. Statement 1 claims that David O. Selznick was the producer, while statement 2 claims that Dino De Laurentiis was the producer. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
