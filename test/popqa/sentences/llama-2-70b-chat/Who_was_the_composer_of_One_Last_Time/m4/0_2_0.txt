  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who was the composer of \"One Last Time\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the song was written by Ariana Grande, David Foster, and hamnasamples, while statement 2 claims that it was written by Ariana Grande, David Guetta, and Savan Kotecha. The two statements have different sets of composers, so they cannot both be true."
