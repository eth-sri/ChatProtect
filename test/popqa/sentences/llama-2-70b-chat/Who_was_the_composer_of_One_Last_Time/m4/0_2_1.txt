  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the composer of \"One Last Time\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the song was written by Ariana Grande, David Foster, and hamnasamples, and produced by Foster. However, statement 2 claims that it was produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with no mention of Foster. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
