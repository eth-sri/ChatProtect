  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Circuit are not contradictory. Statement 1 simply indicates that the person is not familiar with the movie \"Circuit\" and therefore cannot answer the question. Statement 2 provides information about the director of \"Circuit\" and their lack of knowledge about a different movie, \"The Matrix.\" These statements do not contradict each other as they are addressing different topics."
