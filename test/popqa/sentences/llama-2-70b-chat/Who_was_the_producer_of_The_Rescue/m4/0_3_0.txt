While the text mentions that The Rescue was John Nathan-Turner's first story as producer, it does not specify when it was broadcast. Statement 1 clarifies that The Rescue was part of Season 19, which was broadcast in 1982. Statement 2 provides additional information about The Rescue, stating that it was a four-part serial that aired in 1982. Therefore, both statements complement the information provided in the text."
