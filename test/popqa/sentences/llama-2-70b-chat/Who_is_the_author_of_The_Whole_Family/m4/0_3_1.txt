The first statement provides information about the anonymity of the author and the lack of a definitive answer regarding their identity. The second statement provides a time frame for when the novel was written, which is consistent with the publication date of 1897 mentioned in the first statement. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the novel and its authorship."
