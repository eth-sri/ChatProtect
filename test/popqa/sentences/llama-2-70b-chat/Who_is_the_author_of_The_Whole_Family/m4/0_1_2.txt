  "explanation": "The two statements about the author of The Whole Family are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the identity of the author is unknown and has not been definitively established. The first statement adds that the author is anonymous, but it does not contradict the second statement. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
