While the first statement provides information about the screenwriter and the film, specifically that Akira Kurosawa was the screenwriter for \"Dreams,\" and that he was a renowned Japanese film director, screenwriter, and producer, the second statement provides additional information about the film itself, specifically that it was a collection of eight short stories or films, each with its own unique theme and visual style, exploring different aspects of human dreams. Both statements provide complementary information about the film and its creator."
