  "alt": "It is a dogma in the Catholic Church, declared infallible by Pope Pius XII in 1950.",
  "prefix": " The Assumption of Mary is a belief held by some Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some Eastern Catholic Churches, that the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, was taken up bodily into heaven at the end of her life. This belief is often associated with the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which holds that Mary was born without sin and was preserved from the stain of original sin throughout her life. The Assumption of Mary is not considered a separate religion, but rather a belief within the larger Christian tradition. It is not a central tenet of the Christian faith, and there are many Christians who do not accept this belief.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Assumption of Mary are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the belief in the Assumption of Mary is important for those who hold it, while statement 2 provides additional information about the Catholic Church's official stance on the belief. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the Assumption of Mary is a belief held by some Christians, but not all, and that it is not a separate religion but rather a part of the larger Christian tradition."
