  "orig": "It is not a central tenet of the Christian faith, and there are many Christians who do not accept this belief.",
  "alt": "It is not a distinct religious denomination.",
  "prefix": " The Assumption of Mary is a belief held by some Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some Eastern Catholic Churches, that the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, was taken up bodily into heaven at the end of her life. This belief is often associated with the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which holds that Mary was born without sin and was preserved from the stain of original sin throughout her life. The Assumption of Mary is not considered a separate religion, but rather a belief within the larger Christian tradition.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Assumption of Mary are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that the belief in the Assumption of Mary is not universally accepted among Christians, while the second statement emphasizes that it is not a separate religious denomination. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the Assumption of Mary is a belief held within the larger Christian tradition, but not a defining characteristic of any particular Christian denomination."
