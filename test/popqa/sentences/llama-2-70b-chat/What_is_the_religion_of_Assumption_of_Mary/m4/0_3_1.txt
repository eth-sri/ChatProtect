  "alt": "Many Christians, including Protestants and some Eastern Orthodox denominations, do not accept the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary.",
  "prefix": " The Assumption of Mary is a belief held by some Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some Eastern Catholic Churches, that the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, was taken up bodily into heaven at the end of her life. This belief is often associated with the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which holds that Mary was born without sin and was preserved from the stain of original sin throughout her life. The Assumption of Mary is not considered a separate religion, but rather a belief within the larger Christian tradition.",
