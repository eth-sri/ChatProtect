  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is London the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more comprehensive answer by stating that London is the capital of both England and the United Kingdom, while Statement 2 only mentions England. However, both statements agree that London is a capital city, and Statement 2 can be seen as a subset of Statement 1. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two statements."
