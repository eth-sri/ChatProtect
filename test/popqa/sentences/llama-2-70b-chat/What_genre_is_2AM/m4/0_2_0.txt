  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of 2AM are not contradictory. Both statements describe the group as being known for their soulful R&B ballads and emotional vocals. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that they are often categorized as a K-pop group, which is not necessarily contradictory to their R&B and ballad-style music. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the genre of 2AM."
