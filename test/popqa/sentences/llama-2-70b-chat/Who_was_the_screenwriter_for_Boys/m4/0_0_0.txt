  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Boys? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Stacy Cochran was the screenwriter for the film \"Boys\", while statement 2 claims that Ethan Cohen was the screenwriter for the same film. As both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other."
