  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Boys? are contradictory. The first statement says that Stacy Cochran was the screenwriter for the film, while the second statement says that she directed it. Therefore, one of the statements must be incorrect. In this case, the first statement is correct, as Stacy Cochran did write the screenplay for Boys, but the second statement is incorrect, as she did not direct the film. The director of Boys was actually John Singleton."
