  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Face to Face? are contradictory because Statement 1 mentions hit singles \"New York Groove\" and \"I'm in the Dark,\" which were not on the Face to Face album produced by Bob Ezrin. Statement 2 mentions hit singles \"Don't Fear the Reaper\" and \"Crazy on You,\" which were not on the Face to Face album either. Therefore, the two statements are not related to the topic of the producer of Face to Face."
