  "prefix": " Report is a type of nonfiction writing that is used to communicate information, analyze data, and make recommendations to a specific audience. It is not a literary genre in the classical sense, but rather a genre of technical writing. Reports are often used in academic, business, and technical settings to convey research findings, evaluate a situation, or propose solutions to a problem.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about the genre of Report are not contradictory. They both describe the typical structure of a report, which includes an introduction, methodology section, results section, discussion, and conclusion. The only difference is that statement 1 explicitly lists the sections in order, while statement 2 uses the word \"typically\" to indicate that these sections are commonly included in reports."
