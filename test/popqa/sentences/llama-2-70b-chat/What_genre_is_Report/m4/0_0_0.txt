  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Report? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 defines report as a type of nonfiction writing that is used to communicate information, analyze data, and make recommendations to a specific audience. This definition suggests that report is a written genre of nonfiction.\n\nOn the other hand, statement 2 defines report as a news magazine program. This definition suggests that report is a broadcast genre of journalism.\n\nSince the two statements describe report as two different genres, they are contradictory."
