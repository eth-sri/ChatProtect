  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement mentions other writers who contributed to the show, it still acknowledges Damon Lindelof as the screenwriter and co-creator of Lost. The second statement also mentions additional writers who worked on the show, but again, it does not contradict the fact that Lindelof was the main screenwriter and showrunner."
