  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Lost are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Damon Lindelof wrote or co-wrote many episodes of the show, including the pilot and the finales. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that Lindelof was responsible for developing the overall story arc and mythology of the series, while statement 2 only mentions that he wrote many episodes. However, this does not contradict the information in statement 1, as it is still true that Lindelof wrote many important episodes of the show."
