  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Lost? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Damon Lindelof was the screenwriter for Lost, while statement 2 claims that J.J. Abrams was the screenwriter for Lost. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, they are contradictory."
