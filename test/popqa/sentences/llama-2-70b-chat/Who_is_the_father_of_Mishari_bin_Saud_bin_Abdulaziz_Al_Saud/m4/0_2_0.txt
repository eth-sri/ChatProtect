They both provide the same answer to the prompt, which is that the father of Mishari bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is King Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"therefore\" in statement 1, which is unnecessary but does not change the meaning of the statement."
