  "explanation": "The statements about Jacopo Melani's occupation are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more detailed description of his occupation, including that he was a singer and violinist in addition to being a composer. Statement 2 simply states that he was a composer, which is also included in the first statement. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about Jacopo Melani's occupation."
