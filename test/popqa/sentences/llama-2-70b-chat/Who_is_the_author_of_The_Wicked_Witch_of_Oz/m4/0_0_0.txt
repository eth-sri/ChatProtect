  "explanation": "The statements about the author of The Wicked Witch of Oz are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that the character of the Wicked Witch was created by L. Frank Baum in his novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" while the second statement confirms that Baum is indeed the author of the book. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the authorship of the character and the book."
