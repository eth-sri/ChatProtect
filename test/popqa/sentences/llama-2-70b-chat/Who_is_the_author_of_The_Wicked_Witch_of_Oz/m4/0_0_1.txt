Frank Baum is the author of the novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" which features the character of the Wicked Witch of the West. The second statement clarifies that Baum specifically created this character. Therefore, both statements support the fact that L. Frank Baum is the author of The Wicked Witch of Oz."
