  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Mars?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 clarifies that Mars is not a work of fiction and therefore cannot be classified into any literary genre. Statement 2 simply states that Mars is a planet, which is a scientific fact and not related to any genre classification. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
