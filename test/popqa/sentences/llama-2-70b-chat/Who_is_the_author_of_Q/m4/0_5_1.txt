There are several theories about the authorship of Q, but no consensus has been reached. Some scholars believe that Q was written by a single author, while others propose that it was compiled from multiple sources by a editor or redactor.",

Statement 1 presents different theories about the authorship of Q, suggesting that some scholars believe it was written by a group of authors or editors, while others propose it was the work of a single individual. Statement 2 provides a possible timeframe for when Q was written, which does not contradict any of the theories presented in Statement 1. Both statements contribute to the ongoing scholarly debate about the authorship of Q."
