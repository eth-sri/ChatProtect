While both statements provide information about Q being a hypothetical source used by the authors of Matthew and Luke, statement 2 adds the detail that Q is believed to be an ancient Greek text. The authorship of Q is still unknown, regardless of whether it is a written text or an oral tradition. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
