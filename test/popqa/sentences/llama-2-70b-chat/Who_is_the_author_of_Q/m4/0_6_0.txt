  "alt": "Some scholars have proposed that the author of Q was a contemporary of Jesus, possibly a member of his inner circle or a disciple.",
  "prefix": " The authorship of the Q source is not definitively known and is the subject of ongoing scholarly debate. Q is a hypothetical source that is thought to have been used by the authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke in the composition of their works. It is believed that Q was a Greek-language text that contained a collection of sayings and teachings of Jesus, as well as some narrative material. There are several theories about the authorship of Q, but no consensus has been reached. Some scholars believe that Q was written by a single author, while others propose that it was compiled from multiple sources by a editor or redactor. Some have suggested that Q was written by a group of authors or editors working together, while others propose that it was the work of a single individual.",

Both statements acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding the authorship of Q and offer different theories to consider."
