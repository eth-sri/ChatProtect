  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of The Touch? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies Ingmar Bergman as the director of The Touch, while Statement 2 incorrectly identifies Martin Scorsese as the director. As there is only one director for a film, these two statements cannot both be true. Therefore, they are contradictory."
