Miracle music often features intricate vocal harmonies, with groups of singers singing in unison or in harmony with one another. The lyrics of Miracle songs typically focus on themes of faith, hope, and redemption, and are often inspired by biblical stories and teachings. Some notable artists in the Miracle genre include the Golden Gate Quartet, the Dixie Hummingbirds, and the Mills Brothers. The genre has had a significant influence on the development of other musical styles, including rhythm and blues, soul music, and rock and roll. Miracle music has been recognized for its cultural and historical significance, and has been celebrated through various festivals and events.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Miracle are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies the genre as a subgenre of gospel music, while also noting its cultural and historical significance. However, Statement 2 is incorrect in its assertion that Miracle has been documented in films such as \"The Blues Brothers\" and \"Apollo 13.\" These films do not feature Miracle music, but rather other genres such as blues and rock. Therefore, the two statements present conflicting information about the genre of Miracle."
