  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Aleph are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same definition of magical realism as a genre that blends realistic elements with magical or fantastical elements. The first statement simply uses this definition to categorize The Aleph within the genre, while the second statement provides a more general definition of the genre itself."
