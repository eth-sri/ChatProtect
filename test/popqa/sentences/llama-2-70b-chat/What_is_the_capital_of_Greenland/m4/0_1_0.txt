  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Greenland are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Nuuk is located on the southwest coast of Greenland, which is a factual statement. The first statement also adds that Nuuk is the country's largest city, which is an additional piece of information. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but rather provide different details about the same fact."
