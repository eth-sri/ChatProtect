Both statements confirm that Susanna Moore was the screenwriter for the film, but they differ in their explanation of the source material for the screenplay. Statement 1 states that the screenplay was based on Moore's novel of the same name, while Statement 2 simply states that the screenplay was based on the novel of the same name, also written by Susanna Moore. Both statements are true, but Statement 1 provides more specific information about the origin of the screenplay."
