  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Medium are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the screenwriter for The Medium is not publicly disclosed, while Statement 2 states that the film was directed by Samuel Tasina. However, the prompt specifically asks about the screenwriter, not the director. Therefore, the two statements do not provide consistent information about the screenwriter for The Medium."
