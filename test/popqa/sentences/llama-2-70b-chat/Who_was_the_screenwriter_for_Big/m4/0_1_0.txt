  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Big? are not contradictory. Both statements mention Anne Spielberg's involvement in the creation of the story or screenplay, but they differ in the level of collaboration between Ross and Spielberg. Statement 1 suggests that Ross and Spielberg worked together on the story, while Statement 2 implies that they collaborated on the screenplay itself. However, both statements ultimately confirm that Gary Ross was the screenwriter for the movie Big."
