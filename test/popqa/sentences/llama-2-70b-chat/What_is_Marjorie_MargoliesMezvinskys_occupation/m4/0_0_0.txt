  "explanation": "The statements about Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky's occupation are not contradictory, but they do provide different information. Statement 1 indicates that she used to work as a television reporter and anchor, while Statement 2 suggests that she currently works as a television producer. Therefore, the two statements are not in conflict with each other, but rather provide different perspectives on her career."
