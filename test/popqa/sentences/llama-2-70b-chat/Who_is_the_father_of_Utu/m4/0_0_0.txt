  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Utu are contradictory. Statement 2 identifies Shamash as Utu's father, while Statement 1 does not mention Shamash or any other specific god as Utu's father. Instead, it simply identifies Utu as a god in Polynesian mythology. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
