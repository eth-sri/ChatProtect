  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Cleftones are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different descriptions of the characteristics of doo-wop music. Both statements agree that doo-wop is characterized by harmonies and a simple musical structure, but statement 1 emphasizes the use of vocalizations and a cappella singing, while statement 2 emphasizes the smoothness of the vocal harmonies. Overall, both statements contribute to a fuller understanding of the doo-wop genre and its place in the history of R&B music."
