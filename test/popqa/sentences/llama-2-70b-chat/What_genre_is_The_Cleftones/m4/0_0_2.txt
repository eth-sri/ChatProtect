  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Cleftones are not contradictory. The first statement provides a broader context by identifying doo-wop as a subgenre of R&B music that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. The second statement narrows the focus to The Cleftones specifically, indicating that their music originated in the 1950s. Together, these statements provide complementary information about the genre and historical context of The Cleftones' music."
