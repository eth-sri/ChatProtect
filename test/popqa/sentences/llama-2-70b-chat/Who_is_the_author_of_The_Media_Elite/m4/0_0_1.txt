  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Media Elite? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies David T. Z. Mindich as the author of the book, while statement 2 incorrectly attributes the authorship to David Gelernter. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
