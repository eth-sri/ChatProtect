  "explanation": "The statements about what sport Toni Kuko\u010d plays are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for several teams, including the Chicago Bulls. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks as additional teams he played for, while statement 2 includes the Philadelphia 76ers instead. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the fact that Toni Kuko\u010d played professional basketball in the NBA."
