  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory. They both state that Firaq Gorakhpuri was a prominent figure in the Progressive Writers' Movement, which sought to promote social and political change through literature. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes the use of literature as a tool for social change, while statement 1 simply mentions the group's goal of promoting change. However, both statements agree that Gorakhpuri was involved in this movement and used his writing to address social and political issues."
