  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Counter-Strike are not contradictory. Both statements identify Counter-Strike as a first-person shooter game, but the first statement provides additional information by specifying that FPS is a subgenre of action video games. Therefore, the first statement is more specific and informative, while the second statement is more general."
