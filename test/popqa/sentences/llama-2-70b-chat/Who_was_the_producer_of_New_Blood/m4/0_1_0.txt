  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of New Blood are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the producer of the film is not explicitly stated, but it provides information about the company that produced the film. On the other hand, statement 2 explicitly states that the film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, it is unclear who the actual producer of the film is."
