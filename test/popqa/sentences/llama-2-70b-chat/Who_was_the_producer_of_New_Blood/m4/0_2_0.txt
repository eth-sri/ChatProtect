  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of New Blood? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the lack of explicit credit for the specific producer or producers of the film. Statement 1 notes that there is no credit for the producer or producers in the movie's credits or online sources, while Statement 2 specifies that there is no credit in the film's opening or closing credits. Together, these statements reinforce the idea that the producer or producers of New Blood are not explicitly identified."
