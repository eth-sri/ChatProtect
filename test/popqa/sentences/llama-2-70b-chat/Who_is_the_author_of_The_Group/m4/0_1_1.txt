  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Group? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the novel, but they do not contradict the fact that Mary McCarthy is the author of The Group. Statement 1 provides the year of publication and implies that the novel has stood the test of time to become a classic. Statement 2 simply reiterates that The Group is considered a classic of American literature."
