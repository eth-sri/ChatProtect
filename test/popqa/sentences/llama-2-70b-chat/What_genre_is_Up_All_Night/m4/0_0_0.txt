  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Up All Night are contradictory. The first statement describes the show as a comedy-drama, indicating that it contains elements of both comedy and drama. However, the second statement only identifies it as a comedy, suggesting that it does not have significant dramatic elements. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
