  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Up All Night are contradictory. The first statement categorizes it as a workplace comedy, while the second statement describes it as a show about three friends navigating their lives in New York City. While the workplace setting is a significant aspect of the show, it is not the only focus, and the relationships between the characters are also a central theme. Therefore, the show cannot be classified solely as a workplace comedy."
