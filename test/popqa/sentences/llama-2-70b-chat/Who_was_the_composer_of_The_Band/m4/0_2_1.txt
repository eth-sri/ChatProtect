  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of The Band are not contradictory. While Statement 2 specifically mentions that the band members shared songwriting duties, Statement 1 expands on this by stating that they were all multi-instrumentalists and vocalists who also shared lead vocal duties. This implies that the band members had a collaborative approach to creating music, with each member contributing their own ideas and skills to the songwriting process. Therefore, both statements support the idea that The Band was a group effort when it came to composing their music."
