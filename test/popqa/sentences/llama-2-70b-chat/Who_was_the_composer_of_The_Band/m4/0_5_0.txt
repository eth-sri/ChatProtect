Both statements agree that Robbie Robertson was the primary songwriter and lead guitarist of The Band. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions that he is often credited with being the leader of the group, while statement 2 does not mention this. However, this difference does not contradict the fact that Robertson was the composer of The Band's music."
