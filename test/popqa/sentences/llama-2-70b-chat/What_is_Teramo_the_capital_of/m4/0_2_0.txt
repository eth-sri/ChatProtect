  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Teramo the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about the location and borders of the province of Teramo, which is the capital of Teramo. The only difference is that statement 2 mentions the province of Chieti as being to the north of Teramo, while statement 1 mentions it as being to the east. However, this difference does not contradict the fact that Teramo is the capital of the province of Teramo."
