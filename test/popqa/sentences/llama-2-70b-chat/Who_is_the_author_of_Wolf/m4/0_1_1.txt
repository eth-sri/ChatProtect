  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Wolf? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the author is not explicitly stated in the text, while the second statement describes the style of writing in the story. The gender-based speculation in the first statement does not contradict the fact that the author's identity is not revealed in the text, and the second statement does not provide any information about the author's identity. Therefore, both statements can coexist without contradiction."
