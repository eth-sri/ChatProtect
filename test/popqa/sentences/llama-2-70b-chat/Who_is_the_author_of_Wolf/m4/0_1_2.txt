  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Wolf? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the author is not explicitly stated in the text, while the second statement provides additional information about the narrative style of the story. The gendered nature of the names \"Bar\" and \"Bat\" in statement 1 may suggest that the author's gender could be inferred based on the writing style, but this does not contradict the first statement."
