  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Dry? are contradictory because the text states that the director of Dry is Neill Blomkamp, while statement 2 suggests that the film was released in 2013, which is not consistent with Blomkamp's filmography as he did not direct a film called Dry in 2013. Statement 1, on the other hand, provides additional information about Blomkamp's career and his breakthrough film, District 9, which is relevant to the topic."
