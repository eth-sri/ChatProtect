  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of More? are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the composer of \"More\" was Riz Ortolani, an Italian composer and conductor who was active in the film industry from the 1950s to the 1980s. The only difference between the two statements is that the first one adds that Ortolani was also an arranger, while the second one does not mention this aspect of his career."
