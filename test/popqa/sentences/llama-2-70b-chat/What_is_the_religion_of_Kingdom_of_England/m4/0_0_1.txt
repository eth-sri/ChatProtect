  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Kingdom of England are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the established religion of the Kingdom of England was the Church of England, which was a form of Christianity. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that the official religion was Christianity, while statement 1 does not explicitly mention it. However, this does not contradict the information provided in statement 1."
