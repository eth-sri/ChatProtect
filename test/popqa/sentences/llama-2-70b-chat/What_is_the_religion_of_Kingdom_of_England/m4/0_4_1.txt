The Church of England is a part of the Anglican Communion, which is a worldwide body of churches that trace their origins to the Church of England.

  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of the Kingdom of England are not contradictory. They both refer to the hierarchical structure of the Church of England, with the monarch serving as its supreme governor. However, the second statement adds that the Archbishop of Canterbury is also the spiritual leader of the Church of England. Therefore, the second statement provides more detail about the Church of England's leadership structure."
