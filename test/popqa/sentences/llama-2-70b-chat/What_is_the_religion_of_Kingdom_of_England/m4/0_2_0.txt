  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the Church of England and its affiliation with the Anglican Communion. Statement 1 specifically mentions that the Anglican Communion is a worldwide body of churches that trace their origins to the Church of England, while Statement 2 simply states that the Church of England is a part of the Anglican Communion. Both statements support the fact that the Church of England is a distinct Christian denomination with a specific history and affiliation."
