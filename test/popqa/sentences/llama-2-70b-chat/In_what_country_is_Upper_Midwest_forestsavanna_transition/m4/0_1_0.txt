  "explanation": "The statements about the Upper Midwest forest-savanna transition are not contradictory. Both statements describe the same region and its characteristics, with the only difference being the use of the words \"mix\" and \"gradual transition.\" Both statements convey the idea that the region is a blend of forest and savanna ecosystems, with a zone of transition between them. The use of different words to describe the same concept does not create a contradiction."
