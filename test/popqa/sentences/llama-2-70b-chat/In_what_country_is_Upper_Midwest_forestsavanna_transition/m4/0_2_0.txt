  "explanation": "The statements about the Upper Midwest forest-savanna transition are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different factors that can affect the boundary between the two ecosystems. Statement 1 mentions vegetation composition as a factor, while statement 2 mentions temperature. However, both statements agree that soil type and moisture levels can also play a role in determining the exact boundary between the forest and savanna ecosystems in this region."
