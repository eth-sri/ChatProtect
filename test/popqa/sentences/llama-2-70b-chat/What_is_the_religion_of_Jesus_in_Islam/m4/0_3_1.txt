  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid).",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Islam considers Jesus a prophet and messenger of God who was blessed with miracles and wisdom. The first statement adds that Jesus' religion is Islam, while the second statement does not address his religion specifically. However, both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Jesus was a righteous servant of God who was sent to guide humanity towards submission to God's will."
