  "alt": "Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary.",
  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid).",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary, which is a fundamental belief in Islamic theology. The first statement goes on to explain that Jesus' religion is Islam and that he was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel, while the second statement simply affirms his miraculous birth. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
