  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Islam does not consider Jesus to be divine or the son of God, but rather a prophet and messenger of God. The first statement highlights the importance of the belief in the oneness of God in Islam, while the second statement emphasizes that Jesus was a human being. Together, these statements provide a clear understanding of the Islamic perspective on the religion of Jesus."
