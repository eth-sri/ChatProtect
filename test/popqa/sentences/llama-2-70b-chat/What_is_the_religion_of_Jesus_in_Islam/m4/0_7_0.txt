  "alt": "Jesus is not considered the son of God in Islam.",
  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid). Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and was blessed by God with miracles and wisdom. He is believed to have been sent to guide the Children of Israel, but they rejected him and plotted against him, leading to his eventual ascension to God. Islam also teaches that Jesus will return before the end of the world to bring peace and justice to the world, and his return is considered a sign of the approaching Day of Judgment. It's worth noting that while Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God, the beliefs and practices associated with him in Islam are different from those in Christianity.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Jesus is not considered the son of God in Islam and that his teachings are seen as a continuation of the message of previous prophets. The first statement expands on this by mentioning other prophets, while the second statement focuses solely on Jesus. Both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God, but not divine or the son of God."
