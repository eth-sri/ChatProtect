  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid). Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and was blessed by God with miracles and wisdom.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Jesus was sent to guide the Children of Israel, but the first statement adds that they rejected him and plotted against him, leading to his eventual ascension to God. The second statement simply reiterates that Jesus was sent to the Children of Israel without mentioning their rejection of him. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Jesus was a prophet sent by God to guide the Children of Israel."
