  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God in Islam, but he is not considered divine or the son of God. The second statement further elaborates on Jesus' role as a messenger sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and spread the message of submission to His will. Both statements are consistent with Islamic beliefs about Jesus and his religion."
