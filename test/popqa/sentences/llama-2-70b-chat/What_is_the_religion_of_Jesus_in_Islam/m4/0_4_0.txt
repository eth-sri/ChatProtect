  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid). Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and was blessed by God with miracles and wisdom.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and spread God's message of submission to His will, but they rejected him and plotted against him, leading to his eventual ascension to God. The second statement explains that Jesus was raised up to God and saved from crucifixion. Both statements are consistent with Islamic belief that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God, and that he was not crucified but rather raised up to God."
