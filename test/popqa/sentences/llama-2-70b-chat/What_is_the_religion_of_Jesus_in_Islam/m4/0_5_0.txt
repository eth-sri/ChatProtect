  "alt": "Jesus will return before the end of the world to bring peace and justice to the world.",
  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid). Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and was blessed by God with miracles and wisdom. He is believed to have been sent to guide the Children of Israel, but they rejected him and plotted against him, leading to his eventual ascension to God.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Islam teaches that Jesus will return before the end of the world to bring peace and justice to the world. The first statement provides additional information about the significance of Jesus' return as a sign of the approaching Day of Judgment, while the second statement simply reiterates the belief in Jesus' return."
