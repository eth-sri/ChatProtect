  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God in Islam, and that he was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel. The first statement adds that Jesus' religion is Islam, which means submission to God's will, while the second statement emphasizes his role as a guide for the Children of Israel. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the Islamic view of Jesus' religion and mission."
