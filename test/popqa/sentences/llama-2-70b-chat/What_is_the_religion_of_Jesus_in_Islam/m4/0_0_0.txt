  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Jesus is considered a prophet in Islam, but the first statement goes further to state that his religion is Islam. This means that Islam sees Jesus as a follower of the same religion that was revealed to other prophets before him, such as Abraham, Moses, and David. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and not contradictory."
