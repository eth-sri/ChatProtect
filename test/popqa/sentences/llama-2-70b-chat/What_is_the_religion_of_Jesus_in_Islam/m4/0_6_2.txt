  "orig": "It's worth noting that while Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God, the beliefs and practices associated with him in Islam are different from those in Christianity.",
  "alt": "Beliefs about Jesus are considered an important aspect of Islamic theology.",
  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of God, and his religion is Islam. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was sent by God to guide the Children of Israel and to spread God's message of submission to His will. Islam teaches that Jesus was a righteous servant of God, but he is not considered divine or the son of God, as this is seen as a departure from the central belief in the oneness of God (tawhid). Islam teaches that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary and was blessed by God with miracles and wisdom. He is believed to have been sent to guide the Children of Israel, but they rejected him and plotted against him, leading to his eventual ascension to God. Islam also teaches that Jesus will return before the end of the world to bring peace and justice to the world, and his return is considered a sign of the approaching Day of Judgment.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that there are differences between the Islamic and Christian beliefs about Jesus, while Statement 2 emphasizes the importance of Jesus in Islamic theology. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, but with distinct beliefs and practices associated with him."
