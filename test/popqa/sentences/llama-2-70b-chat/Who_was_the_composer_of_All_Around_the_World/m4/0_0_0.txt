  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"All Around the World\" are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that the song was written and produced by Rihanna, Stargate, and Rob Swire, while Statement 2 claims that Rihanna was the sole composer. \"Composer\" typically refers to the person who writes the music, so if the song was written by multiple people, it cannot be attributed solely to one composer. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
