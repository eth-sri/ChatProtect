  "explanation": "Statement 1 and Statement 2 are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that the composer of \"All Around the World\" is a collaborative effort between Rihanna, Stargate, and Rob Swire. On the other hand, Statement 2 claims that the composer of the song is Rihanna alone. \n\nWhile Rihanna did write and produce the song along with Stargate and Rob Swire, it is not accurate to say that she is the sole composer of the song. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
