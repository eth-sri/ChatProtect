The first statement suggests that the person is not aware of the movie \"Escape\" and therefore cannot answer the question about its screenwriter. However, the second statement contradicts the first by stating that the person is Alfred Hitchcock, who is a well-known director and producer but not the screenwriter for the movie \"Escape.\""
