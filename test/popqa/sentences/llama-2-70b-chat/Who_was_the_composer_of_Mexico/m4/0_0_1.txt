  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the composer of Mexico?\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that Mexico has had many composers throughout its history, making it difficult to identify a single composer as the \"composer of Mexico.\" The second statement provides information about a specific piece of music, the national anthem of Mexico, which is commonly attributed to Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez Bocanegra. While Bocanegra may be recognized for his contribution to Mexican music through the national anthem, it does not necessarily make him the sole composer of Mexico. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
