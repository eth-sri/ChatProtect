The first statement acknowledges that there have been many composers throughout Mexico's history and that it is impossible to identify a single composer as the \"composer of Mexico.\" The second statement provides a list of some of the most well-known Mexican composers, which is not in conflict with the first statement. It simply offers some examples of notable composers from Mexico."
