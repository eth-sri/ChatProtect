  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mexico? are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about Mexican composers, but do not contradict the idea that there is no single composer who can be identified as the \"composer of Mexico.\" The first statement mentions Ernesto Lecuona, who was a composer and pianist known for his contributions to Cuban and Mexican music. The second statement mentions Carlos Miguel Prieto, who is a contemporary composer, pianist, and conductor known for his advocacy of Mexican music and his work with the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico. Both statements add to the list of well-known Mexican composers, but do not contradict the idea that there is no single composer who can be identified as the \"composer of Mexico.\""
