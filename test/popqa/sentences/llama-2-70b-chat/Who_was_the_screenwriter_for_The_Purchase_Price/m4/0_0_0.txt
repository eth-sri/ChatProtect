  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Purchase Price are contradictory because they provide two different names. One statement claims that Sam Mintz was the screenwriter, while the other claims that Maurice V. Millard was the screenwriter. It is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
