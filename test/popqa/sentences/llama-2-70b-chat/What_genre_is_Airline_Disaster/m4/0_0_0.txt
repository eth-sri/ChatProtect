  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Airline Disaster? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Airline Disaster as a thriller film, which suggests that it is a fictional work intended to create suspense and excitement for the audience. On the other hand, Statement 2 describes Airline Disaster as a documentary series, which suggests that it is a non-fictional work intended to inform and educate the audience about real-life events. These two genres are fundamentally different in terms of their purpose, style, and content, and therefore cannot both apply to the same work."
