  "explanation": "The statements about \"Losing It\" are contradictory because they describe two different books. The first statement describes a book of essays about virginity and sexuality, while the second statement describes a coming-of-age novel about a young woman named Julia. Therefore, it is unclear which book the prompt is referring to and the statements cannot both be true for the same book."
