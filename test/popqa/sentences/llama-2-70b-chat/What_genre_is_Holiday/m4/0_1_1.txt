  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Holiday? are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the subgenre of Holiday music, specifically that it falls under the Pop music genre and lists some popular artists associated with it. Statement 2 is a simplified version of Statement 1, focusing on the same point that Mariah Carey and Michael Bubl\u00e9 are popular Holiday music artists. Both statements are consistent with the initial text that defines Holiday music as a genre characterized by festive and celebratory themes typically associated with the Christmas season."
