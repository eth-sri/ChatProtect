  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Holiday? are not necessarily contradictory, but they do present different perspectives on the genre. Statement 1 suggests that Holiday is a broader genre that encompasses music with festive and celebratory themes, while Statement 2 narrows the focus to jazz and swing music specifically. It is possible for Holiday to include jazz and swing music as well as other styles that fit the festive and celebratory theme. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather offer different interpretations of the genre."
