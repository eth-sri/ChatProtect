  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Warning are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the song was released in 2002 as the lead single from their seventh studio album, \"American Idiot,\" while Statement 2 states that the song was released in 2000 on Green Day's album \"Warning.\" This discrepancy in the release date of the song creates confusion about which album the song belongs to and therefore, the genre classification of the song."
