  "explanation": "The statements about the themes addressed in Warning do not contradict each other, but they are not directly related to the genre classification of the song. The first statement mentions the search for meaning in a post-9/11 world, while the second statement focuses on rebellion against societal norms. Both statements are valid interpretations of the song's lyrics, but they do not contradict the fact that Warning is generally classified as punk rock or pop punk."
