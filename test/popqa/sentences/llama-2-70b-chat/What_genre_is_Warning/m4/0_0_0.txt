  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Warning? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 identifies Warning as a punk rock or pop punk song, while Statement 2 identifies it as a thrash metal album. These are two distinct and separate genres of music, with different musical characteristics and influences. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
