  "explanation": "The statements about Lou Christie's genre are contradictory as one classifies his music as blue-eyed soul, a subgenre of soul music, while the other classifies it as pop rock. While there may be some overlap between the two genres, they are distinct and have different characteristics. Therefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
