  "explanation": "The statements about the father of Isis are not necessarily contradictory, but rather present two different theories. Statement 1 suggests that Osiris is the father of Isis, while statement 2 suggests that Geb is the father. It is possible that both theories could be true, as the ancient Egyptian gods often had multiple roles and associations. However, without further evidence or consensus among scholars, it is difficult to definitively determine who the father of Isis is."
