  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Isis are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that the god Osiris is a likely candidate for being the father of Isis. Statement 1 presents a theory that Osiris is both Isis's husband and father, while Statement 2 simply identifies Osiris as a common belief for being Isis's father. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Osiris is a possible father figure for Isis."
