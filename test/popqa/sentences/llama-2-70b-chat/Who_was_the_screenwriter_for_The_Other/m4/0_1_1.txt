  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Other are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar was the sole screenwriter for the film, while also serving as its director. The second statement adds that Amen\u00e1bar collaborated with Mateo Gil in writing the screenplay. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the screenwriting process for The Other."
