  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Other are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar both wrote and directed the film, while Statement 2 suggests that the screenplay itself was directed by Amen\u00e1bar. Since a screenplay cannot be directed, these two statements cannot both be true."
