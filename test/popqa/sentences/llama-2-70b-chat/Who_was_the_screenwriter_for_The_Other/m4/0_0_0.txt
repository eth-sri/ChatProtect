  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Other? are contradictory. The first statement claims that Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar was the screenwriter for the 2001 film \"The Others,\" while the second statement claims that Thomas Tryon was the screenwriter for \"The Other.\" The difference in the title of the film and the name of the screenwriter suggests that these are two different movies, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
