  "prefix": " The mother of Cassandra Cain is inconclusive in the DC Comics universe. There is no definitive answer to who her mother is, as her origin story has been revamped and retconned multiple times over the years. In some versions, Cassandra's mother is shown to be a woman named Sandra Wu-San, who was a skilled martial artist and assassin. However, this origin story has been largely retconned and is no longer considered part of Cassandra's official backstory. In other versions, Cassandra's mother is either unnamed or unrevealed.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement acknowledges that Cassandra's mother is rarely mentioned or explored, it does not provide any information about her mother's involvement in her training. The second statement suggests that Cassandra's mother did play a role in her martial arts training, but does not provide any information about her identity. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
