  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Cassandra Cain's origin story has been retconned multiple times, with different versions of her mother's identity being presented. The first statement specifically mentions that the version where her mother is Sandra Wu-San is no longer considered part of her official backstory, while the second statement notes that this version has been replaced with new versions. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Cassandra Cain's mother is not definitively established in the DC Comics universe."
