  "target": "Who is the mother of Cassandra Cain?",
  "orig": "Her father, David Cain, is often portrayed as a solitary figure who trained her in martial arts and weapons from a young age, but her mother's identity is rarely mentioned or explored.",
  "alt": "Her mother is often portrayed as a mysterious figure, with little information revealed about her past or motivations.",
  "prefix": " The mother of Cassandra Cain is inconclusive in the DC Comics universe. There is no definitive answer to who her mother is, as her origin story has been revamped and retconned multiple times over the years. In some versions, Cassandra's mother is shown to be a woman named Sandra Wu-San, who was a skilled martial artist and assassin. However, this origin story has been largely retconned and is no longer considered part of Cassandra's official backstory. In other versions, Cassandra's mother is either unnamed or unrevealed.",

While statement 1 acknowledges that Cassandra's mother is rarely mentioned or explored, it does not provide any definitive information about her identity. Statement 2 further emphasizes the mystery surrounding Cassandra's mother, which is consistent with the lack of a definitive answer in the DC Comics universe."
