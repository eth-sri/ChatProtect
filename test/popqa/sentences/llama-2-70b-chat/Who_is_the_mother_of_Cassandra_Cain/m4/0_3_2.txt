  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement mentions that Sandra Wu-San was previously portrayed as Cassandra's mother in some versions of her origin story, it also acknowledges that this has been retconned and is no longer considered part of her official backstory. The second statement reinforces this by explicitly stating that the origin story is no longer considered canon in the DC Comics universe. Therefore, both statements are consistent in conveying that the identity of Cassandra Cain's mother remains inconclusive."
