  "explanation": "The statements about who the mother of Cassandra Cain is are contradictory because they provide different names for her mother. In one version, her mother is named Sandra Wu-San, while in another version, her mother is named Lois Lane. Therefore, it is unclear which version is the correct one, and the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
