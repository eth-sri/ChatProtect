There is no definitive answer to who her mother is, as her origin story has been revamped and retconned multiple times over the years. In some versions, Cassandra's mother is shown to be a woman named Sandra Wu-San, who was a skilled martial artist and assassin. However, this origin story has been largely retconned and is no longer considered part of Cassandra's official backstory. In other versions, Cassandra's mother is either unnamed or unrevealed.",
