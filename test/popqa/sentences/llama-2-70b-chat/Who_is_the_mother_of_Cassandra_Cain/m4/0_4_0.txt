  "prefix": " The mother of Cassandra Cain is inconclusive in the DC Comics universe. There is no definitive answer to who her mother is, as her origin story has been revamped and retconned multiple times over the years. In some versions, Cassandra's mother is shown to be a woman named Sandra Wu-San, who was a skilled martial artist and assassin. However, this origin story has been largely retconned and is no longer considered part of Cassandra's official backstory.",

  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Cassandra Cain are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there is no definitive answer to who her mother is, and that her origin story has been revised and retconned multiple times. Statement 1 simply adds that in some versions, her mother is unnamed or unrevealed, while Statement 2 emphasizes that her mother's identity is currently unknown. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Cassandra Cain's origin story is complex and has undergone multiple revisions."
