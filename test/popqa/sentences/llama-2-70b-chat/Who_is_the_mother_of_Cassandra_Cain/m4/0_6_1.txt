  "prefix": " The mother of Cassandra Cain is inconclusive in the DC Comics universe. There is no definitive answer to who her mother is, as her origin story has been revamped and retconned multiple times over the years. In some versions, Cassandra's mother is shown to be a woman named Sandra Wu-San, who was a skilled martial artist and assassin. However, this origin story has been largely retconned and is no longer considered part of Cassandra's official backstory. In other versions, Cassandra's mother is either unnamed or unrevealed. Her father, David Cain, is often portrayed as a solitary figure who trained her in martial arts and weapons from a young age, but her mother's identity is rarely mentioned or explored.",

Both statements emphasize the fact that Cassandra Cain's origin story has been subject to multiple revisions and retcons over the years, which has resulted in an inconclusive answer to who her mother is in the DC Comics universe. The first statement provides a more detailed explanation of the different versions of her origin story, while the second statement is a more concise summary of the same idea."
