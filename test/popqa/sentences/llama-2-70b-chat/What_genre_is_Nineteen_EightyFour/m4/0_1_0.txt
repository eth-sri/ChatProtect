  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of Nineteen Eighty-Four are contradictory. Statement 1 classifies the novel as a political novel, a dystopian novel, and a work of science fiction, while statement 2 only classifies it as science fiction. Therefore, statement 2 is a subset of statement 1, and the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
