  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Nineteen Eighty-Four are not contradictory. Both statements identify the novel as belonging to the dystopian genre, which is characterized by a society that is oppressive, dehumanizing, and often totalitarian. The first statement provides additional information about the author and the title of the novel, while the second statement emphasizes the genre classification. Therefore, the statements are complementary and not contradictory."
