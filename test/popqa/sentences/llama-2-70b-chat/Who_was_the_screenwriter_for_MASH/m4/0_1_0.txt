  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for MASH? are not contradictory. Both statements mention Ring Lardner Jr. as the screenwriter for MASH and also mention his other notable screenplays. The only difference is that statement 1 includes Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) as one of Lardner's notable screenplays, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the fact that Lardner was the screenwriter for MASH."
