  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Egyptian? are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about Philip Dunne's notable works as a screenwriter, including The Robe, Demetrius and the Gladiators, and The Agony and the Ecstasy. The only difference is that statement 2 includes quotation marks around the titles of the films, which is a matter of style rather than substance."
