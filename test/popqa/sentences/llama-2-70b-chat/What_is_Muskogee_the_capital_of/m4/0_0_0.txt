  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Muskogee the capital of?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Muskogee is the capital of the Muscogee Nation, which is a federally recognized tribe in the United States. However, Statement 2 claims that Muskogee is the capital of Oklahoma. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as the Muscogee Nation is a sovereign entity with its own capital, government, and laws, separate from the state of Oklahoma. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other."
