  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Muskogee the capital of?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Muskogee is the capital of the Muscogee Nation, which is a federally recognized tribe in the United States. This implies that Muskogee is not the capital of any state or country.\n\nHowever, Statement 2 claims that the capital of Oklahoma is Muskogee. This implies that Muskogee is the capital of a state in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, and they contradict each other."
