  "prefix": " The author of Messiah is George Frideric Handel. Handel was a German-born British composer who lived from 1685 to 1759. He composed Messiah in 1741, and it is considered one of his most famous and enduring works. The libretto, or text, was written by Charles Jennens, who drew on biblical sources, particularly the Book of Isaiah, to create the narrative.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Messiah? are not contradictory. While the first statement focuses on the musical aspects of the oratorio and its famous \"Hallelujah\" chorus, the second statement provides a broader overview of the narrative content of Messiah, which does indeed cover the life of Jesus Christ. Both statements are accurate and complement each other in providing a fuller understanding of the work."
