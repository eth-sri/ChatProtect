  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Ross O'Carroll-Kelly? are contradictory. The first statement states that the character first appeared in a series of columns in the Irish Independent newspaper, while the second statement claims that the character first appeared in a series of columns in the Irish Times newspaper in the late 1990s. These two statements cannot both be true, as they present different origins for the character."
