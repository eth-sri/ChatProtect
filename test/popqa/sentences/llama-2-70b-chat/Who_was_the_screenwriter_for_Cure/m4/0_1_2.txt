The first statement acknowledges that the screenwriter is not explicitly stated, while the second statement suggests a possibility that the director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, may have also written the screenplay. The second statement also provides additional information about the screenwriter's work, mentioning another critically acclaimed film, \"Memento,\" which was written by Kurosawa. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
