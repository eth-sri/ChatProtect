  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that the EEC did not have a capital in the traditional sense, while the second statement provides information about where the EEC was established. The question \"What is the capital of European Economic Community?\" implies that the EEC had a capital, but the first statement corrects this assumption. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
