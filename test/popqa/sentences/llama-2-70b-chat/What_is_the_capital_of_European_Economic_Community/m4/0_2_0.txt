  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements explain that the European Economic Community did not have a capital city in the traditional sense, as it was not a country or a sovereign state. Statement 1 simply reiterates this fact, while Statement 2 provides further explanation by emphasizing that the EEC was not a formal entity with a capital. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that the EEC did not have a capital city."
