  "prefix": " The European Economic Community (EEC) was a predecessor to the European Union (EU) and did not have a capital in the classical sense. The EEC was a supranational organization that was established in 1958 and operated until 1993, when it was replaced by the European Union. During its existence, the EEC did not have a single capital city. Instead, it had three official seats of government: Brussels, Belgium (the administrative center), Strasbourg, France (the official seat of the European Parliament), and Luxembourg (the location of the European Court of Justice).",

  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same idea that the European Economic Community did not have a single capital city. Statement 1 emphasizes the absence of a single capital, while Statement 2 specifies that there was no capital city. Both statements are true and complement each other in providing a clear understanding of the absence of a capital city in the European Economic Community."
