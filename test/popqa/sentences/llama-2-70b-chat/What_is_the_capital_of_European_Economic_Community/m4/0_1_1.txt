The text provides background information about the EEC and its lack of a capital, while statement 1 explains the timeline of the EEC's existence and its eventual replacement by the EU. Statement 2 provides additional information about the establishment of the EEC through the Treaty of Rome. None of these statements directly address the question of the capital of the EEC."
