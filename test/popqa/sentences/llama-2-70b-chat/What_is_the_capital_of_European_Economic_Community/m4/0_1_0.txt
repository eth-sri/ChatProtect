  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the prompt asks for the capital of the European Economic Community, the text explains that the EEC did not have a capital in the classical sense. Statement 1 provides additional information about the EEC, including its establishment and replacement by the EU. Statement 2 further emphasizes the fact that the EEC was a supranational organization that spanned multiple countries. Neither statement directly addresses the prompt, but they do provide relevant information about the EEC."
