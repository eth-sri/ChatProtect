The first statement refers to Aaron Allston, a science fiction and fantasy author who used the pen name \"The Rev\" for some of his works. The second statement refers to Jonathan Davis, a musician and lead vocalist of the band Korn, who is also known by the nickname \"The Rev.\" Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory, but rather describe two different people with the same nickname."
