  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Wish You Were Here are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the song was composed by David Gilmour and Roger Waters. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence. Statement 1 mentions the composer as David Gilmour and Roger Waters, while Statement 2 directly states that the song was composed by them. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
