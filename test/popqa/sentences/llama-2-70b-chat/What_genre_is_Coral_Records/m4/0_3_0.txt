  "explanation": "The statements about Coral Records are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the label's history and the fate of its artists. Statement 1 explains that the label was discontinued in the early 1960s, while Statement 2 specifies that its artists were moved to the main Columbia label during that time. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Coral Records was a subsidiary label of Columbia Records that operated for a limited time before being absorbed into the parent company."
