  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Coral Records are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Coral Records was founded in 1956 and released recordings in various genres, while Statement 2 states that Coral Records was founded in 1949. Since the founding year is different in both statements, it is unclear which one is accurate, and this creates a contradiction."
