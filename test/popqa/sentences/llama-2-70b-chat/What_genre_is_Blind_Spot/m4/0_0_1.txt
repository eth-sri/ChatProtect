  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Blind Spot are contradictory. The first statement describes Blind Spot as a rock band formed in 1993 in Sweden, while the second statement contradicts this by stating that Blind Spot was formed in 2003 without specifying a genre. Therefore, it is unclear what genre Blind Spot belongs to based on these two statements."
