Statement 1 provides a general overview of the band's music style and mentions some of their albums, while Statement 2 provides a more detailed list of their studio albums. Both statements agree that Blind Spot's music is a mix of hard rock, heavy metal, and punk, and that they are associated with alternative rock and grunge. The only difference is that Statement 2 provides a more comprehensive list of their albums, including their debut album \"Blind Spot\" in 1993, which is not mentioned in Statement 1."
