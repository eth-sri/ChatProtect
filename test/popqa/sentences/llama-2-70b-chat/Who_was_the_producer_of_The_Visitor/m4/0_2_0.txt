The first statement clarifies that the producer is not explicitly stated, while the second and first statements provide additional information about the production company behind the film. The second statement specifies that McCarthy's partner was Jeff Skoll, while the first statement lists Scott Rudin and Ted Hope as co-founders of the production company. Both statements provide complementary information about the production company, but neither contradicts the other."
