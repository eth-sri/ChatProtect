  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Capture are contradictory. The first statement identifies the genre as a psychological thriller, which typically involves suspenseful and intense psychological situations. The second statement identifies the genre as science fiction, which typically involves futuristic or imaginary concepts and technologies. These two genres have distinct characteristics and themes, making it unlikely for a work to belong to both genres simultaneously. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
