Both statements confirm that Michael Brandt was the screenwriter for the film, and that he co-wrote the screenplay with Derek Haas. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about their collaboration on other projects, while statement 2 simply states that they co-wrote the screenplay for The Double."
