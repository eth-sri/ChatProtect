  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Mother are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the film incorporates elements of allegory, but statement 1 adds that it also includes surrealism and psychological thriller, while statement 2 adds symbolism. These are not mutually exclusive and can coexist within the same film. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genre of Mother."
