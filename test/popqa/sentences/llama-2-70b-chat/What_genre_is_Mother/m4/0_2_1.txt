Statement 1 expands on the different genres that the film incorporates, including allegory, surrealism, and psychological thriller, while Statement 2 focuses on the inclusion of allegory and surrealism specifically. Both statements acknowledge the psychological horror and body horror genres as the primary genres of the film, but Statement 1 provides more detail on the additional genres that are present."
