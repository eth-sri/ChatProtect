  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Bingo? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the director of the movie \"Bingo\" is not explicitly stated and lists several possible directors, including Hugh Wilson, John Blanchard, Doug Metzger, and Paul Weiland. Statement 2, on the other hand, explicitly states that one of these individuals, Robert D. Armstrong, was the director of the movie. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
