  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Faunus are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about the god Pan, who is Faunus' father in Roman mythology. Statement 1 describes Pan's associations with sexuality and fertility, while Statement 2 describes his behavior as wild and lascivious. Both statements are consistent with the characterization of Pan in mythology and do not contradict the fact that he is Faunus' father."
