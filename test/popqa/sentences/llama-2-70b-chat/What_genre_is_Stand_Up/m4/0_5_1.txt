Stand-up comedy is a popular form of entertainment and has been around for many decades, with many well-known comedians such as Richard Pryor, George Carlin, and Eddie Murphy getting their start in stand-up before moving on to other forms of media. Stand-up comedy can be classified as a form of comedy, but it can also be considered a form of performance art or storytelling. It is often distinguished from other forms of comedy, such as sketch comedy or improvisational comedy, by its focus on a single performer and their ability to engage with the audience directly.",
