  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of stand-up comedy are not contradictory. Statement 1 highlights the popularity and longevity of stand-up comedy as a genre, while also mentioning some famous comedians who started their careers in stand-up. Statement 2 expands on this idea by emphasizing the role of smaller venues in the development of stand-up comedians, and how many of them eventually transitioned to larger stages and media platforms. Both statements provide complementary information about the history and evolution of stand-up comedy as a genre."
