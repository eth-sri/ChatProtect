  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Our Lady of the Flowers are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the novel, including the year it was written and its significance as one of Genet's most famous works. Statement 2 simply confirms that the work in question is a novel. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Jean Genet is the author of Our Lady of the Flowers."
