  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Our Lady of the Flowers? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that the author of the novel is Jean Genet and that it was written in 1942. However, statement 2 is incorrect in stating that the novel was written in 1943. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
