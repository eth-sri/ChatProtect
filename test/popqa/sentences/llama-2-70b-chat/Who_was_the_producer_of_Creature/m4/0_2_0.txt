Both statements mention William Alland as the producer of the film and highlight his work on other horror and science fiction films. The only difference is that statement 1 includes \"The Wolf Man\" (1948) while statement 2 includes \"The Mummy's Curse\" instead. However, this does not contradict the fact that Alland produced \"Creature from the Black Lagoon.\""
