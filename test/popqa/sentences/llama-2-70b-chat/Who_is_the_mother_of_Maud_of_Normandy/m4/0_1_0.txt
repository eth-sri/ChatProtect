  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Maud of Normandy are not contradictory. Both statements identify Matilda of Scotland as the mother of Maud of Normandy and also mention that she was the wife of Henry I of England. The only difference between the two statements is that statement 1 provides additional information about Matilda of Scotland's role as the Queen Consort of England."
