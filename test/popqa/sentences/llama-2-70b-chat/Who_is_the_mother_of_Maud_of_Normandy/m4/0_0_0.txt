  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who is the mother of Maud of Normandy are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that Maud of Normandy's mother was Matilda of Scotland, while statement 2 claims that her mother was Empress Matilda. These are two different individuals, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true. It is unclear which statement is accurate without further information or clarification."
