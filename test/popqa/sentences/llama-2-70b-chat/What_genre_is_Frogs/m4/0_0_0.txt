  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Frogs? are contradictory. The first statement describes Frogs as a comedy play written by Aristophanes, while the second statement describes it as a rhythm and blues band. These two genres are completely different and cannot be applied to the same work. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
