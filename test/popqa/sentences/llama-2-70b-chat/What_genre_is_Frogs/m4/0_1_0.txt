  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Frogs are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Frogs is a comedy play written by Aristophanes in ancient Greece, and that it is a satire. The only difference is that statement 2 adds that it is considered a classic of ancient Greek literature. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about the play's significance."
