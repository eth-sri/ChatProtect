  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Nancy the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements are true and provide different levels of specificity. Statement 1 identifies Nancy as the capital of the Grand Est region, which includes several departments, including Lorraine. Statement 2 specifies that Nancy is also the capital of Lorraine, which is a historical region in northeastern France. Therefore, both statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
