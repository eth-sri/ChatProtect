  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of theatre are not contradictory. Both statements describe drama as a serious and often tragic form of theatre that focuses on character development and the emotional and psychological struggles of the characters. The only difference is in the wording used to describe the focus of drama. Statement 2 emphasizes the emotional and psychological struggles of the characters, while Statement 1 emphasizes character development and storytelling. However, both statements ultimately describe the same genre of theatre."
