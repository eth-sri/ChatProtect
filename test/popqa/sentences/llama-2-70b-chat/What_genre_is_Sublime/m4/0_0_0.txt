  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Sublime are not contradictory, but rather complementary. The first statement acknowledges the complexity of Sublime's sound and the difficulty in categorizing them into a single genre. The second statement provides a specific genre label, ska punk, that can be used to describe Sublime's music. Therefore, both statements contribute to a more complete understanding of the genre of Sublime."
