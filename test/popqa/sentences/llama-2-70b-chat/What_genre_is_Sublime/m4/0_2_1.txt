  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Sublime are not contradictory. While statement 1 acknowledges that the band is often categorized as ska punk, it also recognizes that their sound is diverse and has evolved over time. Statement 2 further emphasizes this evolution and the blending of different influences to create a unique and eclectic sound. Both statements ultimately support the idea that Sublime cannot be easily categorized into a single genre."
