  "explanation": "The two statements about the genre of Sublime are not contradictory. In fact, they complement each other. The first statement establishes that Sublime is a band that defies easy categorization, while the second statement elaborates on this by identifying the various genres that the band incorporates into their music. Together, these statements suggest that Sublime's genre is a complex and multifaceted blend of different styles, rather than a straightforward classification."
