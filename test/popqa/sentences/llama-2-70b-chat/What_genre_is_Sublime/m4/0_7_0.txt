  "prefix": " Sublime is a band that is difficult to pin down to a single genre. Their music incorporates elements of various styles, including ska, punk, reggae, hip hop, and rock. They are often categorized as a ska punk band, but their sound is diverse and has evolved over time. The band's early work was heavily influenced by the Southern California ska scene, and their debut album, \"40oz. to Freedom,\" released in 1992, is often characterized as a ska album. However, their subsequent albums, such as \"Robbin' the Hood\" (1994) and \"Self-Titled\" (1996), saw the band expanding their sound to incorporate elements of punk, alternative, and even acoustic music. The band's lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell, was known for his eclectic musical tastes and his ability to blend different styles into his songwriting.",

  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Sublime? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge the difficulty in categorizing Sublime's music due to its incorporation of various styles and genres. The first statement highlights the band's diverse sound and the different genres they have been categorized as, while the second statement emphasizes their multigenre approach and willingness to experiment with different styles. Both statements ultimately support the idea that Sublime's music cannot be easily classified into a single genre."
