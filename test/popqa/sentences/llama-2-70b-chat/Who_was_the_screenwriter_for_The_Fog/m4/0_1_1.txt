  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Fog? are not contradictory. The first statement provides the information that John Carpenter and Debra Hill were the screenwriters for the film, while also mentioning that Carpenter directed the film and that it stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, and Adrienne Barbeau. The second statement simply reiterates the fact that these three actresses starred in the film. Both statements are consistent with the fact that John Carpenter and Debra Hill were the screenwriters for The Fog."
