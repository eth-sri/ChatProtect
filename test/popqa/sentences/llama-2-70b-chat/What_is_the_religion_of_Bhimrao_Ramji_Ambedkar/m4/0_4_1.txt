He was born in a Maharashtrian Dalit family and was raised in a Hindu tradition. However, he was critical of Hinduism and its caste system, and he eventually embraced Buddhism. In 1956, Ambedkar converted to Buddhism, along with many of his followers, as a way to escape the discrimination and inequality faced by lower castes in Hinduism.",
