  "prefix": " Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was a Indian polymath and social reformer who played a significant role in the drafting of India's constitution and the fight against social injustice against the lower castes. He was born in a Maharashtrian Dalit family and was raised in a Hindu tradition. However, he was critical of Hinduism and its caste system, and he eventually embraced Buddhism. In 1956, Ambedkar converted to Buddhism, along with many of his followers, as a way to escape the discrimination and inequality faced by lower castes in Hinduism. He believed that Buddhism offered a more egalitarian and rational approach to religion and society, and he saw it as a way to challenge the caste system and promote social justice. Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism was a significant event in Indian history and had a profound impact on the social and political landscape of the country. It marked a turning point in the struggle for civil rights and social justice, and it paved the way for the empowerment of marginalized communities.",
