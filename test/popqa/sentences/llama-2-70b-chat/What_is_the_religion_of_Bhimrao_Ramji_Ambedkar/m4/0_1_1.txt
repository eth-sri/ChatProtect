  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that he was raised in a Hindu tradition, which is true as he was born in a Hindu Dalit family. However, later in his life, he converted to Buddhism and became a prominent advocate for the religion. Therefore, the second statement that he was a Buddhist is also true."
