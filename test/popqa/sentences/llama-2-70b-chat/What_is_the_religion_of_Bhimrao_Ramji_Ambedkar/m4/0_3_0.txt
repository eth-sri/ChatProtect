  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar are not contradictory. They both state that Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in 1956, along with many of his followers, as a way to escape the discrimination and inequality faced by lower castes in Hinduism. The only difference is that statement 2 provides a specific number of followers who also converted to Buddhism with Ambedkar."
