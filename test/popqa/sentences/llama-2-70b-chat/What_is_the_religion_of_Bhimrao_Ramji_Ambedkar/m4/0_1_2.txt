  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar are not contradictory. While statement 1 mentions that he was raised in a Hindu tradition, statement 2 provides additional information about his family background and birth order. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Ambedkar was born into a Maharashtrian Dalit family, which is a historically marginalized community within the Hindu caste system. Therefore, it is possible for him to have been raised in a Hindu tradition while also being a Dalit and advocating for the rights of lower castes."
