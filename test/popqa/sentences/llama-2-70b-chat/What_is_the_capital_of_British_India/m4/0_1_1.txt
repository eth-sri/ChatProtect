  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement provides the historical context of New Delhi being established as the capital of British India in 1911 and remaining so until India gained independence in 1947. The second statement simply states that New Delhi continued to be the capital of India even after gaining independence from British rule in 1947. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional information about the history of New Delhi as the capital of India."
