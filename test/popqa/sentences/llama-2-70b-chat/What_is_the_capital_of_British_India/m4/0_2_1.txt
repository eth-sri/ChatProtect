  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of British India are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that New Delhi was the capital of British India from 1911 to 1947, while the second statement provides additional information that Calcutta was the capital prior to that, from 1707 to 1911. The second statement also adds that Calcutta was an important city during the colonial era, but this does not contradict the fact that New Delhi was the capital after 1911. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the history of the capital of British India."
