  "explanation": "The statements about James J. Gibson's occupation are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more detailed description of his occupation, including his roles as a researcher and theorist in addition to being a professor of psychology. Statement 2 simply states that his occupation was that of a professor of psychology, which is also true. Both statements are accurate and provide different levels of detail about his occupation."
