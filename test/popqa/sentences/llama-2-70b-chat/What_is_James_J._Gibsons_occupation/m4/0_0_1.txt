  "explanation": "The statements about James J. Gibson's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements identify him as a psychologist, with the first statement providing additional information about his contributions to the field of visual perception and the theory of affordances, as well as mentioning his background in theoretical meteorology. The second statement simply emphasizes his prominence within the field of psychology."
