  "explanation": "The statements about Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements agree that he was a French naturalist, but the first statement adds that he was also a soldier and philosopher. Therefore, the first statement provides more information about Lamarck's career, while the second statement only specifies his occupation as a naturalist."
