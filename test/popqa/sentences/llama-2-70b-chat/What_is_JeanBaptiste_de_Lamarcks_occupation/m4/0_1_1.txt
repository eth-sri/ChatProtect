  "explanation": "The statements about Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck's occupation are not contradictory. The first statement provides a brief overview of his various professions, including naturalist, soldier, and philosopher. The second statement elaborates on his contributions to the field of biology, specifically his theory of evolution, which was published in his book \"Philosophie Zoologique\" in 1809. Both statements are complementary and provide different aspects of Lamarck's career and achievements."
