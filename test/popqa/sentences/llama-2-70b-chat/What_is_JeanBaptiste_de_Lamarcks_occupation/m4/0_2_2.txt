  "explanation": "The statements about Lamarck's occupation do not contradict each other. While the text mentions that Lamarck was a naturalist, soldier, and philosopher, the two additional statements provide more specific information about his work as a naturalist and philosopher. Statement 1 highlights his most famous work, which was focused on evolutionary theory, while Statement 2 emphasizes the significance of that work in the development of modern evolutionary theory. Both statements are consistent with Lamarck being a naturalist and philosopher."
