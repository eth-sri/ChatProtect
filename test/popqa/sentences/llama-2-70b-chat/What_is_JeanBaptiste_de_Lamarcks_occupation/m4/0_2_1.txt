  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement highlights Lamarck's occupation as a naturalist, soldier, and philosopher, it also mentions his contributions to the field of biology and his famous work \"Philosophie Zoologique,\" which laid out his theory of evolution. The second statement simply reiterates the publication date of this famous work. Both statements are consistent with Lamarck's occupation as a naturalist and his contributions to the field of biology."
