  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Westminster the capital of?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that Westminster is a district in central London and the capital of the United Kingdom, while statement 2 incorrectly states that it is the capital of Scotland. The capital of Scotland is actually Edinburgh. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other."
