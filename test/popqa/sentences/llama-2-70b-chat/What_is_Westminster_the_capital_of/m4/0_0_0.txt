  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Westminster the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Westminster as the capital of the United Kingdom, while also providing additional information about its location as a district in central London. Statement 2 simply reiterates that Westminster is a district in London, which is also true. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
