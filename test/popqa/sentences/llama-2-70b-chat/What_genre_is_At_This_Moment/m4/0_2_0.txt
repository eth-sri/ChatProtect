  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"At This Moment\" are not contradictory. Both statements mention the soulful vocals and catchy melody of the song, which are characteristic of pop-soul or blue-eyed soul. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that the melody has a hint of retro influences, which does not contradict the genre classification.
