  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of \"At This Moment\" are not necessarily contradictory, but they do offer different perspectives on the song's genre. Statement 1 suggests that the song has elements of both pop and soul music, while Statement 2 simply categorizes it as pop music. It is possible for a song to fall under multiple genres, and the specific categorization may depend on the listener's interpretation and the criteria used to define genres. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory, but rather offer different ways of classifying the song's genre."
