He was known for his innovative production techniques, such as using multiple instruments and vocal tracks to create a fuller sound, and for his use of echo and reverb to create a sense of space and depth in his productions. Spector was also known for his distinctive \"Wall of Sound\" production style, which used multiple instruments and vocalists to create a dense, layered sound. Spector worked closely with Lennon on the production of \"Imagine,\" and the two men reportedly had a good working relationship. According to Lennon, Spector brought a sense of discipline and focus to the recording sessions, which helped to shape the album's sound and ensure that it was completed in a timely manner.",
