  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Naval the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that Naval is not a capital city of any country or territory. While statement 1 explicitly states that Naval is not the capital of any country or territory, statement 2 emphasizes that Naval is not a capital city in general. Therefore, both statements provide the same information and do not contradict each other."
