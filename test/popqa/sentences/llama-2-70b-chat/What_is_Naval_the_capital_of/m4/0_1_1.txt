  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Naval the capital of?\" are contradictory because they provide different information about the location of Naval. Statement 1 states that Naval is located in the state of Punjab, India, while Statement 2 states that it is located in the state of Maharashtra, India. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other."
