In sprint kayaking, athletes compete in a straight line over a set distance, typically 200m or 500m, in a single-person or multi-person boat. The \"K-4\" in the name refers to the fact that there are four paddlers in the boat.",

The only difference is that statement 1 includes both \"canoeing\" and \"kayaking\" in the name, while statement 2 only includes \"kayaking.\" However, both statements accurately describe the sport played in the women's K-4 500 metres event at the 2014 Asian Games."
