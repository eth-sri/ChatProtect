  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Levice District are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Levice as the capital of the district, while statement 2 incorrectly identifies Levico Terme, which is actually a town in Italy. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
