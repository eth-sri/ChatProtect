Statement 1 provides additional information about Samuel Bronston's life, but it does not contradict the fact that he was the producer of \"El Cid.\" Statement 2, on the other hand, provides a different piece of information about his birthplace, but it does not contradict the fact that he was the producer of \"El Cid.\" Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
