  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about Canberra, the capital of Australia, and specifically mention its cultural institutions/attractions. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 1 using the term \"institutions\" and statement 2 using the term \"attractions.\" However, both statements convey the same idea that Canberra is known for its cultural offerings."
