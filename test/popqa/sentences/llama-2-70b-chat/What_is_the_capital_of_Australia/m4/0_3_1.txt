  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Australia are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the city of Canberra, including its design by American architect Walter Burley Griffin. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the year of establishment (1908), while statement 2 provides a general time frame (early 20th century). However, both statements support the fact that Canberra was designed by Griffin and established as the capital of Australia."
