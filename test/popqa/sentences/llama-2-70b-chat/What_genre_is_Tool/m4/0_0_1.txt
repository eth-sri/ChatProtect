  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Tool are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements acknowledge that Tool incorporates elements of multiple genres, including alternative rock, heavy metal, progressive rock, and psychedelic rock. The second statement simply emphasizes the combination of alternative metal and progressive rock as the primary genres that define Tool's sound. Overall, both statements contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Tool's genre-defying music."
