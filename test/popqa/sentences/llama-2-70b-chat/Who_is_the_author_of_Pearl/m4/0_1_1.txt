  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Pearl are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a possible explanation for the author's identity, stating that it is believed to have been written by a cleric or a monk in the 14th century, while Statement 2 provides a possible timeframe for when the poem was written, stating that it is believed to have been written in the late 14th century. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the author of Pearl is an anonymous poet who wrote the Middle English poem in the 14th century."
