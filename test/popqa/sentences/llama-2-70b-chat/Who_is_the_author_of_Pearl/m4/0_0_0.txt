  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Pearl? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies the author of Pearl as an anonymous Middle English poet, while Statement 2 incorrectly attributes the authorship to John Steinbeck, who was a 20th-century American author and not alive during the Middle English period."
