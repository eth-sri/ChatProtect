  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Pearl are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the author of Pearl is anonymous. Statement 1 provides additional information about the poem, stating that it is a Middle English poem with 12 cantos. Statement 2 simply reiterates that the author is unknown. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
