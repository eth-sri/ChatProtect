  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Pearl are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that the author of Pearl was anonymous and lived in the 14th century. The first statement adds that the author was likely a cleric or a monk, while the second statement simply confirms the time period in which the author lived. Therefore, the statements are complementary and do not contradict each other."
