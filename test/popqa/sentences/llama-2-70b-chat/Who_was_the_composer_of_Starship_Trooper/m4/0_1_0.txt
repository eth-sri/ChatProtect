  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Starship Trooper\" are contradictory. The first statement states that Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, and Steve Howe, all members of Yes, composed the song. The second statement contradicts this by stating that the song was released in 1976 on the album \"Fragile,\" which was composed solely by Yes guitarist Steve Howe. Therefore, the second statement implies that Steve Howe was the sole composer of \"Starship Trooper,\" while the first statement suggests that it was a collaborative effort among multiple members of the band."
