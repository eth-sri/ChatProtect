  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Starship Trooper are not contradictory. Both statements identify Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, and Steve Howe as the composers of the song and members of the band Yes. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 first identifies the composers and then mentions their membership in Yes, while Statement 2 first mentions their membership in Yes and then identifies them as the composers of the song."
