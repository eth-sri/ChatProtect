  "explanation": "The statements about the authors of Left Behind are not contradictory. Both statements identify Tim LaHaye as a Christian minister and speaker, while the second statement simply omits mentioning Jerry B. Jenkins' profession as a journalist and author. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide accurate information about the authors of the Left Behind series."
