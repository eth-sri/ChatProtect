  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Left Behind? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins collaborated on the series, with LaHaye providing the overall vision and Jenkins doing the majority of the writing. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes the division of labor between the two authors, while statement 2 simply states that they collaborated on the writing."
