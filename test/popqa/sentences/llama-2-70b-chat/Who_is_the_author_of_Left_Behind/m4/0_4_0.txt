  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Left Behind? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the first book in the series, \"Left Behind,\" was published in 1995 and that the series was co-authored by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. The only difference is that statement 2 includes the subtitle \"A Thrilling New Adventure\" which is not included in statement 1. However, this does not contradict the information provided in either statement."
