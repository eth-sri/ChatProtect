Both statements provide additional information about the series, but they do not contradict the fact that Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins are the authors of the series. Statement 1 provides more detail about the content of the series and the authors' interpretation of biblical prophecy, while Statement 2 simply summarizes the focus of the series."
