  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Highway? are not contradictory. The first statement indicates that the author was unable to find any information on a movie called \"Highway,\" which suggests that the movie may not exist or may be relatively unknown. The second statement indicates that even if the movie does exist, the screenwriter's name is not publicly available, which means that it may be difficult or impossible to determine who wrote the screenplay for the film. Therefore, both statements suggest that there is no clear answer to the question of who was the screenwriter for Highway."
