  "explanation": "The statements about the history of Ghana are not necessarily contradictory, but they do present different timelines. Statement 1 suggests that Ghana's history dates back to the 7th century AD with the establishment of the Kingdom of Ghana, while Statement 2 suggests that it dates back to the 10th century. However, it is possible that both statements are true, as Ghana's history may have had significant developments and events during both time periods."
