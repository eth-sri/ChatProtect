  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Sun are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the editorial direction and tone of the newspaper are the result of a collaborative effort by the editorial team, while statement 2 suggests that the editor-in-chief has the final say in deciding the overall editorial direction and tone. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present different views on the decision-making process behind The Sun's content."
