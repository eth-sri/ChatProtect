  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Sun? are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about the ownership of The Sun, but do not contradict the fact that the newspaper's content is created by a team of journalists and editors. Statement 1 provides a broader context by mentioning that News Corp owns other media outlets, while Statement 2 specifically names Rupert Murdoch as the founder of News Corp."
