  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Forever Young? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies Bob Dylan as the composer of \"Forever Young\" and also provides the correct album on which it was released. However, Statement 2 is incorrect in stating that the song was released in 1975, when it was actually released in 1974. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other in terms of the year of release."
