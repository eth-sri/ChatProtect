  "explanation": "The statements about the author of \"More\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about Hannah More, the author of \"More\". The only difference is that statement 1 includes the additional detail that she was a philanthropist and provides her birth and death years, while statement 2 simply states that she was a playwright and poet and uses the term \"English\" instead of \"British\". However, both statements ultimately identify Hannah More as the author of \"More\"."
