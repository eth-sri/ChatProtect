  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Treasure Island? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that the producer of the film was Walt Disney Productions, which was the production company founded by Walt Disney and his brother Roy Disney. This implies that the production company was responsible for producing the film, not just Walt Disney himself.\n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 directly states that the producer of the film was Walt Disney, without mentioning the involvement of his production company. This implies that Walt Disney himself was solely responsible for producing the film.\n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, and are contradictory."
