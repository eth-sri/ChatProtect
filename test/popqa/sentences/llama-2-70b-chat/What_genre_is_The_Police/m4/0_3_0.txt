  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Police are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges the difficulty in categorizing the band's sound and style to a single genre, while also mentioning the commonly used labels of \"new wave\" and \"post-punk.\" Statement 2 adds to this by highlighting the band's incorporation of reggae elements, which has led to the label of \"white reggae.\" Both statements provide different perspectives on the band's genre, but they do not contradict each other."
