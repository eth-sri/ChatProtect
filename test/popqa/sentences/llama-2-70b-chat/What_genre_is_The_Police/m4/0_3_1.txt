  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is The Police? are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges the difficulty in categorizing the band's sound and style to a single genre, while also mentioning the commonly used labels of \"new wave\" and \"post-punk.\" Statement 2 adds to this by highlighting the band's incorporation of reggae elements, which has led to them being described as a \"white reggae\" band. Both statements provide different perspectives on the band's genre, without contradicting each other."
