  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Paul are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Paul's background and education as a Jewish Pharisee. The first statement highlights his initial opposition to Christianity, while the second statement emphasizes his education under a respected rabbi in Jerusalem. Together, these statements help to paint a more complete picture of Paul's religious upbringing and how it influenced his later conversion to Christianity."
