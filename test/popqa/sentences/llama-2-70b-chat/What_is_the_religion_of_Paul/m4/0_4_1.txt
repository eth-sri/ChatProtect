  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Paul are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Paul had a transformative experience while traveling to Damascus, where he encountered Jesus Christ. The first statement emphasizes the transformative nature of the experience, while the second statement emphasizes the result of the experience, which was Paul's conversion to Christianity and his subsequent role as a Christian apostle. Overall, both statements support the idea that Paul's religion changed from Judaism to Christianity after his encounter with Jesus Christ."
