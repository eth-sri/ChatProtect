  "explanation": "The statements about the author of \"Suicide\" are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about \u00c9mile Durkheim's arguments in the book. Statement 1 highlights Durkheim's argument that social integration can prevent suicide, while statement 2 emphasizes his belief that weak social bonds and cohesion contribute to higher suicide rates. Both statements support Durkheim's overall thesis that suicide is a social phenomenon influenced by cultural and societal factors."
