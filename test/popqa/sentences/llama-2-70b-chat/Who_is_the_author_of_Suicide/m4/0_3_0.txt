  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Suicide? are not contradictory. While the first statement focuses on Durkheim's exploration of suicide as a social phenomenon, the second statement expands on this by highlighting his examination of the various social and cultural factors that contribute to suicide rates. Both statements are complementary and provide a more comprehensive understanding of Durkheim's work on suicide."
