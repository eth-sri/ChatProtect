  "explanation": "The statements about the author of \"Suicide\" are not contradictory. The first statement provides information about \u00c9mile Durkheim as the author of the book and his contribution to the field of sociology. The second statement provides a key argument from the book, which is that suicide is influenced by social factors and occurs more frequently in societies with strong social cohesion. Both statements are complementary and provide different aspects of the book and its author."
