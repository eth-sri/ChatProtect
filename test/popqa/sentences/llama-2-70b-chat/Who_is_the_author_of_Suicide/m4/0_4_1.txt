  "prefix": " The author of \"Suicide\" is \u00c9mile Durkheim. Durkheim was a French sociologist who is considered one of the founders of the discipline of sociology. He wrote \"Suicide\" in 1897, and it is considered one of his most important works. In the book, Durkheim explores the phenomenon of suicide and argues that it is not just an individual act, but also a social one, influenced by the social and cultural context in which it occurs.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Suicide? are not contradictory. The first statement provides additional information about Durkheim's argument in the book, specifically about the relationship between suicide rates and societal factors such as individualism and capitalism. The second statement is a simplified version of the same idea, focusing solely on the correlation between individualism and suicide rates. Both statements are consistent with Durkheim's argument in \"Suicide.\""
