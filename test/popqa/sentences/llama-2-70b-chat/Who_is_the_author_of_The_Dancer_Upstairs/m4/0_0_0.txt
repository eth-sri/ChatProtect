  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Dancer Upstairs? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies Nicholas Shakespeare as the author of The Dancer Upstairs, while Statement 2 incorrectly identifies Nikolas Shakespeare as the author of Memorial. The misspelling of the author's first name and the mention of a different book altogether make Statement 2 irrelevant to the prompt and contradictory to Statement 1."
