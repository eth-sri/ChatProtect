  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Sprout are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same message that the author of Sprout is not widely known or recognized. The first statement implies that the author may not have published many works or gained significant recognition, while the second statement explicitly states that the author is not known. Therefore, both statements are consistent in their message that the author of Sprout is not a well-known figure."
