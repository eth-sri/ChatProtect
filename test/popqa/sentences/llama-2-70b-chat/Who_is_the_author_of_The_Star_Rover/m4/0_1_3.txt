  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Star Rover are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the novel, including its alternate title and the year it was published, while still confirming that Jack London is the author. Statement 2 simply reiterates the year of publication. Both statements support the fact that Jack London is the author of The Star Rover."
