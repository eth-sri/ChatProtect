  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Star Rover? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Jack London as the author of The Star Rover, while statement 2 incorrectly identifies Robert Bloch as the author. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
