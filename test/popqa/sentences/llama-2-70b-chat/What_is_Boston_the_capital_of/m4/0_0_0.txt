  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Boston the capital of?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Boston is not the capital of any state or country, while Statement 2 specifically states that Boston is not the capital of Massachusetts. However, Massachusetts is a state in the United States, which means that Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1. If Boston is not the capital of any state or country, then it cannot be the capital of Massachusetts, which is a state. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
