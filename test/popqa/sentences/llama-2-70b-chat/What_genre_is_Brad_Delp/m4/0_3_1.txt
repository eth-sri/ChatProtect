While the text focuses on Delp's work in the rock music genre, specifically in the subgenres of arena rock and pomp rock, the two additional statements mention his successful solo career and collaborations with other artists in various musical projects. This suggests that Delp's musical style was not limited to just one genre, but rather he had a diverse range of musical interests and collaborations."
