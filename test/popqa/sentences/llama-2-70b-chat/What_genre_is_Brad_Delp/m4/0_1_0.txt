While statement 1 provides additional information about Brad Delp's role in the band Boston, it does not contradict the initial statement that he was known for his work in the rock music genre, specifically in the subgenre of arena rock and pomp rock. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Brad Delp was primarily associated with rock music."
