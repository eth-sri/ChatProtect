  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who is the mother of Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte's grandmother was Hortense de Beauharnais, which means that his mother would have been one of Hortense's daughters. However, Statement 2 claims that Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte's mother was Marie-Jos\u00e8phe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie, who is not related to Hortense de Beauharnais. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
