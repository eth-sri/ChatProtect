  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte's mother was Hortense de Beauharnais, while statement 2 suggests that his mother was Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo, who was actually the wife of Napoleon III and not Pierre's biological mother. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
