  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Electronic are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the roots of Electronic music can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s when musicians began experimenting with electronic instruments and production techniques. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies the 1970s as the starting point, while statement 1 includes both the 1960s and 1970s. However, this difference in specificity does not contradict the overall agreement between the two statements."
