  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Electronic are not contradictory. Both statements agree that electronic music has its roots in the mid-20th century when musicians began experimenting with electronic instruments and production techniques. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies the 1960s and 1970s as the time period, while statement 2 is more general in its description. Overall, both statements support the idea that electronic music is a genre that emerged from the use of electronic equipment in music production."
