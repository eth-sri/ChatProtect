  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Electronic? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that electronic music is produced using electronic equipment, including synthesizers, drum machines, and computer software. The first statement provides a broader definition of electronic music, while the second statement is more specific about the equipment used in its production. However, both statements are consistent in their description of electronic music as a genre that relies heavily on electronic equipment."
