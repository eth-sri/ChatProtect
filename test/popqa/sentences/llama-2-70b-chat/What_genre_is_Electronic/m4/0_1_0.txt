  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Electronic? are not contradictory. Both statements define electronic music as music that uses electronic equipment or technology as a central element of its sound. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions synthesizers and drum machines as examples of electronic equipment, while statement 2 is more general in its definition. However, both statements agree that electronic music encompasses a wide range of styles and subgenres."
