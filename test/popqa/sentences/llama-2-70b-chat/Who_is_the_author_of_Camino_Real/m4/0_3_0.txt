  "explanation": "The statements about the play Camino Real are not contradictory. Both statements describe the play's unique style and use of literary techniques, but use slightly different terms to do so. The first statement mentions \"magic realism,\" while the second statement uses the term \"expressionistic style\" and mentions the blending of different genres. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that the play is known for its unconventional and imaginative approach to storytelling."
