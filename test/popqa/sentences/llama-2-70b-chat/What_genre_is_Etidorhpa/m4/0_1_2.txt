  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Etidorhpa are contradictory. The first statement describes it as a work of science fiction that explores themes of science and technology in a futuristic society, while the second statement suggests that it is a work of science fiction set in a world where humanity has already colonized other planets. These two descriptions do not align with each other, as one suggests a focus on the development of technology and society, while the other suggests a focus on space exploration and colonization. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
