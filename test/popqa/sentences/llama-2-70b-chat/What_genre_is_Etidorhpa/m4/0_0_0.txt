  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Etidorhpa are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Etidorhpa as a work of science fiction, which is a genre that typically involves imaginative and speculative elements related to science and technology. The second statement simply identifies Etidorhpa as a novel, which is a literary form that can encompass a wide range of genres, including science fiction. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about the nature of Etidorhpa."
