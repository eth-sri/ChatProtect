Statement 1 provides additional information about the change in the capital of Russia after the fall of the Russian Empire, while Statement 2 simply restates the fact that the capital was moved to Moscow in 1918. Both statements are consistent with the original text that states St. Petersburg was the capital of the Russian Empire until 1917."
