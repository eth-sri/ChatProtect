  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that the question \"Who was the director of Action?\" is nonsensical because \"Action\" is not a specific entity that can have a director. Statement 1 further explains that \"Action\" is not a proper noun, which reinforces the idea that it cannot have a director. Statement 2 emphasizes that \"Action\" is not a movie or a film, which is another reason why the question is invalid. Overall, both statements support the same idea that the question is not answerable."
