  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the director of Action?\" are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that \"Action\" is not a specific entity that can have a director, and that only proper nouns or specific entities such as movies or plays can have directors. Therefore, the question itself is nonsensical and cannot be answered. Statement 1 further emphasizes this point by stating that \"Action\" is not even a proper noun, making it even more impossible for it to have a director."
