  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of \"Regeneration\" are contradictory. Statement 1 identifies the novel as science fiction, while statement 2 identifies it as historical fiction. These are two distinct genres that do not overlap. Science fiction typically involves futuristic or speculative elements, while historical fiction is set in a specific historical period and focuses on realistic portrayals of events and characters from that time. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
