  "prefix": " The capital of the Tokugawa Shogunate was Edo (now known as Tokyo). The Tokugawa Shogunate was a feudal regime that ruled Japan from 1603 to 1867, and Edo was the seat of the shogunate's power and the residual city of the Tokugawa shoguns. The city was the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan during this time, and it was the largest city in the world during the 18th century.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Tokugawa Shogunate are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the city was renamed Tokyo in 1868 during the Meiji Restoration, while Statement 2 claims that the city was renamed Tokyo in 1863. Since the two statements provide different years for the renaming of the city, they cannot both be true."
