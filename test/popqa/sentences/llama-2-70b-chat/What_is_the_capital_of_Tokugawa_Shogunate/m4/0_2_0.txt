  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of the Tokugawa Shogunate are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Edo was the largest city in the world during the 18th century, but statement 1 also adds that it was the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan during that time. Therefore, statement 1 provides additional information about Edo's significance beyond its size, while statement 2 focuses solely on its size."
