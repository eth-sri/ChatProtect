  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Well? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that William Wyler was the director of The Well, while statement 2 claims that Mark Pellington was the director. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
