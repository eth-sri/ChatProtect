  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Circle are not contradictory. The first statement describes the film as a psychological thriller that explores themes related to technology and privacy, while the second statement highlights a key aspect of the film's plot, which is the public accessibility of personal information. Both statements are consistent with the idea that The Circle is a science fiction film that deals with the implications of a hyper-connected society."
