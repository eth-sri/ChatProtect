Both statements describe the film as exploring themes related to technology, privacy, and the consequences of living in a society where personal information is publicly accessible or everything is monitored and shared online. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically labels the film as a psychological thriller, while statement 2 does not provide a specific genre."
