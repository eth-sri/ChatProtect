  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Circle are not contradictory. While the film has elements of science fiction, such as its portrayal of a near-future world where technology has taken over every aspect of life, it is primarily a drama that explores themes of privacy, surveillance, and the dangers of unchecked power. Therefore, both statements are accurate and complementary in describing the genre of The Circle."
