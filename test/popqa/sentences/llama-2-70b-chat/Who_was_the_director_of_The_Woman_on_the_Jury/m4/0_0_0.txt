  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Woman on the Jury? are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information and identify John Francis Dillon as the director of the film. The only difference between the two statements is the use of parentheses in the first statement, which is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence."
