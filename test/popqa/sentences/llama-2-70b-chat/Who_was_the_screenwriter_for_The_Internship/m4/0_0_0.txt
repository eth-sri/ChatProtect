  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Internship? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that both Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern were the screenwriters for the movie, while Statement 2 only mentions Vince Vaughn as the screenwriter. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
