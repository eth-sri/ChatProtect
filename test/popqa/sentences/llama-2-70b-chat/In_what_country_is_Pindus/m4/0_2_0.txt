  "explanation": "The statements about the location of Pindus are contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Pindus as a mountain range located in Greece, while the second statement incorrectly states that Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece, is part of the Pindus range. Mount Olympus is actually located in a separate mountain range called the Olympus range, which is located in northern Greece. Therefore, the second statement contradicts the first statement by suggesting that Pindus includes Mount Olympus, which it does not."
