  "explanation": "The statements about In what country is Ida Ridge? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Ida Ridge is a fictional location and does not exist in the real world, while Statement 2 asserts that Ida Ridge is in Antarctica. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. If Ida Ridge is a fictional location, it cannot exist in Antarctica or any other real-world location. Conversely, if Ida Ridge is in Antarctica, it cannot be a fictional location that does not exist in the real world. Therefore, the two statements are contradictory."
