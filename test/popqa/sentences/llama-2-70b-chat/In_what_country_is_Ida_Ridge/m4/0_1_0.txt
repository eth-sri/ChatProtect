  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Ida Ridge?\" are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that Ida Ridge is a fictional location and does not exist in the real world, and therefore cannot be located in any country or region. Statement 2 simply expands on the idea presented in Statement 1 by explicitly stating that Ida Ridge is not located in any country or region."
