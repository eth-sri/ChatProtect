  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Ida Ridge?\" are not contradictory. Both statements suggest that Ida Ridge is not a real place and does not exist in any country. While statement 1 clarifies that Ida Ridge is a fictional location, statement 2 emphasizes that it does not exist in any real country. Therefore, both statements convey the same idea that Ida Ridge is not a real place."
