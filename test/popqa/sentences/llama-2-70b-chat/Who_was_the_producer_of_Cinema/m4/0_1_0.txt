While statement 1 acknowledges the role of producers in the development of cinema, it also recognizes the contributions of other individuals and groups. Statement 2 focuses specifically on the inventors and innovators involved in the development of cinema, but does not necessarily contradict the role of producers. Both statements highlight the collaborative nature of the development of cinema and the involvement of multiple parties."
