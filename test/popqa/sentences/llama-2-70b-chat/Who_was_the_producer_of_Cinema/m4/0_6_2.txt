  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Cinema? are not contradictory. While the text mentions that the development of cinema was a collaborative effort of many individuals and groups, it highlights specific key figures in the history of cinema, including Eadweard Muybridge, Louis Le Prince, and the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. Statement 1 credits Louis Le Prince with creating the first film with a narrative, while Statement 2 notes that the Lumi\u00e8re brothers directed the first film with a narrative. Both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other, as they simply highlight different individuals who played a significant role in the early history of cinema."
