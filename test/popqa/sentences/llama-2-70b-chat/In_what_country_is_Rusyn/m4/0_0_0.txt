  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"In what country is Rusyn?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that Rusyn is spoken in several countries, including Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Russia, while Statement 2 specifically mentions Slovakia as the country where Rusyn is spoken. Therefore, Statement 2 contradicts the broader claim made in Statement 1."
