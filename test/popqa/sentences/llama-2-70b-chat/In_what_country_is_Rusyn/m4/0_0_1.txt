  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Rusyn?\" are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Rusyn is spoken in several countries, including Slovakia, while Statement 2 specifically states that Rusyn is spoken in Slovakia only. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
