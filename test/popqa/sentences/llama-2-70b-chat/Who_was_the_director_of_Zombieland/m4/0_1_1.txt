  "explanation": "The statements about the director of Zombieland are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Ruben Fleischer's career as a director after Zombieland. Statement 1 mentions that Zombieland was his first feature film as a director and lists some of the other films he has directed since then. Statement 2 simply reiterates that he has directed other successful films, specifically mentioning Gangster Squad and Venom. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Ruben Fleischer directed Zombieland."
