  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Missing? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Stuart Adamson, the lead vocalist and guitarist of Big Country, composed the song \"Missing\". On the other hand, statement 2 claims that the British singer-songwriter Morrissey composed the same song. Since the two statements provide different answers to the same question, they cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they are contradictory."
