  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Le Fils d'Amr est mort? are contradictory. The beginning of the text states that Le Fils d'Amr est mort is a play written by Jean-Jacques Bernard, which implies that there was no screenwriter involved. However, the second statement contradicts this by stating that there was a screenplay for the work, which was written by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
