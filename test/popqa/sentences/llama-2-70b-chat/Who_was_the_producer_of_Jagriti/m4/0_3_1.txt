The first statement provides information about Satyajit Ray's involvement in the film Jagriti as a producer, writer, and director. The second statement provides additional information about Ray's feature film directorial debut, which was a different film called \"Pather Panchali\" that was also released in 1955. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
