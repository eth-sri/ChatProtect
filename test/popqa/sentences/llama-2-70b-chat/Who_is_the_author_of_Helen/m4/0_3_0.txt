  "explanation": "The statements about the authorship of \"Helen\" are contradictory. The first statement suggests that the author is unknown and that there have been many theories and speculations about the authorship, while the second statement states that it was written in the 12th century. If the poem was written in the 12th century, then it is not possible for it to have been written by a contemporary of Shakespeare or a forgotten poet of the Renaissance, as suggested in the first statement. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
