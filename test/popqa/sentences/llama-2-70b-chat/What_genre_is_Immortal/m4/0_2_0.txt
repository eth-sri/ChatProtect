  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Immortal are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that while Immortal is primarily classified as black metal, their music has evolved over time and incorporated elements from other genres. The first statement specifically mentions their incorporation of unconventional sounds and approaches to song structure, which has led to their classification as avant-garde or experimental metal. The second statement simply reiterates this point without providing additional detail. Overall, both statements support the idea that Immortal's genre classification is not static and has evolved over time."
