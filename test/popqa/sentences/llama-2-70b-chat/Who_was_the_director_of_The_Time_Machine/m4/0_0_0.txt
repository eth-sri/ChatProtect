  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of The Time Machine are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Simon Wells directed the 2002 film The Time Machine. The only difference is the structure of the sentences. Statement 1 uses a subject-verb-object structure while Statement 2 uses a passive voice structure."
