  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Way Out? are contradictory because they provide different names for the director of the TV series \"Way Out\". Statement 1 claims that Allen Reisner was the director, while Statement 2 claims that Langley Howard was the director. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
