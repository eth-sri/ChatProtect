  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Island are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Alex Kurtzman as the screenwriter for the film, while statement 2 correctly identifies Michael Bay as the director. Being the director does not necessarily mean that one is also the screenwriter, so both statements can be true at the same time."
