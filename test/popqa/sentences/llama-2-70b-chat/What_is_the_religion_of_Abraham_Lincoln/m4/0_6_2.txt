Throughout his life, he expressed beliefs that were influenced by various Christian denominations, including Baptist, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian. However, he also expressed some unorthodox views, such as questioning the divinity of Jesus and the authority of the Bible. Some scholars have described Lincoln's religious views as a form of \"liberal Christianity\" or \"civil religion,\" which emphasized the importance of personal morality, individual liberty, and the principles of democracy. Others have described him as a \"deist,\" meaning that he believed in a God who created the universe but did not intervene in its affairs.",
