  "explanation": "The statements about Abraham Lincoln's religion are not contradictory. They both describe his religious views as emphasizing personal beliefs and individual interpretation, rather than strict adherence to a specific denomination or doctrine. The first statement describes his views as a form of \"liberal Christianity\" or \"civil religion,\" while the second statement emphasizes his personal spirituality. Both statements suggest that Lincoln's religious beliefs were complex and not easily categorized within a specific denomination or tradition."
