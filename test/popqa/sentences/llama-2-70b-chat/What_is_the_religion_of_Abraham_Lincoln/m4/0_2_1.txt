  "explanation": "The statements about Abraham Lincoln's religion are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Lincoln's beliefs were influenced by various Christian denominations, including Baptist and Presbyterian. The only difference is that statement 1 includes Episcopalian as an additional denomination that influenced Lincoln's beliefs, while statement 2 includes Methodist instead. However, this difference does not contradict the overall idea that Lincoln's religious beliefs were shaped by multiple Christian denominations."
