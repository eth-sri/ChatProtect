  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Butterfly? are contradictory. The first statement states that Butterfly was produced by 20th Century Fox Television and FX Productions, while the second statement claims that it was produced by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff. These are two different sets of producers, and therefore cannot both be true."
