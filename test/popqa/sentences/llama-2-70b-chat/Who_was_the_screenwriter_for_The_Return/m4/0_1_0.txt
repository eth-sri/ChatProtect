  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Return? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that Lawrence Michael Levine is credited as both the director and writer of the film, while Statement 2 suggests that the film was directed by a ghost, which implies that there was no human screenwriter involved in the making of the film. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
