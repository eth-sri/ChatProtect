  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Return are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that the screenwriter is not explicitly stated, while the second and third statements provide additional information about the credits for the film. Lawrence Michael Levine is credited as the writer and director, while Aaron Harberts and Gretchen J. Berg are credited as co-showrunners and executive producers. It is possible that Levine wrote the original screenplay, which was then developed and revised by Harberts and Berg during the production process. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other but rather provide different perspectives on the writing and production of the film."
