  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Return are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Lawrence Michael Levine is involved in the writing of the film, with statement 1 indicating that he is credited as the writer and statement 2 specifying that he is both the writer and director. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Levine played a significant role in the creation of the film's screenplay."
