The first statement explains that the screenwriter is not explicitly stated and that the director, Lawrence Michael Levine, is credited as the writer. The second statement provides additional information about the film's production process, stating that the screenplay was largely improvised by the cast. It also mentions some of the actors who contributed to the film's success. While the second statement does not provide a clear answer to the question of who the screenwriter was, it does not contradict the information provided in the first statement."
