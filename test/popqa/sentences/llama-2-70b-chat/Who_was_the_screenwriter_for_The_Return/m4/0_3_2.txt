  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for The Return are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that Lawrence Michael Levine is credited as the writer and may have had some input in shaping the overall narrative and theme of the film. However, statement 2 explains that Levine had a unique approach to screenwriting that involved allowing the actors to improvise and contribute to the story, which suggests that the screenplay was not entirely written by Levine alone. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that the screenplay for The Return was a collaborative effort."
