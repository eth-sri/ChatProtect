  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for The Return are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that Levine was credited as the writer and may have had some input in shaping the overall narrative and theme, but the extent of his involvement in the screenplay is unclear due to the collaborative process. Statement 2 suggests that Levine may have also contributed to the improvised dialogue, which is not necessarily contradictory to the idea that the screenplay was largely improvised by the cast. Both statements provide additional information about the writing process for the film without contradicting each other."
