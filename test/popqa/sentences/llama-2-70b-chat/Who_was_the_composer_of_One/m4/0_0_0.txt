  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of One? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 correctly identifies Marvin Hamlisch as the composer of \"One\" from the musical \"A Chorus Line\". However, statement 2 is incorrect as U2 did not compose the song \"One\" from the musical. It is possible that statement 2 is referring to a different song titled \"One\" by U2, but it is not relevant to the prompt. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other."
