Both statements provide additional information about David McKenna's work as a screenwriter, including other films he has written screenplays for besides Blow. The only difference is that statement 1 lists specific titles, while statement 2 only mentions two films. However, both statements support the fact that David McKenna has written screenplays for other movies besides Blow."
