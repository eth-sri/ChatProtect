  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of Evil Dead: Hail to the King are contradictory. The first statement describes the game as a survival horror, which typically involves a focus on survival and horror elements such as limited resources, puzzles, and a sense of dread. The second statement describes the game as an action-adventure, which typically involves a focus on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. While both genres can have some overlap, they have distinct differences in their gameplay mechanics and overall tone. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
