  "explanation": "The statements about the setting of Evil Dead: Hail to the King are contradictory. Statement 1 describes the game as being set in a remote cabin in the woods, while Statement 2 describes it as being set in a post-apocalyptic world. These two settings are vastly different and cannot coexist in the same game. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
