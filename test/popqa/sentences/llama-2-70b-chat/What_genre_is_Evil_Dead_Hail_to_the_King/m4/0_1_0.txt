  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Evil Dead: Hail to the King are not contradictory. The first statement identifies it as a survival horror game, while the second statement provides additional context about the game's setting in a post-apocalyptic world. The fact that it is part of the Evil Dead franchise does not contradict either statement, as the franchise includes various horror-themed media. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the game's genre and setting."
