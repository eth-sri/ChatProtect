  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the mother of Sydney Chaplin are not contradictory. Both statements provide additional information about Hannah Chaplin, the mother of Sydney Chaplin. Statement 1 explains that Hannah was married to Charles Chaplin Sr. and was the mother of both Charles and Sydney Chaplin. Statement 2 adds that Hannah was also a dancer and actress. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about Hannah Chaplin."
