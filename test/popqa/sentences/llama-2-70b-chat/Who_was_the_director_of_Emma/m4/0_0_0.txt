  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Emma? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the director of the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma was Douglas McGrath, while Statement 2 claims that the film adaptation was directed by Autumn de Wilde. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they refer to different directors for the same film."
