  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Trilogy are not contradictory. They both provide the same information about the origin of the term \"trilogy\" and its meaning in Greek. The only difference is in the translation of the word \"logos\" as either \"word\" or \"discourse/treatise\". However, both translations convey the same general idea of a written or spoken work."
