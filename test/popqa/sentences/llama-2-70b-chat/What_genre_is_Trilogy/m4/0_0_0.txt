  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Trilogy?\" are not contradictory. Both statements describe the basic definition of a trilogy, which is a set of three related works, whether they are novels, plays, or films. The first statement adds the detail that the works are released in sequence, while the second statement simply states that they are a series. However, both statements ultimately describe the same concept of a trilogy."
