  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Trilogy? are not contradictory. Both statements describe the basic definition of a trilogy, which is a set of three related works, whether they are novels, plays, or films. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that the three works are interconnected, while statement 1 does not necessarily imply that they are. However, both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
