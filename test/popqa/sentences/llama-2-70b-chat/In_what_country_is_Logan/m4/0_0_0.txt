  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"In what country is Logan?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that Logan is located in the state of Utah, which is in the United States. On the other hand, statement 2 claims that Logan is in Australia, which is a completely different country located on the other side of the world. Therefore, these two statements cannot both be true at the same time, and they contradict each other."
