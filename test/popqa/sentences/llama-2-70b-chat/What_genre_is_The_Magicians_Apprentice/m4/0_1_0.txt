  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Magician's Apprentice are not contradictory. The first statement describes the novel as belonging to the subgenre of epic fantasy, which focuses on world-building and often involves a large cast of characters and complex plotlines. The second statement specifies that it is also a young adult fantasy, indicating that the target audience for the novel is teenagers. These two subgenres are not mutually exclusive and can coexist within a single work."
