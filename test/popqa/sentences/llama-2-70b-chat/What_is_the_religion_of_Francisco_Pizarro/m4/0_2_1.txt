  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Francisco Pizarro are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides context for why it is likely that Pizarro was a Catholic Christian, while Statement 2 directly answers the prompt by stating that it was indeed the Catholic Church. Both statements support the idea that Pizarro was a Catholic Christian due to the dominant religion in Spain during his lifetime and the religious practices of Spanish colonizers in the Americas."
