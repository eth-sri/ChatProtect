While the first statement mentions that Ram Gopal Varma is a well-known Indian film director, screenwriter, and producer who has worked in Telugu, Hindi, and Kannada cinema, the second statement specifies that he is known for his work in Telugu cinema. However, neither statement contradicts the fact that Ram Gopal Varma was the screenwriter for the film \"Rangeela\"."
