  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Man Trap? are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Marc Daniels was the director of The Man Trap, the first episode of the original Star Trek television series, which aired on September 8, 1966. The only difference is the way the information is presented. Statement 1 provides the director's name first, followed by additional information about the episode, while Statement 2 presents the episode title first, followed by the director's name."
