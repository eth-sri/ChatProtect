  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Violin Concerto? are not contradictory. While statement 1 provides additional information about the technical and musical difficulty of the concerto, statement 2 simply confirms the year in which it was written. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Ludwig van Beethoven was the composer of the Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61."
