  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Brown Sugar are contradictory. The first statement describes the movie as a romantic comedy-drama, while the second statement suggests that the movie is more of a drama with romantic elements. While both statements mention romance, the emphasis and tone of the descriptions differ, leading to a contradiction in the genre classification."
