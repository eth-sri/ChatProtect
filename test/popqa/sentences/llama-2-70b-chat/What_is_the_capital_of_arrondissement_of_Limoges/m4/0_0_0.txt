  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is the capital of arrondissement of Limoges?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the person is not familiar with the term \"arrondissement of Limoges\" and is unsure what it refers to. However, Statement 2 directly answers the question by stating that the capital of the arrondissement of Limoges is Limoges. Therefore, Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1 by providing a clear answer to the question."
