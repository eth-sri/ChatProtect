  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that France does not have administrative divisions called \"arrondissements\" at the national level, but instead is divided into regions and departments. The second statement acknowledges that arrondissements do exist within departments, which is consistent with the concept of administrative divisions within a larger area. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the administrative structure of France without contradicting each other."
