The first statement provides information about Limoges being the capital of the Haute-Vienne department, which is a well-defined administrative division in France. The second statement acknowledges that the term \"arrondissement of Limoges\" is not commonly used or well-defined, indicating that there may be confusion or ambiguity about what is being referred to. Therefore, the two statements provide different perspectives on the question without contradicting each other."
