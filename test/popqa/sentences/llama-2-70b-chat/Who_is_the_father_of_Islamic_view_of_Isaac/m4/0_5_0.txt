  "prefix": " Ibrahim (Abraham) is considered the father of the Islamic view of Isaac, as he is considered a prophet and a patriarch in Islam. According to Islamic tradition, Abraham was chosen by God to be the father of a great nation, and he was promised that his descendants would be a blessing to all nations. Isaac, who is also known as Ishaq in Arabic, was born to Abraham and his wife Sarah, and he is considered one of the most important figures in Islamic history. He is seen as a righteous and obedient prophet who was willing to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as a test of his faith, and who was later replaced by God with a ram as a sacrifice. Isaac is also important in Islamic tradition because he is seen as the ancestor of the Prophet Muhammad and the father of the Arab nation.",
