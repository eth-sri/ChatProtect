  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Islamic view of Isaac are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that Ibrahim (Abraham) is considered the father of the Islamic view of Isaac, while the second statement provides additional information about Isaac's importance in Islamic history and his role as a model of faith and obedience. Both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Ibrahim is the patriarch of the Abrahamic religions and that his descendants, including Isaac, played significant roles in the history of Islam."
