Isaac, who is also known as Ishaq in Arabic, was born to Abraham and his wife Sarah, and he is considered one of the most important figures in Islamic history. He is seen as a righteous and obedient prophet who was willing to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as a test of his faith, and who was later replaced by God with a ram as a sacrifice.",
