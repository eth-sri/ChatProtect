  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Matilda of Scotland are not contradictory. Both statements identify Matilda's father as Malcolm III of Scotland. The only difference between the two statements is that the first one includes Malcolm's nickname \"Canmore,\" while the second statement does not. However, this does not change the fact that both statements are referring to the same person as Matilda's father."
