  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Westminster the capital of?\" are not contradictory. While Statement 1 clarifies that Westminster is not the capital of any country, Statement 2 provides additional information that Westminster is a district within the city of London, England, and not a capital city in its own right. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
