  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Westminster the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that Westminster is a district within the city of London, England, and not the capital of any country. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"in\" versus \"within,\" which does not change the meaning or contradict each other."
