  "explanation": "Yes, the two statements about the color of the flag of Vanuatu are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 mentions that the flag has two main colors, red and black, while Statement 2 describes the flag as having two horizontal bands of red and green with a black isosceles triangle based on the hoist side bearing the white silhouette of a boar's tusk encircling two crossed namele leaves. There is no mention of black being a main color in Statement 2, and the description of the flag's design does not match the simple description of red and black in Statement 1. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
