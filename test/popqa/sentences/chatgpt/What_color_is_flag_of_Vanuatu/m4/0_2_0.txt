  "explanation": "The statements about the color of the flag of Vanuatu are not contradictory. While the main colors of the flag are red and black, statement 1 correctly adds that there are also yellow symbols on the flag's center. Statement 2 further elaborates on the yellow symbols, specifying that they include a boar's tusk and two leaves. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the colors and symbols present on the flag of Vanuatu."
