The first statement clarifies that the term \"capital\" is not applicable to a county, while the second statement provides information about the largest city and county seat of Madison County in Alabama, which is Huntsville. The first statement also mentions that in other states like Illinois and Nebraska, Madison itself is the county seat. Therefore, both statements provide relevant information about Madison County, but they do not contradict each other."
