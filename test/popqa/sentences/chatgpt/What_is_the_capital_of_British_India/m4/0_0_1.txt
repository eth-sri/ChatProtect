  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of British India are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that Delhi was the capital of British India before independence in 1947. However, statement 2 is incorrect as Calcutta (now Kolkata) was never the capital of British India. It was the capital of British India's Bengal Presidency, but not of the entire British India."
