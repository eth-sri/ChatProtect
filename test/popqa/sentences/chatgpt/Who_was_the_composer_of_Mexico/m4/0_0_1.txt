  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the composer of Mexico?\" are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Mexico has had many influential composers throughout its history and that it is difficult to identify a single composer as \"the composer of Mexico.\" Statement 1 provides examples of some of the notable composers from Mexico, while Statement 2 emphasizes the challenge of singling out one composer as the most significant. Overall, both statements support the idea that Mexico's musical heritage is diverse and rich, with many talented composers contributing to its development."
