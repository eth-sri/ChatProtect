  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Thomas Aquinas College are not contradictory. Both statements identify the college as a Roman Catholic institution, with a curriculum based on the philosophy and theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. The second statement adds that the college is also a liberal arts institution, but this does not contradict the first statement."
