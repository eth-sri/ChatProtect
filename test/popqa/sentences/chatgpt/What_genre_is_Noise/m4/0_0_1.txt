  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Noise? are not contradictory. Both statements describe Noise as an experimental music genre that utilizes unconventional sound sources and techniques to create a chaotic and abrasive sound. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one specifically mentions the incorporation of non-musical sounds and unconventional musical structures. However, this does not contradict the first statement, as it is still describing the same genre of experimental music."
