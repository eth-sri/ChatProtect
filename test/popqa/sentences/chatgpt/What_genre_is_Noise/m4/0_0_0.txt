  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Noise? are not contradictory. Both statements describe Noise as an experimental music genre that utilizes unconventional sound sources and techniques to create a chaotic and abrasive sound. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes the use of noise and dissonance, while statement 1 mentions the incorporation of unconventional sound sources and techniques. However, both statements ultimately describe the same genre of music."
