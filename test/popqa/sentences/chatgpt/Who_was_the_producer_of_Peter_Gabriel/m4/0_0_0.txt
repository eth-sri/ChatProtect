  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Peter Gabriel are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that there have been multiple producers for Peter Gabriel's albums, while also highlighting some notable ones. Statement 2 simply reiterates that the producer varies depending on the album. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Peter Gabriel has worked with different producers throughout his career."
