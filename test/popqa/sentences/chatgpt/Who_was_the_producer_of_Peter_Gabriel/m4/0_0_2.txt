  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Peter Gabriel are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Peter Gabriel worked with multiple producers throughout his career, including Steve Lillywhite and Daniel Lanois. The only difference is that statement 1 includes additional producers such as David Lord and Peter Gabriel himself, while statement 2 includes Brian Eno instead. However, this does not contradict the fact that Peter Gabriel worked with multiple producers."
