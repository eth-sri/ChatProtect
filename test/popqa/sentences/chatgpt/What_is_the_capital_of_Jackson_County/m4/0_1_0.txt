The first statement lists the capitals of Jackson County in Oregon, Michigan, and Ohio, while the second statement lists the capitals of Jackson County in Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple counties named Jackson in different states, and therefore, the capital of Jackson County depends on which state is being referred to."
