  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Basel-Stadt are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Basel-Stadt does not have a capital, while the second statement provides additional information about the city of Basel serving as the administrative center of the canton. The second statement also mentions that Basel-Stadt is one of the smallest cantons in Switzerland and operates as a city-state, which is not directly related to the question of its capital. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
