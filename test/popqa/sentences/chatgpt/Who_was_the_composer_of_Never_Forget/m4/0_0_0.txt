  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Never Forget? are contradictory. Statement 1 provides a direct answer to the prompt, stating that the composer of Never Forget is Martin O'Donnell. However, Statement 2 questions the validity of the prompt, suggesting that \"Never Forget\" is the name of a song, not a composer. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
