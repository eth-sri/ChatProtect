  "explanation": "The statements about the location of Satrapy of Armenia are not contradictory, but they provide different perspectives. Statement 1 mentions that the Satrapy of Armenia is located in modern-day Turkey, while Statement 2 refers to the Armenian Highlands. This is because the region of Armenia has undergone various historical and political changes, and its borders have shifted over time. Therefore, both statements can be considered accurate depending on the context and time period being referred to."
