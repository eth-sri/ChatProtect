  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. They both provide the same information about the Satrapy of Armenia being a province of the Achaemenid Empire and the time period during which it was ruled by the empire. The only difference is the way the information is presented. Statement 1 uses the term \"satrapy\" while Statement 2 uses the term \"province\", but they both refer to the same administrative division within the Achaemenid Empire."
