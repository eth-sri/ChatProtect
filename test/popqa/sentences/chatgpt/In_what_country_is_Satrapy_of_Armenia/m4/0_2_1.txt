Statement 1 clarifies that the Satrapy of Armenia should not be confused with the modern-day Republic of Armenia, which is a separate and independent country. Statement 2 simply restates the information from the beginning of the text that the Satrapy of Armenia was not an independent country, but rather a province of the Achaemenid Empire. Both statements provide additional information about the Satrapy of Armenia without contradicting each other."
