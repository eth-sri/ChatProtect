The first statement emphasizes that the Satrapy of Armenia is an ancient geographical region located in modern-day Turkey, while the second statement highlights that the modern-day Republic of Armenia is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Both statements provide additional information to help distinguish between the two entities."
