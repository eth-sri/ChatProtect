  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the genre of Thin Ice are contradictory. The first statement classifies Thin Ice as a comedy-drama film, which suggests that the film has elements of both comedy and drama. However, the second statement classifies Thin Ice as a crime thriller film, which suggests that the film has elements of crime and suspense. These two genres are quite different from each other, and it is unlikely that a film could be both a comedy-drama and a crime thriller. Therefore, the statements are contradictory."
