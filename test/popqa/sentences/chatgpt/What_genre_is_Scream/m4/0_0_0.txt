  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Scream are not contradictory. Statement 1 specifies that Scream is a horror/slasher film, indicating that it belongs to both the horror and slasher subgenres. Statement 2 simply states that Scream is a horror film, which is consistent with the first statement as it falls under the broader category of horror. Therefore, both statements are complementary and not contradictory."
