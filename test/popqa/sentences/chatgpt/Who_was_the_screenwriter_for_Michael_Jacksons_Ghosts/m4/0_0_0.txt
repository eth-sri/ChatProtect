  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Michael Jackson's Ghosts? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Michael Jackson co-wrote the screenplay with Stephen King, while Statement 2 claims that Stephen King was the sole screenwriter. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present different information about the authorship of the screenplay."
