  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of I Miss You? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that there are multiple songs titled \"I Miss You\" composed by different artists, while Statement 2 identifies Harold Faltermeyer as the composer of \"I Miss You.\" Therefore, Statement 2 contradicts Statement 1 by providing a specific composer for the song."
