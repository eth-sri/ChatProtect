  "explanation": "The statements about John Entwistle's genre are not contradictory. Both statements agree that he is primarily known as a bassist for a rock band, The Who. The only difference is that the first statement adds the detail that he is a rock musician, while the second statement simply states that he is a bassist for a rock band. However, both statements ultimately classify him as a rock musician."
