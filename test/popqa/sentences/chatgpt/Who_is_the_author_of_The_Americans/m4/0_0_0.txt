  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Americans? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Robert Frank as the author of The Americans, while statement 2 incorrectly identifies Frank O'Hara as the author. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
