  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the director of Action?\" are not contradictory. Both statements indicate that the AI language model lacks sufficient information or context to provide an accurate answer to the question. Statement 1 suggests that the model may not have any information about the movie or its director, while Statement 2 implies that there may be multiple movies titled \"Action\" and the model cannot determine which one is being referred to. Therefore, both statements are consistent in their explanation of why the AI language model cannot answer the question."
