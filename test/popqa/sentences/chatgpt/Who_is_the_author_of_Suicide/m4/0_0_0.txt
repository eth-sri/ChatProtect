  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Suicide? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there are multiple authors who have written about suicide, while the second statement specifically identifies Emile Durkheim as the author of a book titled Suicide. Therefore, the two statements are complementary rather than contradictory."
