  "explanation": "The statements about where Thomas Seaton Scott was born are contradictory because one states that he was born in Scottsville, Virginia, while the other states that he was born in London, England. These two locations are in different countries and continents, making it impossible for both statements to be true. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
