  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of the Kingdom of England are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Statement 2 provides additional information about the initial religion of the Kingdom of England, which was Catholic, and how it later became Protestant during the reign of Henry VIII. Statement 1 provides further details about the established church during the Tudor era, which was the Church of England, a Protestant denomination. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of the religious history of the Kingdom of England."
