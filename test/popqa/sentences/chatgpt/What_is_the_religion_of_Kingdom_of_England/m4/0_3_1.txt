  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of the Kingdom of England are not contradictory. They both state that England became predominantly Protestant during the reign of Elizabeth I and has remained so ever since. The only difference is that statement 2 is a more general statement about the dominance of Protestantism in England, while statement 1 provides more specific historical context about the shift from Catholicism to Protestantism during the Tudor era."
