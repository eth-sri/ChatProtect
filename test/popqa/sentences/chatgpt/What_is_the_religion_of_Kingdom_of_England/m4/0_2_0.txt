  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of the Kingdom of England are not contradictory. They both acknowledge the fact that the country went through different religious phases, including Protestantism and Catholicism, during the reigns of different monarchs. The first statement highlights the initial dominance of Christianity and the establishment of the Church of England during the Tudor era, while the second statement focuses on the religious turmoil and persecution that occurred during the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. Both statements provide complementary information about the complex religious history of the Kingdom of England."
