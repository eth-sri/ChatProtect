  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Kingdom of England are not contradictory. Both statements mention the Church of England as the established church, with statement 1 specifying that it was the predominant Christian religion during the Tudor era and statement 2 indicating that it has been the established church since the 16th century. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the religion of Kingdom of England."
