  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Kingdom of England are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the country became Protestant under Elizabeth I and has remained predominantly Protestant ever since. The only difference is in the wording of the first statement, which uses \"it then became\" instead of \"it became a Protestant country again.\" However, both statements convey the same information and do not contradict each other."
