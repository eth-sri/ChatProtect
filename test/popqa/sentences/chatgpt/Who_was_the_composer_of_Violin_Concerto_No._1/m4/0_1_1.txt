  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Violin Concerto No. 1 are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple compositions with the same title and that the composer of Violin Concerto No. 1 depends on which specific composition is being referred to. Statement 1 emphasizes that there are multiple composers who have written a violin concerto with this title, while Statement 2 emphasizes that there are multiple versions of Violin Concerto No. 1. Both statements are correct and provide additional context to the question."
