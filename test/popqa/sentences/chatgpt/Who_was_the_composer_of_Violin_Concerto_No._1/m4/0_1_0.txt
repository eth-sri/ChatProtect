  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple compositions titled Violin Concerto No. 1, and therefore the composer of a specific Violin Concerto No. 1 would depend on which composition is being referred to. The first statement emphasizes that there are multiple composers who have written a violin concerto with this title, while the second statement emphasizes that there are several compositions with that title by different composers. Both statements provide additional context to clarify the question and avoid any confusion about which specific composition is being referred to."
