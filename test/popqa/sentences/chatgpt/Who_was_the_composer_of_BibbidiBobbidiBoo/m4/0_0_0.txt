  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo are not contradictory. Both statements mention the same three composers - Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston. The only difference is in the way the information is presented, with statement 1 specifying that Mack David wrote the lyrics and Hoffman and Livingston composed the music, while statement 2 lists all three as composers. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the composers of Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."
