  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Matthew was a Jewish man who became a follower of Jesus Christ and one of his twelve disciples. The second statement specifically mentions that Matthew's faith was based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, which aligns with the beliefs of Christianity. However, being a Jewish man does not necessarily preclude one from also being a Christian, as Christianity has its roots in Judaism. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and not contradictory."
