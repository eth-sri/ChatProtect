  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Matthew was a Jewish man who followed Jesus Christ. The only difference is in the wording, where the first statement emphasizes that Matthew became one of Jesus' twelve disciples, while the second statement emphasizes that Matthew followed Jesus of Nazareth. Overall, both statements support the idea that Matthew's religion was Jewish, but he also followed the teachings of Jesus."
