  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. The first statement suggests that Matthew followed the teachings of Jesus Christ and became one of his disciples, which implies that he was a Christian. The second statement provides additional information about Matthew's occupation before he became a disciple, but it does not contradict the idea that he was a Christian. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
