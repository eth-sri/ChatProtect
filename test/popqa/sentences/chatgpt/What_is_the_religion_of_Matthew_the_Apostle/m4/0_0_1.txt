  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Matthew was a Jewish man, but statement 1 goes on to explain that he followed the teachings of Jesus Christ and became one of his disciples. This suggests that Matthew's religious beliefs evolved over time, but it does not contradict the fact that he was originally Jewish."
