  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Matthew the Apostle are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Matthew was a Jewish man who became a disciple of Jesus Christ and one of the twelve apostles. The fact that he is traditionally considered the author of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament further supports his association with Christianity. However, his Jewish background and initial adherence to Judaism do not negate his later conversion to Christianity. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide a comprehensive understanding of Matthew's religious background and affiliation."
