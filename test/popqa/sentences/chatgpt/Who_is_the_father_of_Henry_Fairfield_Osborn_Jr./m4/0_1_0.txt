  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr. are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Henry Fairfield Osborn, Sr. was the father of Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr. and also a prominent paleontologist who served as the president of the American Museum of Natural History. The only difference between the two statements is the duration of his presidency, but this does not contradict the fact that he was indeed the father of Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr."
