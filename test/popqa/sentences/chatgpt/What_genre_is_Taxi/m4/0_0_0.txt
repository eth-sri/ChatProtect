  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Taxi are not contradictory, but rather one is a more specific subgenre of the other. Statement 1 describes Taxi as a comedy-drama film, indicating that it contains elements of both comedy and drama. Statement 2 simply describes Taxi as a comedy film, which is a broader genre that encompasses any film that is primarily intended to be humorous. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
