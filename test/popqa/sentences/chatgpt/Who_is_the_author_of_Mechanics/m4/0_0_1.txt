  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Mechanics? are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that Mechanics is a branch of physics that has been studied and developed by many scientists over time, meaning that there is no one single author of Mechanics. Statement 2 simply points out that the prompt is incomplete and asks for more context or clarification. Both statements are valid and do not contradict each other."
