  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Mechanics is not the work of a single author, but rather a collective effort of many scientists over time. The second statement provides a brief definition of what Mechanics is, which is not related to the authorship of the field. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
