  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Mechanics? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Mechanics is a branch of physics that has been developed by many scientists over many years. The only difference between the two statements is the list of influential contributors mentioned. Statement 1 includes Leonhard Euler and Pierre-Simon Laplace, while Statement 2 includes Albert Einstein instead. This difference in the list of contributors does not contradict the fact that Mechanics is a collaborative effort of many scientists over time."
