  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Mechanics? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Mechanics is a collective effort of many scientists over many years, while Statement 2 attributes the development of Mechanics to a single person, Sir Isaac Newton. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
