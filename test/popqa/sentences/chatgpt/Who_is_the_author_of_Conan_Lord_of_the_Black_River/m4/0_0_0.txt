  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Conan, Lord of the Black River? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author is Andrew J. Offutt, while statement 2 claims that the author is William Galen Gray. Since they provide different names for the author, they cannot both be true at the same time."
