  "explanation": "The two statements about the color of Arsenal F.C. are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the primary colors of Arsenal F.C. are red and white. The only difference is that the second statement includes the name of the football club, while the first statement does not. Therefore, both statements are consistent and convey the same message."
