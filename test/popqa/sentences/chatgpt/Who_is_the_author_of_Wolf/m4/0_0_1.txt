Statement 1 acknowledges that the term \"Wolf\" could refer to various works featuring a wolf, while Statement 2 specifically identifies Sarah DeLappe as the author of a play called \"Wolf\" and highlights her tendency to use all-female casts. The two statements are not mutually exclusive and can both be true."
