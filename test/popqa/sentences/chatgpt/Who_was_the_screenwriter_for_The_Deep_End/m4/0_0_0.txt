  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Deep End? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the screenwriting credit for The Deep End goes to both Scott McGehee and David Siegel, while Statement 2 suggests that only Scott McGehee was the screenwriter for the film. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
