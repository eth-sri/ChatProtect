  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Midnight? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Mitchell Leisen as the director of the 1939 film Midnight, while Statement 2 incorrectly identifies Bong Joon-ho as the director. As Bong Joon-ho was not even born until 1969, it is impossible for him to have directed a film released in 1939. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
