  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Rivals? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple books titled Rivals by different authors, and the author of a specific book titled Rivals would depend on the context or which book is being referred to. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
