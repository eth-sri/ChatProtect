  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Grease are not contradictory. Both statements identify the genre of the movie as a combination of musical and romantic comedy. The only difference between the two statements is the use of a slash (/) versus the word \"and\" to separate the two genres. However, this does not change the overall meaning of the statements."
