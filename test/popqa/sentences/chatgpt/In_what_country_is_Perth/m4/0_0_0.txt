  "explanation": "The two statements about \"In what country is Perth?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same answer that Perth is located in Australia. The first statement simply states the country name, while the second statement adds more information by specifying that Perth is a city within Australia. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
