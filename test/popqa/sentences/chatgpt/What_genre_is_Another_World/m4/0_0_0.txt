  "explanation": "The two statements about the genre of Another World are not contradictory. The first statement identifies Another World as a platform action-adventure game, while the second statement adds the descriptor \"cinematic\" to further specify the type of platform action-adventure game it is. Therefore, the second statement is simply providing more detail about the genre of Another World, rather than contradicting the first statement."
