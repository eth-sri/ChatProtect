  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The One Million Pound Note? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the screenwriter was Jill Craigie, while statement 2 claims that the screenwriter was Ren\u00e9 Clair. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
