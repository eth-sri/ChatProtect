  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Memories? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that the original version of \"Memories\" was produced by The Monsters and the Strangerz, while Statement 2 claims that it was produced by Avicii. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the producer of the song. Therefore, they are contradictory."
