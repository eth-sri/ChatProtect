  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Images? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. One statement claims that the producer was Robert Sterne, while the other claims it was Robert Altman. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct and further investigation is needed to determine the true producer of Images."
