  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of At This Moment are not necessarily contradictory, but they do offer different perspectives on the song's classification.

While these two genres may have some overlap, they do have distinct characteristics and histories. Therefore, the two statements offer different ways of understanding the genre of At This Moment, but they are not necessarily contradictory."
