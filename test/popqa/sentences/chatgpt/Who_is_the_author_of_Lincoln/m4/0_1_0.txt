Statement 1 acknowledges that there are multiple books about Lincoln with the same or similar titles, and therefore asks for clarification on which specific book is being referred to. Statement 2 simply states that the prompt is too vague to provide a specific answer, and asks for more information. Both statements are seeking clarification and do not contradict each other."
