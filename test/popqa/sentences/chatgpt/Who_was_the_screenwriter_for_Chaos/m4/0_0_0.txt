  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Chaos? are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter of the same movie. It is not possible for both D. Lee Bermingham and Frank Hannah to be the screenwriter for Chaos. Therefore, one of the statements must be incorrect."
