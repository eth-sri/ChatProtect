  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Family are not contradictory. Both statements confirm that Luc Besson was the screenwriter and director of the film. Statement 1 emphasizes his role as the screenwriter, while Statement 2 emphasizes his role as the director. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
