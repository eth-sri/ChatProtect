  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Interface? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the book was co-authored by Neal Stephenson and J. Frederick George, while Statement 2 suggests that Neal Stephenson is the sole author. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
