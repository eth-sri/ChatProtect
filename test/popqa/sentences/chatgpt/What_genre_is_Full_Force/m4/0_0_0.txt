  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Full Force are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Full Force is a hip-hop group, but the first statement adds that they incorporate elements of R&B, dance, and pop music into their sound. The second statement highlights their contributions to the R&B and hip hop genres, which is consistent with being a hip-hop group. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the genre of Full Force."
