  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Full Force are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Full Force is a hip-hop group that incorporates elements of R&B and pop music into their sound. The only difference is that the first statement also includes dance as an element, while the second statement includes funk. However, these differences do not contradict each other and can be seen as additional elements that contribute to Full Force's overall genre."
