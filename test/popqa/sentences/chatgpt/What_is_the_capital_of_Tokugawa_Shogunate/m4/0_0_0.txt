  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Tokugawa Shogunate are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same answer to the prompt, with the only difference being the inclusion of the phrase \"present-day\" in statement 1. This phrase simply clarifies that Edo is now known as Tokyo, without changing the answer to the prompt. Therefore, both statements are consistent and accurate."
