  "explanation": "The two statements about the birthplace of Lucia de Berk are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Lucia de Berk was born in the city of The Hague, Netherlands. The only difference is the use of the definite article \"the\" before the city name in the second statement. However, this does not change the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
