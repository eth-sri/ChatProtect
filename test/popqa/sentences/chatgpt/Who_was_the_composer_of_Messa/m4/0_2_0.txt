  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Messa? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there have been numerous composers who have written masses throughout history, but they provide different examples of composers who have done so. Statement 1 includes Giuseppe Verdi as an additional example, while Statement 2 does not. However, this difference in examples does not contradict the fact that there have been multiple composers of Messa."
