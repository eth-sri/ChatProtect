  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Messa? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple compositions with the name \"Messa,\" and therefore the composer would depend on which specific piece is being referred to. Statement 1 is more general, while Statement 2 emphasizes the fact that there are several compositions with the same name."
