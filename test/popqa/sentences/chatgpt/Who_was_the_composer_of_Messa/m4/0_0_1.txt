  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the composer of Messa?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that there are multiple compositions with the title \"Messa,\" and therefore the composer cannot be determined without specifying which one is being referred to. Statement 2 then specifies that the composer of \"Messa da Requiem\" is Giuseppe Verdi. Therefore, both statements are consistent and provide a complete answer to the question."
