The first statement acknowledges that there have been numerous composers who have written masses throughout history, implying that there is no single composer of \"Messa.\" The second statement reinforces this idea by stating that \"Messa\" is a generic term that can refer to compositions by various composers. Both statements are consistent with the idea that there is no one composer of \"Messa.\""
