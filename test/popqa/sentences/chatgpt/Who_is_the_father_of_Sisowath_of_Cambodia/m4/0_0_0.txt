  "explanation": "The statements about the father of Sisowath of Cambodia are not contradictory. Both statements identify Sisowath's father as a king of Cambodia named Norodom, with the second statement providing the additional detail that his full name was Norodom Suramarit. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide complementary information about Sisowath's father."
