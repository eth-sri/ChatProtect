Both statements agree that fishing does not fit into a specific genre as it is not typically associated with arts and entertainment. The first statement emphasizes that fishing is not a music or literary genre, while the second statement highlights that fishing is an activity or hobby rather than a form of entertainment. Therefore, both statements complement each other in explaining why fishing cannot be classified into a specific genre."
