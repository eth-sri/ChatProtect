  "explanation": "Yes, the statements are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Melbourne does not have a capital as it is a city itself, implying that the question \"What is the capital of City of Melbourne?\" is invalid. \n\nHowever, Statement 2 acknowledges that the City of Melbourne is a local government area within the state of Victoria, and that the capital of Victoria is Melbourne. This suggests that the question is valid and that Melbourne does indeed have a capital. \n\nTherefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time, and are contradictory."
