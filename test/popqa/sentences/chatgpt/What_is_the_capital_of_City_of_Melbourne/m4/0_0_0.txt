Statement 1 claims that Melbourne does not have a capital, while statement 2 claims that Melbourne does not have a capital but also states that it is the capital of the state of Victoria. Therefore, statement 2 contradicts statement 1 by providing additional information that Melbourne is indeed a capital, just not of itself."
