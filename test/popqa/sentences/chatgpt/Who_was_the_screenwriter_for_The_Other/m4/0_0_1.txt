  "explanation": "The two statements about the screenwriter for The Other are not contradictory. They both state that Tom Tryon was the screenwriter for the film and also the author of the novel on which the film is based. Statement 1 provides additional information about Tryon's involvement in both the novel and the film, while Statement 2 simply reiterates that the film is an adaptation of Tryon's novel."
