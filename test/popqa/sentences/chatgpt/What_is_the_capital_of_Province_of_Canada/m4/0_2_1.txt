  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Province of Canada are not contradictory. Both statements agree that during the existence of the Province of Canada, there were two capital cities: Toronto for Upper Canada and Quebec City for Lower Canada. The only difference is that statement 2 adds that the two cities alternated as the seat of government for the Province of Canada. However, this does not contradict statement 1, which also acknowledges the existence of two capital cities."
