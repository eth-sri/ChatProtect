  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the capital of Province of Canada are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Toronto and Quebec City were the capital cities of Upper Canada and Lower Canada respectively, while Statement 2 claims that Kingston and Montreal were the capitals of Upper Canada and Lower Canada respectively. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the capital cities of the Province of Canada."
