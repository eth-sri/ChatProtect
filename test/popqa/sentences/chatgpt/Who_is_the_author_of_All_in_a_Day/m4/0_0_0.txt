  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of All in a Day? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Takashi Hiraide is the author of All in a Day, while Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that \"All in a Day\" is not the name of an author, but rather the name of a short story by Morley Callaghan. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
