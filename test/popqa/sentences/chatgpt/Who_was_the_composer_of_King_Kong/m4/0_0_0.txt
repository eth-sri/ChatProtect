  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of King Kong are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about both the original 1933 version and the 2005 version, stating that Max Steiner composed the original and James Newton Howard composed the 2005 version. Statement 2 only provides information about the original 1933 version and confirms that Max Steiner was the composer. Therefore, both statements are consistent and not contradictory."
