  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Province of Teramo are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the capital of the Province of Teramo is Teramo, which is a city. The only difference is that statement 2 explicitly mentions that Teramo is a city, while statement 1 does not. Therefore, both statements are true and consistent with each other."
