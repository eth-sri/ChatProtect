  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Graduate First? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Maurice Pialat was the screenwriter for the film, while statement 2 claims that Paul Gegauff was the screenwriter. Since the two statements provide different answers to the same question, they cannot both be true at the same time."
