  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of No Doubt are not contradictory. The first statement specifies that No Doubt is primarily a ska-influenced pop rock band, indicating that their music has elements of ska and pop rock. The second statement simply states that No Doubt is a rock band, which is a broader genre that encompasses various sub-genres, including pop rock. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide different levels of specificity about the genre of No Doubt."
