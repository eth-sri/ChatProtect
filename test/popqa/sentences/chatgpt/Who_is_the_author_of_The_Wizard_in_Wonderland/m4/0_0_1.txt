  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Wizard in Wonderland? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same message that there is no known book with the exact title \"The Wizard in Wonderland\" and hence the author's name cannot be provided. The AI language model is unable to find any information about the book, which is why it cannot provide an answer to the question. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
