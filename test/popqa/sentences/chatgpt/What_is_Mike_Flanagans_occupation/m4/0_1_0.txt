  "explanation": "The statements about Mike Flanagan's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements agree that he is a filmmaker and screenwriter, and that he is best known for his work in the horror genre, including directing and writing movies such as \"The Haunting of Hill House\" and \"Doctor Sleep.\" The only difference between the two statements is that one uses the word \"movies\" while the other uses the word \"films,\" which is a minor semantic difference and does not change the overall meaning of the statements."
