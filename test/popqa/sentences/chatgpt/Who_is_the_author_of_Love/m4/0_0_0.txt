  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Love? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that love is an abstract concept and therefore cannot have a specific author. The second statement expands on this idea by noting that while love itself is not an author, it has been explored and written about by many authors throughout history. Both statements are consistent with the idea that love is not a tangible entity that can be attributed to a single author, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that has been explored in various ways by many different writers."
