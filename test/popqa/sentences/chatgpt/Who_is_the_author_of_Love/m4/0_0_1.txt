  "explanation": "The two statements about the author of Love are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Love is an abstract concept and cannot be attributed to a single author. While the first statement explicitly states that Love does not have an author, the second statement implies the same idea by stating that an abstract concept like Love cannot have a single author. Therefore, both statements are consistent in their understanding that Love is not a tangible creation of a single author."
