  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Left Behind? are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins as authors, while Statement 2 only mentions Tim LaHaye. Therefore, Statement 2 is a subset of Statement 1, and both statements can be true at the same time."
