  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Tang Empire are not contradictory. While the Tang Empire practiced a variety of religious beliefs, including Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and various folk religions, statement 1 highlights that Buddhism became the most prevalent and influential religion during the Tang Dynasty. Statement 2 further supports this by noting that Buddhism was particularly prominent during the Tang Dynasty and was even supported by the imperial court. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the role of Buddhism in the religion of Tang Empire."
