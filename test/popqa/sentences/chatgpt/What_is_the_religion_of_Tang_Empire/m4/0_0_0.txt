  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Tang Empire are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the Tang Empire practiced multiple religions including Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and various folk religions. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"beliefs\" in the first statement, which is not present in the second statement. However, this difference does not change the overall meaning of the statements."
