  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of String Quartet No. 3? are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that there are multiple compositions with the same title by different composers, which means that the answer to the question depends on which specific String Quartet No. 3 is being referred to. Statement 2 provides the answer to the question if the specific composition being referred to is String Quartet No. 3 in D major by Franz Joseph Haydn. Therefore, both statements are necessary to provide a complete and accurate answer to the question."
