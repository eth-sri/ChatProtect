  "explanation": "The two statements about Who was the composer of String Quartet No. 3? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the fact that there are multiple compositions with the same title by different composers, and the composer of String Quartet No. 3 cannot be determined without specifying which work is being referred to. The first statement explicitly states this fact, while the second statement implies it. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a complete answer to the question."
