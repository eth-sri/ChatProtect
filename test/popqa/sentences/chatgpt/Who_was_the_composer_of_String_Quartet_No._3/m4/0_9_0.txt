  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of String Quartet No. 3? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the importance of specifying which specific composition is being referred to, as there are multiple works with the same title by different composers. Statement 1 uses the phrase \"which work,\" while statement 2 uses the phrase \"which specific composition,\" but both convey the same idea that the composer cannot be determined without further clarification."
