  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of String Quartet No. 3? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the fact that there are multiple compositions with the same title by different composers. They both suggest that the answer to the question depends on which specific piece is being referred to. While statement 1 specifically mentions that there are multiple compositions with the same title, statement 2 expands on this idea by stating that there are many composers who have written a piece titled \"String Quartet No. 3\". Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a clear understanding of the complexity of the question."
