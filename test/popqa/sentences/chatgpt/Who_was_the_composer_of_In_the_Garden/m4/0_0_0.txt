  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of In the Garden? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the composer of In the Garden is unknown, while Statement 2 asserts that the composer is Charles Austin Miles. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they are contradictory."
