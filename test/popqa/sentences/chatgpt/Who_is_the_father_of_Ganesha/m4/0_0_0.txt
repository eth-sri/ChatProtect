  "explanation": "The two statements about the father of Ganesha are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same meaning and imply that Lord Shiva is regarded as the father of Ganesha in Hindu mythology. The only difference between the two statements is the use of the phrase \"considered to be\" in the second statement, which is a more formal way of expressing the same idea. Therefore, both statements are correct and do not contradict each other."
