Both statements agree that Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg was a Catholic and that his faith played a significant role in his decision to resist Hitler's regime. The only difference is in the use of the words \"important\" and \"significant,\" which are synonyms and do not change the overall meaning of the statements."
