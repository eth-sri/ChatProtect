  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of One More Time are not contradictory, but rather refer to different aspects of the film. Statement 1 refers to the overall genre of the film as a comedy-drama, which encompasses the plot, characters, and themes. Statement 2 refers to the music genre of the film's soundtrack, which is electronic dance music. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
