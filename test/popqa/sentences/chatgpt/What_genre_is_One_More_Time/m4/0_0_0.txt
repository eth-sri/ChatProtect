  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is One More Time? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 refers to One More Time as a Swedish comedy-drama film, categorizing it under the drama and comedy genres. On the other hand, Statement 2 refers to One More Time as a song by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, implying that it belongs to the music genre. These two statements describe completely different works of art, and therefore cannot both be true for the same piece of media."
