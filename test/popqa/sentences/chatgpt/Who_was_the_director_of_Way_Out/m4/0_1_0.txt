  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the director of Way Out? are contradictory. The first statement lists Franklin Schaffner and William Friedkin as directors, while the second statement lists John Newland and William Conrad. These two lists do not have any directors in common, which means that they are presenting different information about the directors of the TV series."
