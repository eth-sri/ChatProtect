  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of The Visit? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. Statement 1 claims that John Kander is the composer of The Visit, while Statement 2 claims that Maurice Jarre is the composer. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
