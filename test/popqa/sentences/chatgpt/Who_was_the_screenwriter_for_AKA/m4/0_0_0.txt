  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for AKA? are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter. Statement 1 claims that Dean Craig was the screenwriter for AKA, while statement 2 claims that Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was the screenwriter. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
