  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Medium? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 clearly states that the screenwriter for The Medium is Mel Mendoza-Del Rosario, while Statement 2 states that the film was directed by Mikhail Red. The two statements are not related to each other and do not provide any information that supports or complements each other. Therefore, they cannot both be true at the same time, making them contradictory."
