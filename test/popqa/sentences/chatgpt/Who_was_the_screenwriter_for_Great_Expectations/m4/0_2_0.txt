  "explanation": "The statements about the screenwriter for Great Expectations are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the screenwriter for Great Expectations varies depending on the adaptation, while the second statement provides additional information about the novel itself being written by Charles Dickens and first published in serial form between 1860 and 1861. The two statements are complementary and provide different but relevant information about the topic."
