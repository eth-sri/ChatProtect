  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is London the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 is correct in stating that London is the capital of England. Statement 2 expands on this by adding that London is also the capital of the United Kingdom, which includes England as well as Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
