  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The End of Violence? are contradictory because they provide different names for the producer of the film. Statement 1 claims that Michael W. De Luca was the producer, while statement 2 claims that Michael Wearing was the producer. As both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other."
