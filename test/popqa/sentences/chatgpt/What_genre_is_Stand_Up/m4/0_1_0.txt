  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of stand-up comedy are not contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that stand-up comedy is a sub-genre of comedy, meaning that it falls under the larger umbrella of comedy as a whole. Statement 2 expands on this by highlighting the unique characteristics of stand-up comedy, such as the performer's ability to connect with the audience through humor and storytelling. Both statements provide different perspectives on the genre of stand-up comedy, but they are not contradictory."
