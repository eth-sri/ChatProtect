  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is South China Sea?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide accurate information about the location and bordering countries of the South China Sea. The first statement provides a more comprehensive list of the countries that border the South China Sea, while the second statement highlights some of the key countries that share a border with the sea. Overall, both statements support the fact that the South China Sea is not located within a single country, but rather is a body of water that is shared by multiple countries in Southeast Asia."
