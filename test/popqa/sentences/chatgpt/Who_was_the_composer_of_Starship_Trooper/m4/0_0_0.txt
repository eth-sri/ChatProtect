  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Starship Trooper are contradictory. Statement 1 lists three members of the band Yes as the composers, while Statement 2 attributes the composition to Basil Poledouris, a film composer who did not have any involvement with Yes. Therefore, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
