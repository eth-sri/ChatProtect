  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Sahibzada Jujhar Singh are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Sahibzada Jujhar Singh was the eldest son of Guru Gobind Singh, while statement 2 claims that he was the second son. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they contradict each other."
