  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Angry Dad: The Movie are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the screenwriter was a fictional character, while statement 2 suggests that the screenwriter was a real person named Bart Simpson. As Bart Simpson is a fictional character on The Simpsons, it is not possible for him to be a real person and a fictional character at the same time. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
