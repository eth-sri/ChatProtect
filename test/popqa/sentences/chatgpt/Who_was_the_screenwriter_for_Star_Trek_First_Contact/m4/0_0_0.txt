  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Star Trek: First Contact? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the screenwriter was Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, while Statement 2 claims that the screenwriter was only Ronald D. Moore. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, therefore they are contradictory."
