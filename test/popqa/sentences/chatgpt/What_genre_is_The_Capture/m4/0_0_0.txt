  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Capture are not contradictory. Both statements describe the same television series, but the second statement provides more specific details about the sub-genres within the broader category of thriller. The inclusion of \"British\" and \"mystery crime-drama\" further clarifies the setting and tone of the show. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the genre of The Capture."
