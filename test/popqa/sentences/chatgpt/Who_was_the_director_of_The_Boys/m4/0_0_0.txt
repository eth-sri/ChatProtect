  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Boys are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that while Dan Trachtenberg directed the pilot episode, Eric Kripke was the main director for the series. The second statement specifies that Trachtenberg directed the first season, which is consistent with the first statement as it falls under the umbrella of Kripke being the main director for the series. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the directors of The Boys."
