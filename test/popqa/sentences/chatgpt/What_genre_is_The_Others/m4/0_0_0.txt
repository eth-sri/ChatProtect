  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of The Others are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the film can be classified as a supernatural horror film, with the only difference being that the first statement adds the additional descriptor of \"psychological.\" This means that the film not only relies on supernatural elements to create fear and tension, but also explores the psychological aspects of its characters and their experiences. Therefore, both statements are valid and complement each other in describing the genre of The Others."
