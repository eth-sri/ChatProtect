  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Green Hell? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. Statement 1 claims that James Whale was the director of Green Hell, while Statement 2 claims that Umberto Lenzi was the director. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
