  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Sublime are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different variations of the same answer. Both statements agree that Sublime's genre is a blend of punk rock, reggae, and ska, with the second statement adding hip-hop to the mix. While the order of the genres may differ, both statements ultimately describe Sublime's unique sound as a fusion of multiple genres."
