  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Flawless? are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that Michael Radford was the director of the movie Flawless. The only difference is the use of parentheses in the first statement, which is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence."
