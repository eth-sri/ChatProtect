  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While the first statement emphasizes that the seminary is multi-denominational and affiliated with several Christian denominations, it does not exclude students from other religious backgrounds or traditions. The second statement further emphasizes this inclusivity by explicitly stating that the seminary is open to students of all faiths and backgrounds. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that the seminary is welcoming to a diverse range of students."
