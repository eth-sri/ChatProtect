  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the seminary is multi-denominational, meaning it accepts students and faculty from various religious backgrounds and does not adhere to a single religion. Statement 2 further clarifies that the seminary does not have an official religious affiliation, reinforcing the idea that it is not tied to any particular religion. Therefore, both statements support the notion that the seminary does not have a single religion or official religious affiliation."
