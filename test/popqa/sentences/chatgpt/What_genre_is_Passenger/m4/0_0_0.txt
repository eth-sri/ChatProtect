  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Passenger are not necessarily contradictory, but they do offer slightly different perspectives on his style. Both statements agree that Passenger is a singer-songwriter who incorporates elements of folk and indie music into his sound. However, the first statement emphasizes his acoustic and indie folk influences, while the second statement highlights his folk rock and indie pop style. These differences in emphasis may reflect varying interpretations of Passenger's music, but they do not necessarily contradict each other."
