  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Passenger are not contradictory. Both statements describe Passenger as a folk-pop singer-songwriter who is often classified under the indie folk genre. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 provides additional information about the acoustic genre, while statement 2 emphasizes the indie-folk classification. However, both statements ultimately convey the same genre classification for Passenger."
