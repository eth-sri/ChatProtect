  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Counter-Strike are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game and is often classified as a tactical shooter. The only difference is that the first statement adds that it can also be classified as a team-based shooter game. However, this does not contradict the second statement, as it still acknowledges that Counter-Strike is a tactical shooter."
