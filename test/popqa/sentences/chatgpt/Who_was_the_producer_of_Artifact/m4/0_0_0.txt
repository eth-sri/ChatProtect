  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Artifact? are not contradictory. The first statement refers to the producer of the documentary film Artifact, which is Jared Leto and Emma Ludbrook. The second statement refers to the digital collectible card game Artifact, which was developed and published by Valve Corporation. These are two separate entities with the same name, and therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
