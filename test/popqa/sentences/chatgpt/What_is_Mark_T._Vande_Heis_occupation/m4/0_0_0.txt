  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mark T. Vande Hei's occupation are contradictory. The reason being that both statements are identical and do not provide any additional information or clarification about his occupation. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether Mark T. Vande Hei's occupation is actually that of an astronaut or not based on these statements alone."
