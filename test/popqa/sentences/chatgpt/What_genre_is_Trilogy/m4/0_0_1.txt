The first statement explains that \"Trilogy\" is not a specific genre and can refer to a collection of works in any genre. The second statement clarifies that if the question is specifically about music, \"Trilogy\" is the title of an album by The Weeknd. Therefore, both statements provide different but complementary information about the topic."
