  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Iphicles are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that Amphitryon is Iphicles' father, while the second statement provides additional information about Iphicles' relationship to the Greek hero Heracles. The fact that Iphicles is Heracles' half-brother does not contradict the established paternity of Amphitryon."
