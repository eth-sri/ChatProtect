  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Iphicles are not contradictory. Statement 1 directly answers the prompt by stating that Amphitryon is the father of Iphicles, while statement 2 provides additional information about Amphitryon's status as a hero and his relationship with Alcmene. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Amphitryon is recognized as Iphicles' father in Greek mythology."
