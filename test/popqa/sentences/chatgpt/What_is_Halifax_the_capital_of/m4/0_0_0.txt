  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about \"What is Halifax the capital of?\" are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 clearly states that Halifax is the capital of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, while Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that Halifax is not a capital city. Although Statement 2 provides additional information about Halifax being a regional municipality and the largest city in Nova Scotia, it does not change the fact that Statement 1 identifies Halifax as the capital of the province. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
