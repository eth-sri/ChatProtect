  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there have been multiple producers involved in various adaptations of Treasure Island over the years, and therefore there is no single producer to credit for the story as a whole. Statement 1 emphasizes this point by stating that there is no one producer to credit, while Statement 2 highlights the fact that the story has been produced by many different people and companies."
