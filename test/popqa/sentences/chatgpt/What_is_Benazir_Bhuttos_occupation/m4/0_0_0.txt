  "explanation": "The two statements about Benazir Bhutto's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements identify her as a politician and a leader in Pakistan, with the second statement adding the descriptor \"stateswoman.\" The only difference is that the first statement specifically notes that she was the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, while the second statement does not mention her specific role. However, both statements ultimately convey the same information about her occupation as a politician and leader in Pakistan."
