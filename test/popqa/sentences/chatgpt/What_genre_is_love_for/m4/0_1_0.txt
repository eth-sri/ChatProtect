  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is love for?\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that love is not limited to a specific genre, while the second statement expands on this idea by stating that love can be found in various forms of art beyond just genres typically associated with love, such as romance. Both statements support the idea that love is a universal emotion that can be expressed in a variety of ways."
