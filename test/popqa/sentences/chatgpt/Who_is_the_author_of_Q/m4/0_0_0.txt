  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Q are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the author of Q is unknown and that there are many theories and speculations about their identity. The only difference is in the phrasing of the second statement, which emphasizes that the author remains unknown \"to this day.\" However, this does not contradict the first statement, which also acknowledges the ongoing debate and speculation surrounding the authorship of Q."
