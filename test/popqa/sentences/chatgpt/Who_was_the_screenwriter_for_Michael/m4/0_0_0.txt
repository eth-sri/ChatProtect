  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Michael? are not contradictory. They both provide the same answer, stating that Jim McGrath was the screenwriter for the movie Michael. The only difference between the two statements is the use of parentheses in the first one, which is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence."
