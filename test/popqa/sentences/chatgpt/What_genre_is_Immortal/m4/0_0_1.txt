  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Immortal are not contradictory. Statement 1 identifies Immortal as a black metal band, which is a specific subgenre of metal music. Statement 2 further specifies that black metal is a type of extreme metal, which encompasses a range of aggressive and intense subgenres within the broader category of metal music. Therefore, both statements are accurate and complementary in describing the genre of Immortal."
