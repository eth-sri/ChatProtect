  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of One Week? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that the producer of One Week is Michael McGowan, Avi Federgreen, and Nicholos de Pencier, while Statement 2 implies that the film was produced in 1920, which is almost 90 years before Michael McGowan, Avi Federgreen, and Nicholos de Pencier were even born. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true, and they contradict each other."
