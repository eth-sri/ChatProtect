  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Afonso II of Portugal are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information, with the only difference being the inclusion of the title \"Queen\" in the second statement. This does not change the identity of the mother, but rather adds additional information about her status. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
