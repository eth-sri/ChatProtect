  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Scooby-Doo are contradictory. Statement 1 lists only James Gunn and Craig Titley as the screenwriters for the 2002 live-action film, while Statement 2 adds James Greer to the list. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
