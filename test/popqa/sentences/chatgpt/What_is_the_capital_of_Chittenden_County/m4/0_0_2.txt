  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the capital of Chittenden County are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly states that Chittenden County does not have a capital as it is a county within the state of Vermont, which has Montpelier as its capital. Statement 2, however, incorrectly states that Burlington is the capital of Chittenden County. Burlington is the largest city in Chittenden County, but it is not the capital. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other."
