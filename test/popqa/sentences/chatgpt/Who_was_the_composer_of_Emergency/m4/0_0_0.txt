  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of Emergency are not contradictory. Both statements explain that it is not possible to determine the composer of Emergency due to different reasons. The first statement suggests that there are multiple songs, albums or scores with that title created by various artists, which makes it difficult to identify the specific composer. The second statement explains that the show did not have an original score and instead used stock music, which means that there was no specific composer for the music used in the show. Therefore, both statements provide valid reasons for why the composer of Emergency cannot be determined."
