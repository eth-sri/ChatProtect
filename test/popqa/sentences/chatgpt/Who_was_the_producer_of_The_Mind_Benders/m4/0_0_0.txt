  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of The Mind Benders are not contradictory. They both provide the same information and use the same wording. The only difference is the presence or absence of parentheses in the first statement, which does not affect the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, both statements convey the same information and are not contradictory."
