  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Troy? are not contradictory. Both statements identify Troy as an epic historical war drama film, with slight variations in the order of the descriptors. The first statement specifies that the film belongs to the subgenre of historical epic war films, while the second statement places equal emphasis on all three descriptors without specifying a subgenre. However, both statements ultimately convey the same genre classification for Troy."
