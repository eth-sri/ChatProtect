  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about who was the producer of Tarzan, the Ape Man are contradictory. The first statement claims that the 1981 film was produced by Bo Derek and her husband John Derek, while the second statement states that the movie was produced by MGM in 1932. These two statements refer to two different versions of the movie, one from 1981 and the other from 1932, and therefore have different producers."
