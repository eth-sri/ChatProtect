  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Wired? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that Wired is a magazine with multiple authors and is credited to Cond\u00e9 Nast. The second statement provides additional information about one of the co-founders of the magazine, Kevin Kelly, who is a well-known figure associated with Wired. Both statements are true and provide different perspectives on the authorship of Wired."
