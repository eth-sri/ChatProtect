  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Wired? are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that Wired is a magazine with multiple authors, while the second statement acknowledges that there are many writers and journalists associated with the publication. The first statement also highlights the role of Cond\u00e9 Nast as the credited publisher, while the second statement emphasizes the individuals who contribute to the magazine's content. Additionally, the first statement mentions Kevin Kelly's involvement in co-founding Wired, which is not contradicted by the second statement. Overall, the two statements provide complementary information about the authors of Wired."
