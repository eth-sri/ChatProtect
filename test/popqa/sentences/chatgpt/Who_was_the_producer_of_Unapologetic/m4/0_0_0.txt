  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Unapologetic? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 lists multiple producers who worked on the album, including Pop & Oak, David Guetta, Mike Will Made It, The-Dream, Labrinth, Ne-Yo, and Stargate. This suggests that the production of the album was a collaborative effort involving multiple individuals.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, identifies Kuk Harrell as the primary producer of Unapologetic. This implies that Harrell was the main creative force behind the album's production.\n\nTherefore, the two statements present different perspectives on the production of Unapologetic, with one emphasizing collaboration and the other highlighting the role of a single producer."
