  "explanation": "The statements about Todd Terry's genre are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his contribution to the development of house music, with statement 2 being more general and statement 1 specifically highlighting his role in the New York house scene of the 90s. Additionally, the text itself mentions that Todd Terry has worked in various genres, so the statements do not exclude the possibility of him being involved in other genres as well."
