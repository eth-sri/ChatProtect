  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Nine Inch Nails are not contradictory. Both statements mention additional genres that are sometimes associated with the band's music, but they do not contradict the initial statement that Nine Inch Nails is generally classified as industrial rock or alternative rock. The order in which the genres are listed may differ, but they are all genres that have been associated with Nine Inch Nails at some point."
