  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Christine are not contradictory. Both statements identify Bill Phillips as the screenwriter for the film, and both mention that the screenplay was based on the novel by Stephen King. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 mentions Bill Phillips first and then the source material, while Statement 2 mentions the source material first and then Bill Phillips."
