  "explanation": "The statements about Brad Delp's genre are not contradictory. Both statements agree that his genre can be classified as rock music. The first statement provides additional context by mentioning that Delp is known for being the lead vocalist of the rock band Boston, which further supports the classification of his genre as rock. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that Brad Delp's genre is rock."
