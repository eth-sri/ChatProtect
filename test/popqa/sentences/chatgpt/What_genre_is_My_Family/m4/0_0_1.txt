  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of My Family are not contradictory. Both statements identify My Family as a British sitcom and classify it as a comedy. The only difference is that the second statement specifies that it is a domestic comedy, which further narrows down the genre. Therefore, the statements are complementary and provide additional information about the specific type of comedy that My Family belongs to."
