  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Back to the Future are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale as the screenwriters, while Statement 2 only mentions Robert Zemeckis. Therefore, Statement 2 is a subset of Statement 1, as it only includes one of the two screenwriters mentioned in Statement 1. Both statements are true, but Statement 1 provides more information."
