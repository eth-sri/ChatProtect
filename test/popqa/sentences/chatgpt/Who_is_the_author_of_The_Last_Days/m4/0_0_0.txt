  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The Last Days? are contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Scott Westerfeld as the author of The Last Days, while Statement 2 incorrectly identifies Raymond Queneau as the author. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
