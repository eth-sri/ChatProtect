  "explanation": "The statements about \"What sport does penalty play?\" are not contradictory. Both statements agree that penalty is not a sport but a form of punishment used in various sports, including soccer and hockey. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which specifies the sports where penalty is used. However, both statements convey the same idea that penalty is not a sport but a disciplinary action in sports."
