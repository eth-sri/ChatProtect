  "explanation": "The statements about \"What sport does penalty play?\" are not contradictory. Both statements agree that penalty is not a sport but a method of punishment used in different sports. The only difference is that statement 2 provides examples of sports where penalty is used, while statement 1 does not. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
