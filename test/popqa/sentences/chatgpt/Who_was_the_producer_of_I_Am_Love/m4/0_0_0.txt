  "explanation": "The statements about the producer of I Am Love are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Tilda Swinton was the producer of the film. The only difference is the sentence structure and phrasing. Statement 1 uses a subject-verb-object structure while Statement 2 uses a passive voice structure. However, both statements have the same meaning and do not contradict each other."
