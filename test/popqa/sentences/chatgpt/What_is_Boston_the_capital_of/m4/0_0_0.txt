  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Boston the capital of?\" are not contradictory. Statement 1 correctly identifies Boston as the capital city of Massachusetts. Statement 2 acknowledges that while Boston is not a capital city in a broader sense, it is still the largest city in the state of Massachusetts. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about Boston's status as a city in Massachusetts."
