  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Gautama Buddha are not contradictory. Both statements identify the same person, Maya Devi, as the mother of Gautama Buddha. The only difference is that statement 2 includes the title \"Queen\" before Maya's name, which is not included in statement 1. However, this does not change the identity of Gautama Buddha's mother. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
