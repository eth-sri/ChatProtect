  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that while Lincoln was raised in a Baptist family and attended Presbyterian churches later in life, he never officially joined any church or declared a specific religious affiliation. Additionally, the second statement clarifies that Lincoln never formally joined a church or professed a belief in Jesus Christ, further emphasizing his lack of a clear religious identity. Overall, both statements support the idea that Lincoln's religious beliefs were complex and not easily defined by a specific label or affiliation."
