  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Lincoln did not officially join any church or declare a specific religious affiliation. The first statement simply provides information about his upbringing and attendance at Presbyterian churches later in life, while the second statement highlights the ongoing debate among historians about his personal beliefs. Overall, both statements support the idea that Lincoln's religious views were complex and not easily categorized."
