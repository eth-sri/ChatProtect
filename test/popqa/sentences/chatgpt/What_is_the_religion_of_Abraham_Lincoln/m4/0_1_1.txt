  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Lincoln never officially joined any church or declared an affiliation with any particular religion. The first statement provides additional information about his upbringing and attendance at Presbyterian churches, but ultimately confirms that he did not have a formal religious affiliation."
