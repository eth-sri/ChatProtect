  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Abraham Lincoln are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Lincoln had some connection to Christianity, specifically Baptist and Presbyterian denominations, but also that he did not officially join any particular denomination. The first statement emphasizes his secular beliefs, while the second statement focuses on his attendance at Protestant churches. Overall, both statements provide a nuanced understanding of Lincoln's religious background."
