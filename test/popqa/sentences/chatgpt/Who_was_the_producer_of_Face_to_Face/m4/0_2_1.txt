  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Face to Face are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Michael Peacock produced the final season after Hugh Burnett, while Statement 2 claims that John Freeman produced the final season. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about who produced the final season of the show."
