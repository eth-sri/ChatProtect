  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of Face to Face are contradictory as they provide different names for the producer of the final season. Statement 1 claims that Michael Peacock produced the final season, while statement 2 claims that John Freeman produced the final season. Therefore, it is unclear who the actual producer of the final season was."
