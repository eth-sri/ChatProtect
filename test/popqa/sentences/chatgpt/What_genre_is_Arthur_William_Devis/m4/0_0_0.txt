  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Arthur William Devis are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Devis was a portrait painter, with one specifying that his works predominantly belonged to the genre of portraiture and the other stating that he was an English portrait painter. Therefore, both statements support the idea that Devis was primarily a painter of portraits."
