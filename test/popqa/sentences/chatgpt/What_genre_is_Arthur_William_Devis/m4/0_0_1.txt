  "explanation": "The two statements about the genre of Arthur William Devis are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same idea that Devis was a portrait painter and his works primarily belonged to the genre of portraiture. The only difference is in the wording, where the first statement uses the phrase \"predominantly belonged to the genre of portraiture\" while the second statement directly states that his works belonged to the genre of portrait painting. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Devis as a portrait painter."
