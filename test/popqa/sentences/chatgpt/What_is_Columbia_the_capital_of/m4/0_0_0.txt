  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Columbia the capital of?\" are not contradictory. The first statement correctly identifies Columbia as the capital city of South Carolina in the United States. The second statement clarifies that if the question was intended to ask about the capital of the country Colombia, it is Bogot\u00e1. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about different locations and do not contradict each other."
