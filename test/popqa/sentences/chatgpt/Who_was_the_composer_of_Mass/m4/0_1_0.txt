  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of Mass? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there have been various composers throughout history who have written Mass compositions. The only difference is that statement 1 lists more composers than statement 2, but they both include some of the same well-known composers such as Bach and Mozart. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
