  "prefix": " In Islam, Jesus (referred to as Isa) is considered to be a prophet and messenger of God, but not the son of God or a divine figure. Islam recognizes Jesus as a messenger who taught monotheism and morals to his followers. He is also believed to have performed miracles such as healing the sick and raising the dead by the permission of God.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Jesus is not worshipped as a deity in Islam, while the second statement acknowledges his importance as a prophet and messenger of God, second only to Muhammad. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief that Jesus is a significant figure in the religion, but not divine."
