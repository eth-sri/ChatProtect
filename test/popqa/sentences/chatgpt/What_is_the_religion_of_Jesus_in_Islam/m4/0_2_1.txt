  "explanation": "The two statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Jesus is believed to have performed miracles with the permission of God. The only difference is that statement 2 clarifies that the miracles were such as healing the sick and raising the dead. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the Islamic view of Jesus."
