  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that Jesus is believed to have performed miracles, but they differ in the explanation of how he performed them. Statement 1 suggests that Jesus performed miracles with the permission of God, while Statement 2 suggests that he performed them through the power of God. However, both statements ultimately attribute the miracles to God and do not contradict the Islamic belief that Jesus was a prophet and messenger of God."
