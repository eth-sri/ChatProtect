  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, but not as the son of God or a divine figure. The first statement highlights Jesus' teachings of monotheism and morals, while the second statement emphasizes that Jesus is an important prophet but not divine. Together, these statements provide a clear understanding of the Islamic perspective on Jesus' role in religion."
