  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements support the idea that Jesus is a prophet and messenger of God in Islam who taught monotheism and performed miracles by the permission of God. The second statement further emphasizes Jesus' belief in the oneness of God and his message of submission to God's will, which aligns with Islamic beliefs. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the religion of Jesus in Islam."
