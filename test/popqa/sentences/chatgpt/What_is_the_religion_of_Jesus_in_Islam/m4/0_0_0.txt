  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Jesus in Islam are not contradictory. Both statements affirm that Jesus is considered a prophet in Islam, but not the son of God or a divine figure. Statement 1 further clarifies that Jesus is only considered a messenger of God, while Statement 2 simply affirms his status as a prophet. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the Islamic belief about the religion of Jesus."
