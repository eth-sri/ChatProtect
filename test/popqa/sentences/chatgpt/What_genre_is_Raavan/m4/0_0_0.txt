  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Raavan? are contradictory. Statement 1 describes Raavan as a psychological thriller and drama film, while Statement 2 describes it as an action-adventure film. While both statements mention that Raavan is an epic film and in Hindi language, the genres mentioned are different. Psychological thriller and drama are more focused on character development and emotions, while action-adventure is more focused on action and adventure. Therefore, the two statements cannot be describing the same genre of the film."
