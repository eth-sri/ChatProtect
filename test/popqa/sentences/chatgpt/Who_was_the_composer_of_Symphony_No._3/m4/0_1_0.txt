  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the composer of Symphony No. 3?\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there are multiple symphonies with the same title, while the second statement provides examples of composers who have written a Symphony No. 3. Both statements do not provide a definitive answer to the question of who specifically composed Symphony No. 3, but rather offer general information about the existence of multiple compositions with the same title and composers who have written them."
