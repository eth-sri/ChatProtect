  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for North & South are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter. Statement 1 claims that Sandy Welch was the screenwriter, while statement 2 claims that Douglas Heyes was the screenwriter. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
