Both statements clarify that the Assumption of Mary is not a separate religion but rather a belief held within Christianity, specifically Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one includes Orthodox Christianity as well, while the first one only mentions Catholicism."
