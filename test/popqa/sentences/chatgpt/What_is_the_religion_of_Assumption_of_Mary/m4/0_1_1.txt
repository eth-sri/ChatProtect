  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Assumption of Mary are not contradictory. Statement 1 clarifies that the Assumption of Mary is not a separate religion but rather a belief within Christianity, specifically Catholicism. Statement 2 further explains that this belief is not widely accepted in other Christian denominations, indicating that it is a specific belief within a particular religion rather than a universal belief across all of Christianity. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the religious context of the Assumption of Mary."
