  "explanation": "The statements about who was the composer of \"Let It Be\" are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Paul McCartney was the composer of the song, but the first statement adds that it was credited to both McCartney and John Lennon, which was a common practice for all Beatles songs. Therefore, the first statement provides additional information about the song's credits, but it does not contradict the second statement."
