Statement 1 correctly identifies the overall genre of the game as shoot 'em up, while statement 2 provides additional information about the specific subgenre of shoot 'em up that Touhou Project falls under, which is danmaku. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete understanding of the game's genre."
