  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Touhou Project are not contradictory. Both statements describe Touhou Project as a bullet hell shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Team Shanghai Alice. The only difference is that the first statement uses the singular form \"video game\" while the second statement uses the plural form \"video game series\". However, this difference does not change the overall description of the genre of Touhou Project."
