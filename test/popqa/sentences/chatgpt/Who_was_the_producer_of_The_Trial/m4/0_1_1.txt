  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there have been multiple adaptations of The Trial, and therefore the producer of each adaptation may differ. The second statement specifically refers to the 1962 film adaptation and identifies Orson Welles as the director, not the producer. Therefore, both statements are providing different information and are not in conflict with each other."
