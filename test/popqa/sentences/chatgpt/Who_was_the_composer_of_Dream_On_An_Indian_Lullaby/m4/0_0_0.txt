  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the composer of Dream On (An Indian Lullaby) are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the composer's name starts with the initials \"A.R.\", while Statement 2 identifies the composer as George Gershwin, who is not associated with those initials. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
