  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Career? are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter of the movie \"Career\". One statement says it was Carl Foreman, while the other says it was James Lee Barrett. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct and further research is needed to determine the actual screenwriter for the movie."
