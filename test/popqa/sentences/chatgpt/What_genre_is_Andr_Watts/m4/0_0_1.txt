  "explanation": "The statements about What genre is Andr\u00e9 Watts? are not contradictory. Both statements describe Andr\u00e9 Watts as a classical pianist who is known for his performances of works by composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Liszt. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that he is particularly known for his interpretations of Romantic-era composers such as Chopin and Liszt. However, this does not contradict the fact that he is a classical pianist who also performs works by other composers."
