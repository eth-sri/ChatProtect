Statement 1 acknowledges that there are multiple films and TV shows with the same title, which makes it difficult to specify the screenwriter for a particular production of \"Desire.\" Statement 2 provides information about a specific screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, who has worked on multiple productions with his writing and adaptation skills. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
