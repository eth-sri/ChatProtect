  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that there are multiple films and TV shows with the same title, which makes it difficult to determine the specific screenwriter for the film in question. The second statement acknowledges this fact and states that it cannot generate a sentence to fill the gap as the answer has already been provided. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
