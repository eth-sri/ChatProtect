  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Desire? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there are multiple films and TV shows with the same title, which makes it difficult to determine the screenwriter without specifying which one is being referred to. The second statement further emphasizes this point by noting that there are actually two movies titled \"Desire\" with different screenwriters, highlighting the need for clarification. Both statements are consistent in their recognition of the ambiguity surrounding the question."
