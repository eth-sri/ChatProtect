  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Zeni Geva are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Zeni Geva is an experimental rock band from Japan and is often associated with noise rock and industrial genres. The only difference is that the first statement adds avant-garde metal to the list of associated genres, while the second statement does not. However, this difference does not contradict the overall classification of Zeni Geva as an experimental rock band with a focus on noise and industrial music."
