  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Oil? are contradictory. The first statement refers to the 2007 film \"There Will Be Blood,\" while the second statement states that the screenwriter for \"Oil\" was Upton Sinclair, who was a writer and not involved in the making of the 2007 film. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
