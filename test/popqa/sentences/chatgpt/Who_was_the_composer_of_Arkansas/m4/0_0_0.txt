  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the composer of Arkansas?\" are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that there is no specific composer of the state song \"Arkansas\", which may have been assumed based on the prompt. The second statement points out that Arkansas is not a musical composition and therefore cannot have a composer. Both statements provide different perspectives on the prompt and do not contradict each other."
