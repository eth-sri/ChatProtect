  "explanation": "The two statements about the location of Criuleni in the Republic of Moldova are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Criuleni is a town situated in the Republic of Moldova. The only difference is the use of the word \"located\" in the second statement, which adds emphasis to the fact that Criuleni is situated in the Republic of Moldova. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but rather convey the same information in slightly different ways."
