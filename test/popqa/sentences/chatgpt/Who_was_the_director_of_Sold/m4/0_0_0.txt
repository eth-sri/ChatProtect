  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Sold are not contradictory. Both statements identify Jeffrey D. Brown as the director of the movie \"Sold\". The only difference is that the second statement specifies the name of the movie, while the first statement does not. Therefore, both statements convey the same information and are consistent with each other."
