  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Arena? are contradictory. While both statements mention Nigel Finch and Anthony Wall as producers of the show, their order is different in each statement. Statement 1 lists Nigel Finch first, while Statement 2 lists Anthony Wall first. Additionally, Statement 1 includes Mark Bell as a producer, while Statement 2 includes Alan Yentob. Therefore, the order and inclusion of producers in each statement contradicts the other."
