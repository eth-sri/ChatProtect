  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that chalk is typically white or off-white in color, but the second statement adds that colored chalk also exists for writing or drawing. The second statement does not contradict the first statement, but rather expands upon it by mentioning a specific use for chalk beyond its typical color. Additionally, the second statement does not make any claims about the color of chalk, but rather its purpose. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
