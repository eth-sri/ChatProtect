The first statement establishes that chalk is typically white or off-white in color, while the second statement adds that chalk can also come in various colors depending on the type of rock it is made from. The third statement further expands on this by mentioning that colored chalk is also available for writing or drawing. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about the color of chalk without contradicting each other."
