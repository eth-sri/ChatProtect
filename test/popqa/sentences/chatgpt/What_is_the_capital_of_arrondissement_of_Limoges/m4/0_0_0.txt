The prompt asks for the capital of the arrondissement of Limoges, but statement 1 clarifies that Limoges is not an arrondissement, but rather a commune and the capital of the Haute-Vienne department. Statement 2 provides additional information about Limoges being a city in central France, but does not address the prompt directly."
