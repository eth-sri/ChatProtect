  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Prestige are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan as the screenwriters, while Statement 2 only mentions Christopher Nolan. Therefore, Statement 2 is a subset of Statement 1, and both statements can be true at the same time."
