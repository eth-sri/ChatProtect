The first statement describes Celebration as a genre of music that incorporates funk, soul, and disco elements, while the second statement specifies that Celebration is a song by Madonna that falls under the dance-pop and disco-pop genres. Both statements provide different perspectives on the genre of Celebration, with the first statement being more general and the second statement being more specific to the Madonna song."
