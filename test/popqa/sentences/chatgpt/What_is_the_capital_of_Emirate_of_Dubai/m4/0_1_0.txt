  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but they are not relevant to the prompt. The prompt specifically asks for the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, not the capital of the United Arab Emirates. The first statement in the text correctly explains that Dubai does not have a capital as it is one of the seven emirates, but the two following statements provide information about the capital of the UAE, which is not what the prompt is asking for."
