Statement 1 clarifies that Dubai does not have a capital as a standalone entity, while Statement 2 specifies that the city of Dubai serves as the capital of the Emirate of Dubai within the larger framework of the United Arab Emirates. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the capital of Emirate of Dubai."
