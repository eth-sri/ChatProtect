  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the father of Faunus? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that there are two possible fathers of Faunus in Roman mythology - Pluto and Mars. However, Statement 2 directly contradicts this by stating that the father of Faunus is believed to be Mars alone. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
