  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Survivor? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the composers of \"Survivor\" are Frank Sullivan and Jim Peterik, while Statement 2 only mentions Frank Sullivan as the composer. Therefore, Statement 1 includes Jim Peterik as a composer, while Statement 2 does not. This contradiction suggests that there may be some uncertainty or disagreement about who exactly composed \"Survivor.\""
