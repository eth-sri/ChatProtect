  "explanation": "The statements about the director of Hell on Wheels are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the show was directed by multiple directors, and they both list some of the notable directors who worked on the show. The only difference is that Statement 1 includes Terry McDonough, while Statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the fact that the show had multiple directors."
