  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Grand Slam? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the television series Grand Slam did not have a single producer, but rather had multiple production companies and people involved in its production over the course of its run. The only difference between the two statements is that statement 1 specifies that there were different executive producers for each season, while statement 2 simply states that multiple people were involved in the production."
