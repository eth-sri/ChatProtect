  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Treasure Island are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more detailed description of the novel's genre, including its classification as historical fiction and its intended audience of children and young adults. Statement 2 simply identifies the novel as an adventure novel, which is a broader genre category that Treasure Island falls under. Both statements are accurate and complement each other in providing a fuller understanding of the novel's genre."
