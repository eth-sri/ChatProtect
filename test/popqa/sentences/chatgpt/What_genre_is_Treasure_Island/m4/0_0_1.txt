  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Treasure Island are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Treasure Island is a novel of adventure and historical fiction. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that it is commonly classified as a children's and young adult novel, while statement 2 adds that it is commonly classified as a classic of children's literature. These additional classifications do not contradict the main genre of the novel."
