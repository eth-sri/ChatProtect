Statement 1 provides an answer to the question assuming that \"Ryan\" refers to a short film produced by the United States government. Statement 2 acknowledges that there may be a mistake in the prompt and requests clarification on the correct movie title. Therefore, both statements are valid and do not contradict each other."
