  "explanation": "The statements about who is the author of Norma are not contradictory. Both statements agree that Vincenzo Bellini is the composer of the opera Norma. However, statement 1 adds that Felice Romani is the librettist, which means the person who wrote the text or lyrics for the opera. Therefore, statement 1 provides additional information about the creative team behind the opera Norma."
