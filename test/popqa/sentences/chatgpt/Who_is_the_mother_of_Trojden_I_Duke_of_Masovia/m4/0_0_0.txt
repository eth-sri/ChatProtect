  "explanation": "The statements about the mother of Trojden I, Duke of Masovia are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the name of Trojden I's mother is unknown. The only difference is the inclusion of the Duke of Masovia title in the first statement, which is not relevant to the information being conveyed. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
