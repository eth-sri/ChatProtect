While they provide different information about the origins of the award, they both agree that it is not associated with a specific country and is instead a recognition of contributions to Orthodox Christianity and Slavic culture. The only difference is in the namesake of the award, with one statement referring to the brothers as \"Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius\" and the other as \"the Byzantine brothers Cyril and Methodius.\""
