  "explanation": "The statements about the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius are not contradictory. The text explains that the order is not tied to a specific country, but rather is an honorary order established by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Statement 1 provides additional information about the origins of the award, while Statement 2 describes the physical appearance of the medal and ribbon. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius is not associated with a particular country."
