  "explanation": "The statements about Ski Beatz's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements describe him as a music producer, with the second statement adding that he is also a record producer and disc jockey. While the second statement provides more specific information about his role in the music industry, it does not contradict the first statement. Therefore, both statements can be true simultaneously."
