  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Masks? are contradictory because they provide different names for the director of the film. Statement 1 claims that Craig Mazin was the director, while Statement 2 claims that Andreas Marschall was the director. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
