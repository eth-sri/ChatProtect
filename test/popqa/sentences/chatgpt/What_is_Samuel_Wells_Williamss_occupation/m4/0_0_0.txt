  "explanation": "The statements about Samuel Wells Williams's occupation are not contradictory. Both statements agree that he was a linguist and a missionary. The only difference is that the first statement adds that he was also a sinologist, which is a scholar of Chinese language, culture, and history. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide accurate information about Samuel Wells Williams's occupation."
