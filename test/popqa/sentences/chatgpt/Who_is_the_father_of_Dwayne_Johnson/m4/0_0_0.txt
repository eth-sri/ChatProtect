  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information about the father of Dwayne Johnson, stating that his name is Rocky Johnson and that he was a professional wrestler who is now retired or former. The only difference is the use of the words \"retired\" and \"former,\" which have the same meaning in this context. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
