  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Esau are not contradictory. Both statements identify Rebekah/Rebecca as the mother of Esau, with the second statement providing additional information about her role as the wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob as well. The only difference between the two statements is the spelling of Rebekah/Rebecca, which is a minor variation and does not change the meaning of the statement. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
