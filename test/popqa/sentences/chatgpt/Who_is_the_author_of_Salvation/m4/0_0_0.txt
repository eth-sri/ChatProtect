  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Salvation? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there are multiple works of literature with the title \"Salvation\" and therefore multiple authors who have written works with this title. The second statement specifies that the \"Salvation\" being referred to is a science fiction novel written by Peter F. Hamilton. Therefore, both statements can be true simultaneously without contradicting each other."
