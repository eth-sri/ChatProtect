Statement 1 claims that Chrome was primarily developed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, while Statement 2 claims that it was primarily developed by Jeff Nelson and Lars Bak. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they present different sets of individuals as the primary contributors to the development of Chrome."
