  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Snake? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that there are multiple authors who have written works titled \"The Snake,\" making it impossible to determine the specific author of the text in question. On the other hand, Statement 2 claims that \"The Snake\" was written by John Steinbeck, which contradicts the idea that there are multiple authors who have written works with the same title. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
