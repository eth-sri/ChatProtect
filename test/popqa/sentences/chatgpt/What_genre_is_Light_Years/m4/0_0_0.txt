  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Light Years? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 identifies Light Years as a science fiction novel, while Statement 2 identifies it as a work of literary fiction. Science fiction and literary fiction are two distinct genres with different characteristics and conventions. While science fiction typically involves speculative or futuristic elements, literary fiction tends to focus on character development and exploring complex themes. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
