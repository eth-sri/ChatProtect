Both statements correctly identify Medve\u0161\u010dak as a neighborhood in the city of Zagreb, which is located in Croatia. The only difference between the two statements is that the second statement adds that Zagreb is the capital of Croatia, which is an additional piece of information but does not contradict the first statement."
