  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of The Secret Life of Plants? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the authors of the book are Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, while Statement 2 only mentions Peter Tompkins as the author. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
