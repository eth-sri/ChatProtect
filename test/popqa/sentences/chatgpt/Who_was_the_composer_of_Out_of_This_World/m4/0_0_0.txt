  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"Out of This World\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Harold Arlen is the composer, while statement 2 claims that Cole Porter is the composer. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
