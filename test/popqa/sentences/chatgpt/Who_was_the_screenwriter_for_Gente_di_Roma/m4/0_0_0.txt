  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Gente di Roma? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. One statement claims that Federico Fellini was the screenwriter for the film, while the other statement claims that Sergio Amidei was the screenwriter. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
