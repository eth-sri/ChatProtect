  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of The City? are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple works with the title \"The City\" by different authors, and therefore the question of who the author is cannot be answered without further clarification. Statement 1 uses the word \"any\" to emphasize the wide range of possibilities, while statement 2 specifies that there are \"several\" books with that title. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that the question is too broad to be answered definitively without more information."
