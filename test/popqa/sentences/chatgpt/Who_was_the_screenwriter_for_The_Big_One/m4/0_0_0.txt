  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Big One? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Michael Moore both directed and wrote the documentary film The Big One, implying that he was the screenwriter. On the other hand, statement 2 only mentions that Michael Moore directed the film, without any mention of him being the screenwriter. Therefore, the two statements present conflicting information about the screenwriting credit for The Big One."
