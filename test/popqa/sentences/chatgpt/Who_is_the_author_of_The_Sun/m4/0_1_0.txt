While statement 1 specifically mentions the current owner and editor of The Sun, it also acknowledges that the newspaper has had various authors and editors throughout its history. Statement 2 simply reiterates this fact without providing any specific information about the current author or editor. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
