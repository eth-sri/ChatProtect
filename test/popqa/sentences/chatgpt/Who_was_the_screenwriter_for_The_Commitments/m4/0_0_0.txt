  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Commitments? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the screenwriters for The Commitments were Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, while Statement 2 claims that the screenwriter was only Dick Clement. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they are contradictory."
