  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is Dasht Jeyhun?\" are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same message that there is no country with the name Dasht Jeyhun. The only difference is in the wording, where one statement uses the word \"named\" and the other uses the word \"called\". However, both words have the same meaning in this context and do not change the overall message. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
