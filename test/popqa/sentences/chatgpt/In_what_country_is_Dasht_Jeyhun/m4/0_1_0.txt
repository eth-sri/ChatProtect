Both statements provide additional information about the meaning and translation of the term \"Dasht Jeyhun\" but do not contradict the initial statement that there is no country named Dasht Jeyhun. The term refers to a geographical feature, specifically a plain located along the Jeyhun or Amu Darya river, rather than a political entity."
