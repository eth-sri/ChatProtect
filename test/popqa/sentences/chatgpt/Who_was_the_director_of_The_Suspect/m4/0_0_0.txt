  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Suspect? are contradictory because they provide different names for the director of the film. Statement 1 claims that Stuart Orme directed the film, while Statement 2 claims that Robert Siodmak directed it. Since both statements cannot be true at the same time, they contradict each other."
