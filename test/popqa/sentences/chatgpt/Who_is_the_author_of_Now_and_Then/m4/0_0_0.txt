  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Now and Then? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author is Jacqueline Sheehan, while statement 2 claims that the author is William Corlett. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct, making the statements contradictory."
