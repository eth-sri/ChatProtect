  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of The Rock? are not contradictory. They both provide the same information that Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were the producers of the movie. The only difference is the use of parentheses in the first statement, which is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence."
