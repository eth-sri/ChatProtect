  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. Both statements describe the duo as being from Germany and using electronic instruments in their music. The first statement simply refers to them as a pop music duo, while the second statement specifies that they are a synth-pop duo, which is a subgenre of pop music that heavily features synthesizers. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional information about the specific subgenre of pop music that Modern Talking belongs to."
