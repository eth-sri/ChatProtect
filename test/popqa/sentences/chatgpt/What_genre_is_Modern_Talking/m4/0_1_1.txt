  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the genre that best describes their music is Euro disco or Europop. The only difference is in the wording, with the first statement using \"best describes\" and the second statement using \"primarily classified as.\" However, both statements convey the same idea that Euro disco or Europop is the genre that Modern Talking's music falls under."
