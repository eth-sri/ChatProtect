  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Modern Talking are not contradictory. Both statements describe the same genre, which is Euro disco or Europop. The only difference is that statement 2 uses the term \"Eurodisco\" as a single word, while statement 1 separates it into two words. However, this does not change the meaning or genre being described."
