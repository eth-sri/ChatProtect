  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Descendants? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the screenwriting credits for The Descendants belong to three individuals - Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash. On the other hand, Statement 2 suggests that only Alexander Payne was the screenwriter for the movie. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
