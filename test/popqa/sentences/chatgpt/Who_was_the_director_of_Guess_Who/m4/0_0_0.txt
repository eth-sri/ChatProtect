Both statements convey the same information that Kevin Rodney Sullivan directed the movie \"Guess Who\". The only difference is the way the information is presented. Statement 1 uses a more concise sentence structure while Statement 2 provides additional context by specifying that \"Guess Who\" is a movie."
