  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of Instant Crush? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Daft Punk, a French electronic music duo, composed Instant Crush. However, Statement 2 contradicts this by stating that Julian Casablancas, the lead singer of The Strokes, composed the song. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
