  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Suicide?\" are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that suicide is not a genre, but rather a sensitive and serious issue that should not be treated as entertainment. The first statement explicitly states that suicide is not considered a genre of entertainment, while the second statement implies the same idea by stating that a serious issue like suicide cannot be considered a genre. Therefore, both statements are consistent in their message."
