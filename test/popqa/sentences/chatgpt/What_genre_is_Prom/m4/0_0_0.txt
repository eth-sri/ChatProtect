  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Prom are not contradictory. Statement 2 simply adds the element of drama to the teen romantic comedy genre mentioned in Statement 1. It is possible for a movie to belong to multiple genres, and in this case, Prom can be classified as both a romantic comedy and a drama."
