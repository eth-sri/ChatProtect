  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Marathon are not contradictory. The first statement identifies it as an action game, while the second statement specifies that it is also a science fiction game. These two genres can overlap, as many science fiction games involve action-packed gameplay. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
