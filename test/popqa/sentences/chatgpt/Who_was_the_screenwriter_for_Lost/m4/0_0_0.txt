  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for Lost are not contradictory, but rather offer different levels of detail. Statement 1 provides the two primary screenwriters for the show, while Statement 2 expands on that to include two additional writers who also contributed to the show's creation. Both statements are accurate and true, but Statement 2 simply provides more information."
