  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of All Around the World? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the song was composed by three individuals - Lisa Stansfield, Ian Devaney, and Andrew Morris. On the other hand, Statement 2 suggests that the song was solely composed by Lisa Stansfield. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
