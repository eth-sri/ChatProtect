  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is The One? are contradictory. The first statement describes The One as a science fiction thriller novel, while the second statement describes it as a science fiction television series. While both statements identify The One as science fiction, they differ in their medium - one is a novel and the other is a television series. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
