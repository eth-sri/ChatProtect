  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Secretary? are contradictory because they provide different names for the producer of the film. Statement 1 claims that Andrew Fierberg was the producer, while statement 2 claims that Steven Shainberg was the producer. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be correct."
