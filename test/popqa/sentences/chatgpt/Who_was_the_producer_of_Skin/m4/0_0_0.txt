  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Statement 1 acknowledges that there are two different films with the same title, and therefore the producer could refer to either one. Statement 2 expands on this idea by noting that there are even more works with the same title, making it possible for there to be multiple producers associated with the title \"Skin.\" Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
