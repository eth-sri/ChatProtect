  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Taken? are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen were the screenwriters for the film Taken. The only difference is the use of quotation marks in the second statement, which is a matter of style and does not change the meaning of the statement."
