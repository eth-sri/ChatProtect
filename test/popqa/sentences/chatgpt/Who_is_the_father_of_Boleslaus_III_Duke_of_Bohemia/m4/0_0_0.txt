  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information and agree on the identity of Boleslaus III's father, which is Vladivoj, Duke of Bohemia. The only difference between the two statements is the use of a comma before the name of the Duke of Bohemia in the second statement, which is a matter of style and does not affect the meaning of the sentence."
