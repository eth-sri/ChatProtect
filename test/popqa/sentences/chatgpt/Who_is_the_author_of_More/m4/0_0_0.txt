  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of More? are contradictory. Both statements suggest that the author of More cannot be determined without additional context, but they do not provide any further information or clarification. However, the use of identical language in both statements implies that they are meant to convey the same meaning, which contradicts the idea that the author can be determined with additional context."
