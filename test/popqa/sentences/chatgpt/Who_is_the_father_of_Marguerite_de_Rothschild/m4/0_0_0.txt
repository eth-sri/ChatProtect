  "explanation": "The statements about who is the father of Marguerite de Rothschild are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Edmond de Rothschild is her father, while statement 2 claims that Baron Henri James de Rothschild is her father. Since they are two different individuals, they cannot both be her father. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
