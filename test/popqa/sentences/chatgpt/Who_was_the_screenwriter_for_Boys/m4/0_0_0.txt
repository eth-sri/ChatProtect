  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Boys? are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter of the same film. One statement claims that Tathagata Singha was the screenwriter for Boys, while the other statement claims that Rohit Banawlikar was the screenwriter. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is accurate and further research is needed to determine the correct answer."
