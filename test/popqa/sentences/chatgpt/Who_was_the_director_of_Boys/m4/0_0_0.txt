  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the director of Boys?\" are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that there are multiple films with the title \"Boys\" and therefore multiple directors who could be referred to as the director of \"Boys\". The first statement simply states that the director of \"Boys\" could refer to different films, while the second statement expands on this by specifying that there are multiple movies with that title directed by different people. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
