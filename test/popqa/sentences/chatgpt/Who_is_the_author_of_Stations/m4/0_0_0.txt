  "explanation": "The statements about the author of Stations are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author is Rohith Vemula, while statement 2 claims that the author is Barry N. Malzberg, a science fiction writer. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, they are contradictory."
