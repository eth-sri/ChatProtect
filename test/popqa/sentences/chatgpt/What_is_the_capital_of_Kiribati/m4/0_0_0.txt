  "explanation": "The statements about the capital of Kiribati are not contradictory. Both statements are correct, as South Tarawa is a district within the larger Tarawa atoll, which serves as the capital of Kiribati. Therefore, both \"South Tarawa\" and \"Tarawa\" can be considered correct answers to the question \"What is the capital of Kiribati?\" depending on the level of specificity required."
