  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. Both statements identify Tachibana no Moroe as a Japanese poet who lived during the Heian period. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that he was also a government official, while statement 2 adds that he was a nobleman. These are not mutually exclusive categories, as it was common for noblemen to also hold government positions during the Heian period. Therefore, both statements can be true and do not contradict each other."
