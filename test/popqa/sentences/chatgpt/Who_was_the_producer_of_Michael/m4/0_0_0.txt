  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of Michael? are contradictory because they provide different names for the producer of the 1996 film Michael. One statement says it was Steven Reuther, while the other says it was David Nicksay. Therefore, it is unclear which producer was actually responsible for the film."
