While the prompt asks for the director of Burning Man, the first statement clarifies that the festival is not directed by a single person but rather by a community of volunteers. The second statement provides additional information about the organization that oversees the festival, which is the Burning Man Project. Therefore, both statements provide relevant information about the organization and management of Burning Man."
