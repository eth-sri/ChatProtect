  "explanation": "The statements about who was the director of Burning Man are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the Burning Man festival does not have a single director, but statement 1 adds that Larry Harvey played a significant role as a co-founder and \"chief philosophic officer\" until his death. Statement 2 further clarifies that Harvey served as the de facto director, meaning he was not officially appointed as the director but played a leadership role in the festival's organization. Therefore, both statements provide additional information about Harvey's involvement in the festival without contradicting each other."
