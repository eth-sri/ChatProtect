  "explanation": "The two statements about \"What is Hamilton the capital of?\" are not contradictory. They both state that Hamilton is the capital of Bermuda, with the only difference being the inclusion of the word \"city\" in the first statement. However, this does not change the meaning of the statement and both convey the same information."
