  "explanation": "The statements about the genre of Disorder are not necessarily contradictory, as a film can belong to multiple genres. In this case, Disorder can be classified as both a psychological thriller and a drama, as it contains elements of both genres. The psychological thriller aspect is evident in the tense and suspenseful atmosphere, while the drama aspect is seen in the exploration of the main character's personal struggles and relationships. Therefore, both statements can be true and accurate descriptions of the film's genre."
