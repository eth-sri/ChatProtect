  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Warning? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Warning as an album belonging to the alternative rock and progressive rock genres, while Statement 2 describes Warning as a song by the punk rock band Green Day. Alternative rock and progressive rock are different genres from punk rock, so the two statements cannot both be true."
