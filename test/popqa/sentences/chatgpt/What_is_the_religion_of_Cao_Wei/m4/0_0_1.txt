  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the religion of Cao Wei are contradictory. Statement 1 clearly states that Cao Wei had an official religion that was a blend of Confucianism, Taoism, and ancestor worship. On the other hand, statement 2 claims that Cao Wei did not have an official religion. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
