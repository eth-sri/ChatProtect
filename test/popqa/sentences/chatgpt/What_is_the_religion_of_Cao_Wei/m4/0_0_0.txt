Statement 1 explains that the official religion of Cao Wei was a combination of Confucianism, Taoism, and ancestor worship, while Statement 2 simply provides context about Cao Wei being a state during the Three Kingdoms period in ancient China. The two statements do not contradict each other and can both be true simultaneously."
