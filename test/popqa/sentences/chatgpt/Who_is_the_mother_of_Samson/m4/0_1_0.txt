  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Samson are not contradictory. Both statements agree that the mother of Samson is not named in the Bible and is only referred to as either the wife of Manoah or Samson's mother. The difference between the two statements is the specific way in which she is referred to, but they do not contradict each other."
