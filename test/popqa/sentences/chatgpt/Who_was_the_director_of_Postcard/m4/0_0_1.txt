  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the director of Postcard?\" are not contradictory. The first statement simply states that information about the specific movie named \"Postcard\" is not available, which means that there is no answer to the question. The second statement acknowledges that the first statement is not a valid answer to the question and asks for clarification or a different question. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
