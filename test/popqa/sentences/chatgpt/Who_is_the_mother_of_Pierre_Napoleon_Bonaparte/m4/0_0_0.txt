  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that his mother's name was Justine Bonaparte, while Statement 2 claims that her name was Justine Eleanore Ruflin. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different names for the same person. Therefore, they are contradictory."
