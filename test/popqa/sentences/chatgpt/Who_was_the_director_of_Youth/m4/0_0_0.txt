  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Youth? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Paolo Sorrentino was the director of the movie Youth. The only difference is the presence or absence of parentheses in the first statement, which does not change the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the statements are consistent and not contradictory."
