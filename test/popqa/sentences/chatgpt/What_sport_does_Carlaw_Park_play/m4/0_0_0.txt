  "explanation": "The statements about \"What sport does Carlaw Park play?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about the location and purpose of Carlaw Park, but do not specify which sport was played there. The first statement simply states that it was a former sports stadium, while the second statement describes it as a multi-purpose stadium. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which sport was played at Carlaw Park based on these statements alone."
