  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What sport does Carlaw Park play? are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Carlaw Park was used to play multiple sports including rugby league, rugby union, soccer, and others. However, statement 2 contradicts this by stating that Carlaw Park was only used to play rugby league. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
