  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Adam? are contradictory because they provide different answers to the same question. One statement claims that Max Mayer was the screenwriter for Adam, while the other statement claims that Ariel Schrag was the screenwriter for Adam. Since they cannot both be true, the statements contradict each other."
