  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for Evening? are contradictory because they provide different names for the screenwriter of the movie. One statement says it was Michael Cunningham, while the other says it was Susan Minot. Therefore, it is unclear which statement is correct and further research is needed to determine the actual screenwriter for Evening."
