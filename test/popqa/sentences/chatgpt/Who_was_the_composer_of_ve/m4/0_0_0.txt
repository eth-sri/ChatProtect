  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the composer of \u00c8ve? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Jules Massenet is the composer of \u00c8ve, while statement 2 claims that Michel Legrand is the composer of \u00c8ve. Since they are two different composers, the statements cannot both be true at the same time."
