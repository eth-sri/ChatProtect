  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Pearl? are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that the author of Pearl is unknown, while the second statement provides additional information about the poem itself, stating that it is a medieval English alliterative poem and part of an anonymous 14th-century manuscript known as the Pearl Poet. Therefore, both statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
