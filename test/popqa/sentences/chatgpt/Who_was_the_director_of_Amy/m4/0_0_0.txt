  "explanation": "The statements about \"Who was the director of Amy?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same answer to the prompt and only differ in their use of punctuation. Statement 1 includes parentheses around the year of the film's release, while Statement 2 does not. However, both statements clearly identify Asif Kapadia as the director of the documentary film Amy."
