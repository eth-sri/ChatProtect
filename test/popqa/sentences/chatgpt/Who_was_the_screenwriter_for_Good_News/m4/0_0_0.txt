  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for Good News? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the screenwriter was Jack McGowan, with additional dialogue by Laurence Schwab and B.G., while Statement 2 claims that the screenwriter was Betty Comden and Adolph Green. These are two different sets of names, and therefore cannot both be true."
