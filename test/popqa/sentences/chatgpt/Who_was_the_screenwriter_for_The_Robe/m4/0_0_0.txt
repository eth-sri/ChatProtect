  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Robe are contradictory. Statement 1 lists three screenwriters for the film, including Gina Kaus, Albert Maltz, and Philip Dunne, while statement 2 only lists Albert Maltz as the screenwriter. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
