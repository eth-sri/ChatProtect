  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of The Comic? are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information and identify Carl Reiner as the director of the film. The only difference is the inclusion of the phrase \"a 1969 American comedy film\" in the first statement, which provides additional context but does not contradict the second statement."
