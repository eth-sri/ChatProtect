  "explanation": "The statements about \"In what country is National Assembly?\" are not contradictory. Both statements address the issue of the question being too broad and unclear. The first statement simply states that the question is too vague, while the second statement asks for clarification on which specific country's National Assembly is being referred to. Both statements suggest that the question needs to be more specific in order to provide a clear answer."
