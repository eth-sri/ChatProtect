  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Shelter? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Harlan Coben is the author of Shelter, while statement 2 claims that Jung Yun is the author. Since they are two different names, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
