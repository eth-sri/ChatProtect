  "explanation": "The statements about Whitney Houston's genre are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that she is primarily a pop artist, but also has elements of R&B, soul, and gospel in her music. The second statement simply adds that she has also been classified specifically as a pop and R&B artist. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide a more complete understanding of Whitney Houston's genre."
