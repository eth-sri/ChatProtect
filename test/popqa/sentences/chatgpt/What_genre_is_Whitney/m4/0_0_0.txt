  "explanation": "The statements about \"What genre is Whitney?\" are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different perspectives. Statement 1 acknowledges that Whitney Houston's music has been classified under multiple genres, including pop, R&B, soul, and gospel. Statement 2, on the other hand, emphasizes that her music is primarily classified as R&B and pop. While there may be some overlap between the two statements, they do not contradict each other."
