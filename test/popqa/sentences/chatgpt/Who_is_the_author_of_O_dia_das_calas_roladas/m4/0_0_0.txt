  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of O dia das cal\u00e7as roladas? are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the author is Roberto Drummond, while statement 2 claims that the author is Ana Maria Machado. Since they are two different authors, they cannot both be correct. Therefore, the statements contradict each other."
