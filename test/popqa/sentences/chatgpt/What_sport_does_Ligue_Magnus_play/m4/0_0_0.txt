  "explanation": "The statements about \"What sport does Ligue Magnus play?\" are not contradictory. Both statements provide accurate information about Ligue Magnus, stating that it is a professional ice hockey league in France. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one specifies that it is a men's league, while the first statement does not. However, this does not contradict the first statement, as it is still true that Ligue Magnus is a professional ice hockey league in France."
