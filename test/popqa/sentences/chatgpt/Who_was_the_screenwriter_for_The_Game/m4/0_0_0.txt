  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Game? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the screenwriters for The Game were John Brancato and Michael Ferris, while Statement 2 only mentions John Brancato as the screenwriter. Therefore, Statement 1 includes Michael Ferris as a co-screenwriter, while Statement 2 does not. This contradiction suggests that one of the statements may be incorrect or incomplete."
