  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Salisbury the capital of?\" are not contradictory, but rather present two different perspectives. Statement 1 acknowledges that the question can have multiple answers depending on the context, implying that Salisbury may be a capital city in some contexts but not in others. Statement 2, on the other hand, asserts that Salisbury is not a capital city, indicating that it is not a capital city in any context. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but rather offer different interpretations of the question."
