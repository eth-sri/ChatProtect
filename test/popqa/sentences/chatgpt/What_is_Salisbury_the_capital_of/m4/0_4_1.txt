  "explanation": "The statements about \"What is Salisbury the capital of?\" are not contradictory. The first statement acknowledges that there are multiple possible answers to the question depending on the context, and provides two examples. The second statement simply adds another possible answer, which is that Salisbury is the name of a cathedral city in Wiltshire, England. None of the statements claim that Salisbury is the capital of any particular country or region, so there is no contradiction between them."
