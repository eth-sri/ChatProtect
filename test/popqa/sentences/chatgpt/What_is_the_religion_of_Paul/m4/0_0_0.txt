  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Paul are not contradictory. The first statement establishes that Paul was originally a Jew, while the second statement indicates that he became an apostle of Jesus Christ after his conversion to Christianity. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and provide a more complete understanding of Paul's religious background and beliefs."
