While the first statement establishes Paul's religious background as a Jew before his conversion to Christianity, the second statement highlights his significant role in the early Christian church after his conversion. The third statement further emphasizes his contribution to the Christian faith through his writings in the New Testament. Both statements provide complementary information about Paul's religious identity and his impact on the development of Christianity."
