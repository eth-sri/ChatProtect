  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. While Paul was originally a devout Jew, his conversion to Christianity led him to become a prominent figure in the early Christian church and play a significant role in spreading its teachings. This ultimately made him one of the most influential figures in the early development of Christianity. Therefore, both statements are consistent with the idea that Paul's religion changed from Judaism to Christianity."
