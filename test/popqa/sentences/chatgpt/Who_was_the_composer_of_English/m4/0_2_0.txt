  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of English? are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that the English language was not created by a single composer or individual. They both highlight the fact that the English language evolved over time from various sources and influences. Therefore, they are consistent in their message that the English language is a product of historical and cultural evolution rather than a single composer's creation."
