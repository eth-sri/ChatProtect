  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge that the English language did not have a single composer, but rather evolved over time through a combination of various influences. The sources and influences mentioned in each statement may differ slightly, but they both support the idea that the English language is the result of a complex historical and linguistic process rather than the work of a single individual."
