  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the composer of English? are not contradictory. Both statements agree that there is no single composer of the English language. The first statement explicitly states that there is no composer, while the second statement explains that English has evolved through the contributions of many people, indicating that it is not the work of a single composer. Therefore, both statements support the idea that English is a language that has developed over time through the contributions of many individuals."
