  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the producer of What's Going On? are not contradictory. Both statements identify Marvin Gaye as the producer of the album. However, the second statement provides additional information about the co-producers Lawrence Miles and Renaldo Benson, who worked alongside Marvin Gaye on the production of the album. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
