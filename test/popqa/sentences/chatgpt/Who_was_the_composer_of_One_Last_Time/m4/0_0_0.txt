  "explanation": "The statements about the composer of \"One Last Time\" are not contradictory. Both statements identify Lin-Manuel Miranda as the composer of the song and mention that it was created for the Hamilton musical. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Hamilton is a hit Broadway musical, while statement 1 does not include that detail."
