  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about What genre is Working? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 describes Working as a musical genre that combines various styles, while Statement 2 describes it as a non-fiction book written by Studs Terkel. These two descriptions are not compatible with each other, as one refers to a type of music and the other to a literary work. Therefore, they cannot both be true at the same time."
