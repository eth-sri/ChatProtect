  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. They both provide the same answer to the prompt \"What is the capital of Cagayan?\" but use slightly different phrasing. Statement 1 uses \"Tuguegarao City\" as the name of the capital, while Statement 2 uses \"the city of Tuguegarao.\" However, both statements convey the same information and are therefore not contradictory."
