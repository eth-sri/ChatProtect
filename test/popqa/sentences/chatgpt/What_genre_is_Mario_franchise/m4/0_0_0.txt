  "explanation": "The two statements about the genre of the Mario franchise are not contradictory. Both statements essentially convey the same idea that the Mario franchise belongs to the platforming genre. The only difference is that the first statement specifies that it is a platforming video game genre, while the second statement simply states that it is a platformer game. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
