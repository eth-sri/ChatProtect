  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the producer of Revenge? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 claims that Mike Kelley was the sole creator and producer of Revenge, while Statement 2 states that the show was produced by Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that Mike Kelley was involved in the creation of the show but did not produce it, while Bowen and Godfrey took over as producers at a later point. However, without further information, it is unclear which statement is accurate."
