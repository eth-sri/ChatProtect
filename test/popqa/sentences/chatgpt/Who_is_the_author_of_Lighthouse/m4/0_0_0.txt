  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Lighthouse? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is no specific author of Lighthouse, as it is a general term. However, Statement 2 directly contradicts this by stating that Virginia Woolf is the author of a novel titled Lighthouse. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
