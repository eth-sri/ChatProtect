  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the author of Lighthouse? are not contradictory. Both statements clarify that \"Lighthouse\" is a general term and not a specific book or author. Statement 1 emphasizes that there is no single author of Lighthouse, while Statement 2 specifies that there is no author of a book titled \"Lighthouse.\" Both statements are consistent with the initial text that establishes Lighthouse as a general term."
