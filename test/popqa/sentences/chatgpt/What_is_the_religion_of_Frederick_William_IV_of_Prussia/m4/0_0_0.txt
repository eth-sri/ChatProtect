  "explanation": "The statements about the religion of Frederick William IV of Prussia are not necessarily contradictory, but they do present different levels of specificity. Statement 1 identifies him as a member of the broader Protestant faith, while Statement 2 specifies that he was a devout Lutheran within that faith. Therefore, Statement 2 provides more detail about his specific beliefs within the larger Protestant denomination mentioned in Statement 1."
