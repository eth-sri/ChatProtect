Statement 1 correctly identifies Verny (now known as Almaty) as the former capital of Semirechye Oblast and modern-day Kazakhstan until 1997. Statement 2 provides additional information that Verny was also the former name of the current largest city in Kazakhstan, Almaty. Both statements are accurate and do not contradict each other."
