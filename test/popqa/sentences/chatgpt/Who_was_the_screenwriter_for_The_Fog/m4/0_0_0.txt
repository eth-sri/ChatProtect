  "explanation": "The statements about who was the screenwriter for The Fog are not contradictory. Statement 1 includes both John Carpenter and Debra Hill as the screenwriters, while Statement 2 only mentions John Carpenter. Therefore, Statement 2 is a subset of Statement 1, as it only includes one of the two screenwriters mentioned in Statement 1."
