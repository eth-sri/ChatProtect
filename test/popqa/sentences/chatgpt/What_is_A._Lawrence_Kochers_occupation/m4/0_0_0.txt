  "explanation": "The statements about A. Lawrence Kocher's occupation are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides a more comprehensive answer, stating that he was not only an architect but also a writer and editor. Statement 2, on the other hand, focuses solely on his occupation as an architect. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
