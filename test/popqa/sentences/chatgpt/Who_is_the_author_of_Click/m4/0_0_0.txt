  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who is the author of Click? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that the screenplay for Click was written by three authors - Adam Sandler, Tim Herlihy, and Steve Koren. On the other hand, Statement 2 suggests that Adam Sandler is the sole author of Click. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, hence they are contradictory."
