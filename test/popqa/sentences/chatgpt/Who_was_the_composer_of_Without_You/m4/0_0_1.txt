  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the composer of \"Without You\" are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Harry Nilsson is the composer, while Statement 2 claims that it was composed by Pete Ham and Tom Evans of the band Badfinger. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that there are different versions or covers of the song, with different composers credited, but the statements as written are contradictory."
