  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the director of Look? are not contradictory. Statement 1 lists some of the notable directors who worked on Look over the years, while Statement 2 adds to that list by mentioning Stanley Kubrick specifically as a director who worked on the program in the 1950s. Both statements acknowledge that there were multiple directors who worked on Look, and Statement 2 provides a specific example of one of those directors."
