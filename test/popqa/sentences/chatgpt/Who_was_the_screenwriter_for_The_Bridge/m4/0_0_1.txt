  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Bridge? are not contradictory. The first statement clarifies that The Bridge, being a documentary, did not have a traditional screenwriter. The second statement acknowledges that it cannot generate a sentence for a prompt that is not related to the initial question about the screenwriter for The Bridge. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
