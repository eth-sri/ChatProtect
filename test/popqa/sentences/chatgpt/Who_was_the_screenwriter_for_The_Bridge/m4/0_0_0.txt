  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Bridge? are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 suggests that The Bridge did not have a screenwriter, while Statement 2 implies that there was a screenwriter involved in the creation of the Swedish-Danish crime television series. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
