  "explanation": "The statements about Who was the screenwriter for The Bridge? are not contradictory. While the first statement clarifies that the documentary did not have a traditional screenwriter, it provides information about the individuals who directed and edited the film. The second statement simply reiterates that the film was directed by Eric Steel. Both statements are consistent with each other and provide different pieces of information about the production of The Bridge."
