  "explanation": "The statements about who is the mother of Mahavira are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information that Mahavira's mother's name was Trishala. The only difference is that statement 1 also includes the additional information that Trishala was a queen. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and do not contradict each other."
