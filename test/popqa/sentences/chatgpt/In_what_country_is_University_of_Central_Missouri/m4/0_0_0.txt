  "explanation": "The statements about the location of the University of Central Missouri are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that the university is situated in the United States. The only difference is in the wording, where the first statement specifies the full name of the country, while the second statement uses a shortened version. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and convey the same message."
