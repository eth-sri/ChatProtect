  "explanation": "The statements about who was the producer of El Cid are not contradictory. They both provide the same answer, stating that Samuel Bronston was the producer of the film. The only difference between the two statements is the use of parentheses in the first one, which is simply a formatting choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence."
