  "explanation": "The statements about Who is the father of Islamic view of Isaac are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the Islamic view of Isaac has developed over time through the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and Islamic scholars, and there is no singular \"father\" of this view. The second statement provides additional information about Isaac's role as a prophet in Islam and his relationship to Ibrahim (Abraham), which is consistent with the Islamic view of Isaac as it has developed over time."
