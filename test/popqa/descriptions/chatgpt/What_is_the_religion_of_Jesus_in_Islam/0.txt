  "prompt": "What is the religion of Jesus in Islam?",
  "text": "In Islam, Jesus (referred to as Isa) is considered to be a prophet and messenger of God, but not the son of God or a divine figure. Islam recognizes Jesus as a messenger who taught monotheism and morals to his followers. He is also believed to have performed miracles such as healing the sick and raising the dead by the permission of God. In Islam, Jesus is regarded as a significant figure but not worshipped as a deity.",
