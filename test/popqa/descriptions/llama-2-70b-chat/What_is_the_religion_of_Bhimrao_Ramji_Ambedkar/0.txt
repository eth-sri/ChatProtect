  "text": "Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was a Indian polymath and social reformer who played a significant role in the drafting of India's constitution and the fight against social injustice against the lower castes. He was born in a Maharashtrian Dalit family and was raised in a Hindu tradition. However, he was critical of Hinduism and its caste system, and he eventually embraced Buddhism.\n\nIn 1956, Ambedkar converted to Buddhism, along with many of his followers, as a way to escape the discrimination and inequality faced by lower castes in Hinduism. He believed that Buddhism offered a more egalitarian and rational approach to religion and society, and he saw it as a way to challenge the caste system and promote social justice.\n\nAmbedkar's conversion to Buddhism was a significant event in Indian history and had a profound impact on the social and political landscape of the country. It marked a turning point in the struggle for civil rights and social justice, and it paved the way for the empowerment of marginalized communities.\n\nToday, Ambedkar's legacy continues to be celebrated and revered by millions of people across India, and his teachings and philosophy continue to inspire social and political movements for justice and equality.",
