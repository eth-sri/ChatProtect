  "text": "The authorship of the Q source is not definitively known and is the subject of ongoing scholarly debate. Q is a hypothetical source that is thought to have been used by the authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke in the composition of their works. It is believed that Q was a Greek-language text that contained a collection of sayings and teachings of Jesus, as well as some narrative material.\n\nThere are several theories about the authorship of Q, but no consensus has been reached. Some scholars believe that Q was written by a single author, while others propose that it was compiled from multiple sources by a editor or redactor. Some have suggested that Q was written by a group of authors or editors working together, while others propose that it was the work of a single individual.\n\nSome scholars have proposed identifying the author of Q with one of the known figures from early Christianity, such as the apostle Matthew or the evangelist Luke. However, these theories are not widely accepted, and the majority of scholars agree that the authorship of Q is unknown.\n\nIn summary, the authorship of Q is a subject of ongoing debate and research among scholars, and there is currently no consensus on the identity of the author or authors of this hypothetical source.",
