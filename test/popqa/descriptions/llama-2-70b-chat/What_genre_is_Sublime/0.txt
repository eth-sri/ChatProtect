  "prompt": "What genre is Sublime?",
  "text": "Sublime is a band that is difficult to pin down to a single genre. Their music incorporates elements of various styles, including ska, punk, reggae, hip hop, and rock. They are often categorized as a ska punk band, but their sound is diverse and has evolved over time.\n\nThe band's early work was heavily influenced by the Southern California ska scene, and their debut album, \"40oz. to Freedom,\" released in 1992, is often characterized as a ska album. However, their subsequent albums, such as \"Robbin' the Hood\" (1994) and \"Self-Titled\" (1996), saw the band expanding their sound to incorporate elements of punk, alternative, and even acoustic music.\n\nThe band's lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell, was known for his eclectic musical tastes and his ability to blend different styles into his songwriting. As a result, Sublime's music often defies easy categorization, and they have been described as everything from a ska band to a punk band to a reggae band.\n\nUltimately, Sublime's genre is best described as a fusion of various styles, with a strong foundation in ska and punk, but incorporating elements of other genres as well. Their music is often referred to as \" alternative rock\" or \"third wave ska,\" but it is ultimately a unique blend that is distinct from any single genre.",
