  "text": "The author of \"Visionseeker: Shared Wisdom from the Place of Refuge\" is not explicitly stated. The book is a collection of wisdom teachings and stories from the indigenous elders and spiritual leaders of North America, compiled and edited by a person or group of people who are not identified in the text. The lack of attribution to a specific author is deliberate, as the book is intended to be a representation of the collective wisdom of the indigenous elders and spiritual leaders, rather than a work written by a single individual.",
