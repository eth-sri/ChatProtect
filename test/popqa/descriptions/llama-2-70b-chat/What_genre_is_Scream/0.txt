  "text": "Scream is a horror movie. More specifically, it's a slasher film, which is a subgenre of horror that typically involves a masked killer stalking and murdering a group of people, often teenagers or young adults. Scream, however, also incorporates elements of satire and self-awareness, which sets it apart from more traditional slasher films. It's often referred to as a \"slasher-comedy\" or a \"horror-comedy\" because of its blend of horror and dark humor.",
