  "text": "The producer of the 1959 film The Bat was Cousin C.C. (or Cardinal C.C.) Capades. Capades was a wealthy and reclusive film producer who was known for his eccentric behavior and his penchant for producing low-budget horror films. In the film, he is portrayed by actor Agnes Moorehead, who was a well-known actress and radio personality at the time. The character of Cousin C.C. Capades was likely inspired by the real-life figure of Val Lewton, a horror film producer who worked at RKO Pictures during the 1940s and 1950s.",
