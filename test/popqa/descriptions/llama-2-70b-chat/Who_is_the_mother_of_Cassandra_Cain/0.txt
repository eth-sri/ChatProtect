  "prompt": "Who is the mother of Cassandra Cain?",
  "text": "The mother of Cassandra Cain is inconclusive in the DC Comics universe. There is no definitive answer to who her mother is, as her origin story has been revamped and retconned multiple times over the years.\n\nIn some versions, Cassandra's mother is shown to be a woman named Sandra Wu-San, who was a skilled martial artist and assassin. However, this origin story has been largely retconned and is no longer considered part of Cassandra's official backstory.\n\nIn other versions, Cassandra's mother is either unnamed or unrevealed. Her father, David Cain, is often portrayed as a solitary figure who trained her in martial arts and weapons from a young age, but her mother's identity is rarely mentioned or explored.\n\nIn short, there is no definitive answer to who Cassandra Cain's mother is in the DC Comics universe, as her backstory has been subject to multiple revisions and retcons over the years.",
