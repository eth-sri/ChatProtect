  "prompt": "What is the capital of arrondissement of Limoges?",
  "text": "I'm not sure what you mean by \"arrondissement of Limoges.\" Limoges is a city in France, and it is the capital of the Haute-Vienne department. However, France does not have administrative divisions called \"arrondissements\" at the national level. Instead, the country is divided into 18 administrative regions, each of which contains several departments.\n\nIf you meant to ask about the capital of the Haute-Vienne department, the answer is Limoges. If you have any further questions or clarifications, please let me know!",
