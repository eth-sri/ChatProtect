  "text": "The producer of the album \"Images\" by Jean Michel Jarre was Jean Michel Jarre himself. He is a French composer, performer and record producer, who is known for his pioneering work in the field of electronic music and ambient music.\n\n\"Images\" was released in 1976 and it was Jarre's third studio album. It was a departure from his previous work, as it featured more visual and atmospheric elements, and it was the first album where Jarre used the theme of \"sonic paintings\" or \"musical landscapes\", which would become a characteristic of his later work.\n\nJarre produced the album himself, and he also played all the instruments and created all the sound effects on the album. He used a variety of electronic instruments, such as the Moog synthesizer, the VCS3 synthesizer, and the Mellotron, as well as traditional instruments like the piano and the guitar.\n\nThe album was recorded at Jarre's own studio, the \"Auditorium\" in Paris, France, and it was released on the Disques Dreyfus label. It was a critical and commercial success, and it is considered one of Jarre's best works, showcasing his unique blend of electronic music and ambient soundscapes.",
