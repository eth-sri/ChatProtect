  "text": "Prince Lasha is a genre-bending artist who blends elements of funk, rock, R&B, and hip-hop to create a unique sound that is difficult to categorize. However, if I had to choose a genre for Prince Lasha, I would say that his music is generally classified as alternative R&B or experimental R&B, as it often incorporates elements of soul, funk, and electronic music, while also pushing the boundaries of traditional R&B and pop conventions.",
