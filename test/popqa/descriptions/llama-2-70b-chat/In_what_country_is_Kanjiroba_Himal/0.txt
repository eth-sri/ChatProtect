  "text": "Kanjiroba Himal is not a real mountain, but rather a fictional one created for a fantasy story. Therefore, it is not located in any specific country or region. The name \"Kanjiroba Himal\" is derived from the Japanese word \"kanji\" (\u6f22\u5b57) and the Nepali word \"Himal\" (\u0939\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0932), which means \"mountain\" in Nepali. The name is meant to evoke a sense of cultural blending and mystery, reflecting the diverse cultural influences that shape the story's setting.",
