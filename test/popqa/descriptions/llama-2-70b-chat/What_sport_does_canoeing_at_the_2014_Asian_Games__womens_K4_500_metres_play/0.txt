  "text": "Canoeing at the 2014 Asian Games \u2013 women's K-4 500 metres is a form of sprint kayaking, which is a sub-discipline of canoeing. In sprint kayaking, athletes compete in a straight line over a set distance, typically 200m or 500m, in a single-person or multi-person boat. The \"K-4\" in the name refers to the fact that there are four paddlers in the boat. The sport is also known as flatwater sprint canoeing or kayaking.",
