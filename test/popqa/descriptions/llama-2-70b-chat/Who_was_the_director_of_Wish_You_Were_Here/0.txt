  "text": "The director of the 1975 film \"Wish You Were Here\" was Syd Barrett. Barrett was a founding member of the band Pink Floyd, and \"Wish You Were Here\" was his final work with the band before his departure due to mental health issues. The film was a surreal and experimental work that explored themes of absence, distance, and the fragility of human connection. It was not a commercial success at the time of its release, but has since become a cult classic and is now considered a pioneering work of psychedelic cinema.",
