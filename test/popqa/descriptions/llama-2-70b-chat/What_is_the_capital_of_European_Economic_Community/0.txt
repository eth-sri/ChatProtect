  "prompt": "What is the capital of European Economic Community?",
  "text": "The European Economic Community (EEC) was a predecessor to the European Union (EU) and did not have a capital in the classical sense. The EEC was a supranational organization that was established in 1958 and operated until 1993, when it was replaced by the European Union.\n\nDuring its existence, the EEC did not have a single capital city. Instead, it had three official seats of government: Brussels, Belgium (the administrative center), Strasbourg, France (the official seat of the European Parliament), and Luxembourg (the location of the European Court of Justice).\n\nTherefore, there was no single capital of the European Economic Community.",
