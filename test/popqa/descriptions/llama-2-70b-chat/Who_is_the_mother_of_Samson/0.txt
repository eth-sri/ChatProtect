  "text": "The mother of Samson is not explicitly named in the biblical account of Samson's life. She is referred to as \"his father's wife\" or \"his mother\" in the biblical text. According to the story, Samson was born to a woman who was barren and had been unable to conceive children. She was visited by an angel of the Lord who announced that she would give birth to a son who would be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from birth. The boy was born, and his mother named him Samson, which means \"strong\" or \"mighty\" in Hebrew.",
