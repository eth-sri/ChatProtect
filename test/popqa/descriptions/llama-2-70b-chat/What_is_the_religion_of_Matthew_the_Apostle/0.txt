  "prompt": "What is the religion of Matthew the Apostle?",
  "text": "The religion of Matthew the Apostle is not explicitly stated in the New Testament or other historical sources. However, it is generally believed that Matthew, also known as Levi, was a Jewish tax collector before he became a follower of Jesus Christ.\n\nMatthew's Gospel, which he is traditionally believed to have written, does contain references to Jewish customs, laws, and traditions, suggesting that he was familiar with Jewish practices and beliefs. Additionally, Matthew's Gospel emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and presents Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, which suggests that Matthew had a Jewish background and was writing to a Jewish audience.\n\nTherefore, while we cannot say with certainty what religion Matthew the Apostle followed, it is likely that he was a Jewish Christian, meaning that he was a Jew who had accepted Jesus as the Messiah and followed his teachings.",
