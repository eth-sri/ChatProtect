  "text": "In Roman mythology, Faunus is the son of the god Pan. Pan is a god of the wild, shepherds, and fertility, and is often depicted with the upper body of a man and the lower body of a goat. He is known for his wild and lascivious nature, and is often associated with sexuality and fertility. Faunus, as the son of Pan, would inherit some of these characteristics and be associated with similar aspects of nature and fertility.",
