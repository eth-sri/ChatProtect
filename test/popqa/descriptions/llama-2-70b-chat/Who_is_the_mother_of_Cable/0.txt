  "prompt": "Who is the mother of Cable?",
  "text": "The mother of Cable, a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe, is not explicitly stated in the comics or other official sources. However, based on the character's backstory and various hints throughout the comics, it is heavily implied that Cable's mother is Jean Grey, also known as Phoenix.\n\nCable's father, Scott Summers (Cyclops), had a romantic relationship with Jean Grey, and it is suggested that Cable was conceived during this time. However, Jean's death and subsequent resurrection as the Phoenix complicated the timeline, and it is not clear whether Cable was born before or after her death.\n\nFurthermore, Cable's powers and abilities are linked to the Phoenix Force, which is a powerful energy that has been passed down through Jean's family line. This connection suggests a strong genetic link between Cable and Jean, supporting the theory that she is his mother.\n\nWhile there has been no definitive confirmation from Marvel Comics, the hints and clues throughout the comics and other media suggest that Jean Grey is indeed Cable's mother.",
