  "prompt": "Who is the author of The Pianoplayers?",
  "text": "The author of The Pianoplayers is Anthony Burgess. The novel was first published in 1986 and is a satirical exploration of the relationship between music, violence, and morality. It tells the story of a group of piano players who are engaged in a series of bizarre and often disturbing performances, and explores themes of art, identity, and the human condition. The Pianoplayers is considered one of Burgess's most challenging and experimental works, and is often seen as a critique of the excesses of late 20th-century society.",
