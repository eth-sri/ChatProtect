  "prompt": "What genre is Shaft?",
  "text": "Shaft is a 1971 American blaxploitation crime film directed by Gordon Parks and written by Ernest Tidyman. It is considered a prime example of the blaxploitation genre, which emerged in the early 1970s and was characterized by low-budget, independently produced films that were aimed at African American audiences and often featured black actors in leading roles. The film is also considered a classic of the action and crime genres.\n\nThe blaxploitation genre was defined by its focus on African American characters and themes, as well as its often controversial and politically charged content. The films were often criticized for their graphic violence, sexuality, and negative portrayals of African Americans, but they were also praised for their cultural relevance and for providing opportunities for black actors and filmmakers.\n\nShaft is a key example of this genre, with its iconic protagonist, John Shaft, played by Richard Roundtree, becoming a symbol of black empowerment and cool. The film's success helped to establish the blaxploitation genre and paved the way for other films, such as Super Fly and The Mack, which also explored similar themes and characters.\n\nOverall, Shaft is a blaxploitation film that combines elements of crime, action, and drama to create a cult classic that continues to be celebrated for its cultural significance and enduring popularity.",
