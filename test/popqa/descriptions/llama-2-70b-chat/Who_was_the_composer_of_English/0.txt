  "text": "It is not accurate to say that there was a single \"composer\" of the English language. English has evolved over time through a process of linguistic change, and it has been influenced by various languages, including Old English, Middle English, and Latin.\n\nThe development of Modern English is credited to several factors, including the Norman Conquest of 1066, the introduction of the printing press in the 15th century, and the spread of English as a global language in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThere have been many influential linguists, lexicographers, and writers throughout history who have contributed to the development and standardization of English. Some notable figures include:\n\n* King Alfred the Great, who commissioned translations of Latin texts into Old English in the 9th century\n* Chaucer, who wrote The Canterbury Tales in Middle English in the 14th century\n* William Caxton, who introduced the printing press to England in the 15th century and published many influential books in English\n* Samuel Johnson, who published the first English dictionary in 1755\n* Noah Webster, who published an influential dictionary of American English in 1828\n\nThese individuals, among others, have played a significant role in shaping the English language as we know it today. However, it is important to note that the development of a language is a collective process, and it involves the contributions of many people over time.",
