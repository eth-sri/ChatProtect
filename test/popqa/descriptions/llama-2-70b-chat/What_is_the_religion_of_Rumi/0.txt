  "text": "Rumi, also known as Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad R\u016bm\u012b, was a 13th-century Persian poet, scholar, and Sufi mystic. He was born in present-day Afghanistan and lived most of his life in Konya, Turkey. Rumi's religion was Islam, and he was a devout follower of the Shia branch of Islam.\n\nRumi's spiritual legacy is still celebrated widely today, and his teachings have been influential in Islamic spirituality and mysticism. His poetry and writings include many references to Islamic theology, ethics, and spiritual practices, and they reflect his deep devotion to God and his love for the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nHowever, Rumi's spiritual views were not limited to Islam alone. He believed in the unity of all religions and the universal message of love and spirituality that underlies them. He saw God as the ultimate reality that transcends all religious boundaries and believed that the spiritual path is a personal journey towards union with God.\n\nRumi's poetry often expresses a sense of inner longing and yearning for God, and his teachings emphasize the importance of love, compassion, and service to humanity. His spirituality was deeply rooted in the Islamic tradition, but his message of love and unity continues to resonate with people of all faiths and backgrounds.",
