  "prompt": "Who is the author of Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum?",
  "text": "The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) is a collection of Latin inscriptions from the Roman Empire, published in a series of volumes by the German Archaeological Institute (Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut, DAI) since 1863. The CIL was founded by Theodor Mommsen, who was a philologist and historian, and it has been edited by a number of scholars over the years.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to attribute the authorship of the CIL to a single person. Instead, it is a collaborative project that has been worked on by many scholars over time.",
