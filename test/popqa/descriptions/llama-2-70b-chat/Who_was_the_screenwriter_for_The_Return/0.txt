  "text": "The screenwriter for the 2017 film \"The Return\" is not explicitly stated. The film was directed by Lawrence Michael Levine, who is also credited as the writer. However, the film's screenplay was largely improvised by the cast, with the actors contributing to the dialogue and story development through a collaborative process. Therefore, while Levine may have had a hand in shaping the overall narrative and theme of the film, the exact amount of input he had in the screenplay is difficult to determine.",
