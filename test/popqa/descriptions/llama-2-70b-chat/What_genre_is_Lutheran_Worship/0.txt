  "text": "Lutheran worship is a form of Christian worship that is typical of Lutheran churches. It is characterized by a liturgical style that is based on the teachings of Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition.\n\nLutheran worship typically includes a variety of elements, such as hymns, prayers, scripture readings, and a sermon. The liturgy is often structured around the liturgical season, with different variations for different Sundays and holy days throughout the year.\n\nIn terms of music, Lutheran worship has traditionally featured a strong emphasis on choral music, with choirs and congregational singing playing a prominent role in many Lutheran churches. Hymns and chorales are often accompanied by organ or piano, and may also include other instruments such as trumpets, trombones, and handbells.\n\nIn terms of genre, Lutheran worship music is often classified as sacred music or religious music, and is generally considered to be a subgenre of classical music. However, it has also been influenced by a variety of other musical styles over the centuries, including folk, medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque music.\n\nSome notable composers of Lutheran worship music include Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann, and Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, among others. Some well-known Lutheran hymns include \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,\" \"Luther's Cradle Hymn,\" and \"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded.\"",
