  "text": "The author of The City is not explicitly stated. The book is considered a sacred text in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, and its authorship is attributed to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the faith. However, the book is not a single authored work, but rather a collection of texts and writings that were revealed by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h over a period of time. The exact authorship of each passage or section is not always clear, and the book is considered a collective work of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and his followers.",
