  "prompt": "What is the religion of Abraham Lincoln?",
  "text": "Abraham Lincoln's religion is a matter of some debate and interpretation. He was born to a family of Baptists, but he never officially joined a church. Throughout his life, he expressed beliefs that were influenced by various Christian denominations, including Baptist, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian. However, he also expressed some unorthodox views, such as questioning the divinity of Jesus and the authority of the Bible.\n\nSome scholars have described Lincoln's religious views as a form of \"liberal Christianity\" or \"civil religion,\" which emphasized the importance of personal morality, individual liberty, and the principles of democracy. Others have described him as a \"deist,\" meaning that he believed in a God who created the universe but did not intervene in its affairs.\n\nOverall, while Lincoln's religious views were complex and evolving, he was generally influenced by Christianity and saw religion as an important force for promoting morality and ethical behavior in society.",
