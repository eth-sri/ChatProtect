  "text": "The Aleph is a short story written by Jorge Luis Borges, and it belongs to the genre of magical realism. Magical realism is a literary genre that combines elements of realism with magical or fantastical elements. The story blends philosophical and metaphysical ideas with a narrative that explores the nature of time, space, and reality, which are common themes in magical realism. The story's use of a fantastical device, such as the Aleph, which allows the protagonist to see all points in space and time simultaneously, is also characteristic of the genre.",
