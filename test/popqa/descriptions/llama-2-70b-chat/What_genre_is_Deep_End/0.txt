  "prompt": "What genre is Deep End?",
  "text": "Deep End is a 1970 British psychological drama film directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. It is not a genre film in the classical sense, but it has elements of surrealism, drama, and psychological horror.\n\nThe film follows a Polish immigrant, Mike, who takes a job as a night porter at a London hotel. He becomes increasingly unhinged and paranoid, experiencing strange and surreal visions and hallucinations. The film's narrative is fragmented, and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that adds to the sense of unease and tension.\n\nDeep End has been described as a surrealist nightmare, a psychological horror film, and a critique of the British class system. It features elements of drama, thriller, and horror, making it a unique and unsettling viewing experience that defies easy categorization.\n\nOverall, while Deep End can be classified as a psychological horror film, it also contains elements of other genres, making it a blend of different styles and themes that contribute to its unsettling and thought-provoking nature.",
