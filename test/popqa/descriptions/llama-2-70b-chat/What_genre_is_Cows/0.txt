  "prompt": "What genre is Cows?",
  "text": "Cows is a 1992 short film written and directed by Chris Cunningham. The film is often classified as a science fiction or experimental film, as it features surreal and abstract elements. It does not fit neatly into a specific genre, but it has been described as a work of \"sci-fi absurdism\" and has elements of animation, comedy, and horror. The film's unique blend of styles and themes makes it difficult to categorize, and it is often referred to as a \"mind-bending\" or \"thought-provoking\" work.",
