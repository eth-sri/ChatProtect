  "prompt": "What genre is Talk?",
  "text": "Talk is a genre of music that is often classified as a subgenre of rock music. It is characterized by its use of spoken word vocals, often delivered in a rhythmic or rhyming style, over a musical background that can range from simple to complex. Talk music can incorporate elements of various other genres, such as punk, new wave, and electronic music.\n\nSome notable examples of talk music include:\n\n* The Talking Heads, a new wave band known for their quirky, rhythmic talk-singing style.\n* Lou Reed, a pioneer of talk music, known for his deadpan, spoken-word delivery in songs like \"Walk on the Wild Side.\"\n* Laurie Anderson, a performance artist and musician known for her distinctive spoken-word style and use of electronic music elements.\n* William S. Burroughs, a writer and musician who experimented with spoken-word music in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nTalk music has also been associated with the poetry and spoken word scenes, as well as with avant-garde and experimental music. It continues to influence a wide range of contemporary music genres, from indie rock to electronic and hip-hop.",
