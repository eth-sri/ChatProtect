  "prompt": "What genre is Thin Ice?",
  "text": "Thin Ice is a 2011 crime comedy-drama film directed by Jill Sprecher. The movie follows the story of a struggling insurance agent who decides to participate in a scam by pretending to be a mentally challenged person in order to collect a large insurance settlement. However, things get complicated when he falls in love with his new \"family's\" rebellious daughter.\n\nI would classify Thin Ice as a dark comedy or a crime comedy-drama film. It has elements of both comedy and drama, but the overall tone is generally darker and more satirical, with a focus on the absurdity and greed of the characters' actions.",
