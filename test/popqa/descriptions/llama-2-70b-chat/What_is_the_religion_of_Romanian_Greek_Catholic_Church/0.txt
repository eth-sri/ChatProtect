  "prompt": "What is the religion of Romanian Greek Catholic Church?",
  "text": "The Romanian Greek Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Pope and the worldwide Catholic Church. It is one of the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with Rome. The Romanian Greek Catholic Church is part of the Byzantine tradition and its liturgy is based on the Byzantine Rite.\n\nThe Romanian Greek Catholic Church traces its roots back to the apostolic days, when Christianity was first preached in the region by St. Andrew and St. Paul. The Church developed and grew over the centuries, and in the 16th century, it came under the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the 17th century, a group of Romanian Orthodox Christians in Transylvania (now part of Romania) entered into communion with the Catholic Church, and the Romanian Greek Catholic Church was established.\n\nToday, the Romanian Greek Catholic Church has a relatively small number of followers, with an estimated 500,000 members worldwide, mostly in Romania, but also in other parts of Europe, the Americas, and Australia. Despite its relatively small size, the Church has played an important role in the history and culture of Romania, and it continues to be an important part of the spiritual lives of its members.",
