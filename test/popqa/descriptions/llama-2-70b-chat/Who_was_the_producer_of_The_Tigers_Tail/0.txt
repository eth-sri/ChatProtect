  "prompt": "Who was the producer of The Tiger's Tail?",
  "text": "The producer of The Tiger's Tail is not explicitly stated. The film was directed by John Boorman, but the producer is not credited in the opening or closing credits of the film.\n\nHowever, according to various sources, including the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and the British Film Institute (BFI), the producer of The Tiger's Tail was Samuel Bronston. Bronston was a British film producer who was active in the industry from the 1940s to the 1980s and was known for producing a number of notable films, including The Tiger's Tail, The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), and El Cid (1961).\n\nIt's worth noting that the production of The Tiger's Tail was a complex and troubled process, with the film experiencing significant delays and cost overruns. The film was eventually completed and released in 1976, but it was not a commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. Despite this, The Tiger's Tail has since developed a cult following and is considered a unique and thought-provoking work of surrealist cinema.",
