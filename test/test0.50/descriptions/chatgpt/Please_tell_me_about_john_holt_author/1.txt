  "text": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is widely credited with being the founder of the modern homeschooling movement. He was born in New York City and attended Yale University, where he studied physics and engineering. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Holt worked as a freelance writer and editor in New York City.\n\nHolt became interested in education in the 1950s and began to question the traditional methods of schooling. He believed that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and discover on their own, rather than being forced to memorize information and follow strict rules. Holt's ideas about education were influenced by the work of psychologists like Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson, as well as by his own experiences as a teacher.\n\nIn 1964, Holt published his first book, \"How Children Fail,\" which became a bestseller and established him as a leading voice in the education reform movement. He went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Teach Your Own.\"\n\nHolt's ideas about education and homeschooling have had a lasting impact on American education. He believed that children should be allowed to learn at their own pace, in their own way, and that parents should be free to choose the best educational path for their children. Today, there are millions of homeschoolers in the United States, and Holt's legacy continues to inspire parents and educators around the world.",
