  "text": "John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was born in New York City and studied at Yale University before serving in World War II. After the war, he became a teacher in the public school system, but soon became disillusioned with the traditional approach to education.\n\nHolt began writing and speaking about his ideas for education reform in the 1960s, and his first book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964. In it, he argued that the traditional model of education was failing children by focusing too much on rote memorization and not enough on critical thinking and creativity.\n\nHolt went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Instead of Education.\" He also founded the magazine \"Growing Without Schooling,\" which advocated for homeschooling and unschooling.\n\nHolt's ideas have had a significant impact on the homeschooling and unschooling movements, and his books are still widely read and influential today. He believed that children are natural learners and that education should be based on their interests and abilities, rather than on a predetermined curriculum. He also believed that children learn best through play, exploration, and discovery, rather than through formal instruction.",
