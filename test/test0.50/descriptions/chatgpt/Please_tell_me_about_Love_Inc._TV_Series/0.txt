The show follows the employees of a dating agency called \"Love, Inc.\" as they help their clients find love and navigate the ups and downs of their own relationships.\n\nThe main character is Denise Johnson, played by Busy Philipps, who is the newest employee at Love, Inc. She is joined by her coworkers, including the charismatic and smooth-talking Clea (Holly Robinson Peete), the nerdy and lovable Barry (Ion Overman), and the suave and confident Francisco (Vince Vieluf).\n\nThroughout the series, the team takes on various clients with unique dating challenges, such as a man who is too picky, a woman who is too desperate, and a couple who keeps breaking up and getting back together. Along the way, they also deal with their own romantic entanglements and personal struggles.\n\nDespite receiving positive reviews from critics, Love, Inc. struggled to find an audience and was cancelled after one season. However, it has since gained a cult following and is remembered for its witty writing, diverse cast, and heartwarming moments.",
