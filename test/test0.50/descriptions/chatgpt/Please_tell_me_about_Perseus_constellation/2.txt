  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.\n\nPerseus is most notable for the bright star Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which appears to change in brightness over a period of 2.87 days. The constellation also contains several other notable stars, including Mirfak, Atik, and Gorgonea Tertia.\n\nPerseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, the Double Cluster, and the California Nebula. The Perseid meteor shower, which occurs every August, is also named after the constellation as the meteors appear to radiate from the area of the sky where Perseus is located.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danae, and is most famous for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing Andromeda from a sea monster.",
