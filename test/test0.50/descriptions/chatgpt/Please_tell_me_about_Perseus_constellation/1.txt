  "prompt": "Please tell me about Perseus (constellation)",
  "text": "Perseus is a northern constellation named after the Greek hero Perseus. It is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus. \n\nPerseus is best known for containing the famous variable star Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star.\" Algol is a binary star system that appears to \"blink\" due to one star eclipsing the other, causing a temporary decrease in brightness. \n\nOther notable stars in Perseus include Mirfak, which is the brightest star in the constellation, and Atik, which is a triple star system. \n\nPerseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Double Cluster, which is a pair of open star clusters visible to the naked eye, and the California Nebula, a large emission nebula that glows red due to ionized hydrogen gas. \n\nIn Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Zeus and Dana\u00eb. He is best known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa and rescuing the princess Andromeda from a sea monster.",
