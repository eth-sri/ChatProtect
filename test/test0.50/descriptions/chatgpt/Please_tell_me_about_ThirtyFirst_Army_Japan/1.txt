  "text": "The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was established on February 5, 1944, and was initially assigned to defend the southern coast of China against a possible Allied invasion. The army was composed of two divisions, the 41st and the 64th, and was headquartered in Canton, China.\n\nIn August 1945, the Thirty-First Army was ordered to move to the Philippines to reinforce Japanese forces there. However, before the army could arrive, the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945. The Thirty-First Army was disbanded soon after.\n\nDuring its existence, the Thirty-First Army was involved in several battles and skirmishes, including the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou, the Battle of West Hunan, and the Battle of Changde. The army suffered heavy casualties, and its soldiers were often poorly equipped and lacked adequate supplies.\n\nOverall, the Thirty-First Army was not a particularly successful or significant force in the war. Its main role was defensive, and it was unable to prevent the Allied advance in China and Southeast Asia.",
