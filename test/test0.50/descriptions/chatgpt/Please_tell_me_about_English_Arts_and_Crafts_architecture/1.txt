  "text": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials.\n\nThe style is known for its use of local materials such as stone, brick, and timber, and its emphasis on the use of hand-crafted details such as decorative tiles, stained glass, and carved woodwork. The architecture is often asymmetrical, with irregular roof lines and a mix of different materials and textures.\n\nThe movement was led by architects such as William Morris, who founded the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. company, which produced furniture, textiles, and other decorative items. Other notable architects associated with the Arts and Crafts movement include C.F.A. Voysey, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and Edwin Lutyens.\n\nEnglish Arts and Crafts architecture had a significant influence on the development of modern architecture, particularly in the United States. The movement's emphasis on craftsmanship and the use of natural materials can be seen in the work of architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Greene and Greene.",
