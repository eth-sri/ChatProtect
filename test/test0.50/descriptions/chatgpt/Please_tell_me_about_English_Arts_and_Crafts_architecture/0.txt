  "text": "English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made goods of the Industrial Revolution, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and a focus on the beauty of natural materials.\n\nThe style is characterized by its use of traditional materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and its emphasis on handcrafted details such as intricate carvings, decorative tiles, and stained glass. It also often features asymmetrical designs, steeply pitched roofs, and large chimneys.\n\nOne of the key figures in the Arts and Crafts movement was William Morris, who believed that the beauty of an object lay in the way it was made, and that mass-produced goods lacked the soul and character of handcrafted items. Morris founded the firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. (later known as Morris & Co.) which produced a wide range of decorative arts, including furniture, textiles, and wallpaper.\n\nOther notable architects associated with the Arts and Crafts movement include C.F.A. Voysey, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and Edwin Lutyens. The movement had a significant influence on the development of modern architecture, particularly in the use of natural materials and the integration of design with the surrounding landscape.",
