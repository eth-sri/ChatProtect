  "text": "Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian scientist and broadcaster who made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear medicine and environmental science. He was born in Montreal and received his education at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry.\n\nSeguin's early research focused on the use of radioactive isotopes in medicine, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. He was a pioneer in the development of radiopharmaceuticals, which are drugs that contain radioactive isotopes and are used in medical imaging and therapy.\n\nLater in his career, Seguin turned his attention to environmental science and became an advocate for sustainable development. He was a strong proponent of the precautionary principle, which holds that in the face of uncertainty about the potential harm of a particular activity or substance, it is better to err on the side of caution.\n\nSeguin was also a popular broadcaster, hosting a number of television and radio programs on science and the environment. He was known for his ability to communicate complex scientific concepts in an accessible and engaging way.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to science and broadcasting, Seguin was awarded numerous honors and accolades, including the Order of Canada and the Prix du Qu\u00e9bec. He died in 1988 at the age of 66.",
