  "text": "The Bailey\u2013Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. Built in 1905, it was originally the home of William Henry Bailey, who was a prominent businessman and politician in the area. Bailey served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1906 to 1908 and was also a member of the Florida House of Representatives.\n\nIn 1929, the house was sold to the Thompson family, who owned it for several decades. During this time, the house was used as a boarding house and also served as a home for the elderly.\n\nIn the 1980s, the house was purchased by the Tallahassee Garden Club, who restored it to its original condition. The Bailey\u2013Thompson House is now used as a venue for weddings, receptions, and other events.\n\nThe house is a fine example of the Colonial Revival architectural style, featuring a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a central entrance with a pedimented portico, and a hipped roof with dormer windows. The interior of the house is decorated with period furnishings and features original woodwork, stained glass windows, and a grand staircase.\n\nThe Bailey\u2013Thompson House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a popular destination for visitors to Tallahassee who are interested in the city's history and architecture.",
