  "text": "The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by George W. Saxon, a prominent businessman and civic leader in the city. The home was later purchased by William Bailey, a local attorney and politician, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Thompson Bailey.\n\nThe Bailey-Thompson House is an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, featuring a steeply-pitched roof, asymmetrical fa\u00e7ade, and ornate detailing. The home has a wrap-around porch, a turret, and a large bay window, all of which add to its distinctive appearance.\n\nOver the years, the Bailey-Thompson House has been used for a variety of purposes, including as a private residence, a boarding house, and a law office. In 1973, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places, recognizing its significance as an important example of late 19th-century architecture in Florida.\n\nToday, the Bailey-Thompson House is owned by the Tallahassee Historical Society and is open to the public for tours and events. It is also available for private events, such as weddings and receptions.",
