The Thompson family lived in the home for over 100 years, and it remained in their possession until the 1970s.\n\nToday, the Bailey-Thompson House is a popular event venue and is often used for weddings, receptions, and other special occasions. The home has been restored to its original grandeur and features many of its original furnishings and decorations.\n\nThe Bailey-Thompson House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a must-see for anyone interested in the history and architecture of Tallahassee.",
