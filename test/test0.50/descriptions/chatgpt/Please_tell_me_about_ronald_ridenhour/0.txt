  "text": "Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier and Vietnam War veteran who is best known for exposing the My Lai massacre. The My Lai massacre was a mass killing of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by U.S. Army soldiers in 1968. Ridenhour heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers who had been there and was shocked by what he learned. He spent several years investigating and collecting evidence before finally going public with the story in 1969. His efforts led to a military investigation and the eventual prosecution of several soldiers involved in the massacre. Ridenhour later became an activist and writer, speaking out against war and advocating for peace. He died in 1998 at the age of 52.",
