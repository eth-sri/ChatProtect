  "text": " Fernand Seguin (1922-2018) was a French-Canadian biochemist and science communicator. He is best known for his work on the structure and function of enzymes, particularly the enzyme amylase, and for his efforts in promoting science education and literacy.\n\nSeguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied at the University of Montreal, where he earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in biochemistry. He went on to complete his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and then returned to Canada to work at the National Research Council in Ottawa.\n\nSeguin's research focused on the structure and function of enzymes, which are biological molecules that catalyze chemical reactions. He made significant contributions to our understanding of the enzyme amylase, which breaks down starches into simple sugars. His work helped to elucidate the mechanism by which amylase works and led to the development of new methods for analyzing enzyme structures and functions.\n\nIn addition to his research, Seguin was a passionate advocate for science education and literacy. He was a popular lecturer and author, and he wrote several books on science and science history. He also appeared on radio and television programs to discuss science and its importance in modern society.\n\nThroughout his career, Seguin was recognized with numerous honors and awards for his contributions to science and education. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1968 and was awarded the Order of Canada in 1979. He continued to work and teach until his death in 2018, leaving a legacy of scientific discovery and education.",
