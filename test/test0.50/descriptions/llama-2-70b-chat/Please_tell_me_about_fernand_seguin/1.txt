  "text": " Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a French-Canadian biochemist and science communicator. He is best known for his work on the metabolism of amino acids and his contributions to the field of biochemistry.\n\nSeguin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied at the University of Montreal, where he received his undergraduate degree in chemistry. He went on to pursue graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where he earned his PhD in biochemistry in 1948.\n\nAfter completing his PhD, Seguin held various research positions at several institutions, including the University of Chicago, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Montreal. He also worked as a researcher for the Canadian government's National Research Council.\n\nSeguin's research focused on the metabolism of amino acids, and he made significant contributions to the field of biochemistry. He discovered the role of the enzyme \"transaminase\" in the transfer of amino groups between amino acids, and he identified the mechanisms by which the body metabolizes certain amino acids.\n\nIn addition to his research, Seguin was also a dedicated science communicator. He wrote several books and articles on biochemistry and related topics, and he was a frequent guest on Canadian television and radio programs, where he discussed science and its applications.\n\nSeguin received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the Royal Society of Canada's McNeil Medal for his contributions to biochemistry. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nOverall, Fernand Seguin was a respected biochemist and science communicator who made significant contributions to the field of biochemistry and helped to promote scientific literacy among the general public.",
