  "text": " Brazil and Angola have had diplomatic relations since 1975, soon after Angola gained independence from Portugal. The two countries have a strong historical connection, as Brazil was a major destination for Angolan slaves during the Atlantic slave trade. In recent years, Brazil has become one of Angola's main economic partners, with significant trade and investment ties between the two countries.\n\nIn 2010, Brazil's then-President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Angola, signing several agreements aimed at strengthening economic and political ties. Since then, Brazil has become one of Angola's largest investors, with interests in sectors such as oil, mining, and agriculture.\n\nIn 2018, Angola's President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o visited Brazil, where he met with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. During the visit, the two leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral relations and signed several agreements, including one aimed at increasing trade and investment between the two countries.\n\nBrazil has also played a key role in supporting Angola's economic development, particularly in the areas of infrastructure and energy. In 2017, Brazil's development bank, BNDES, signed a $1.2 billion loan agreement with Angola to finance the construction of a hydroelectric dam.\n\nIn addition to economic ties, Brazil and Angola have also cooperated in the fields of education, culture, and defense. In 2019, the two countries signed an agreement aimed at strengthening cooperation in the fields of education, science, and technology.\n\nOverall, Brazil-Angola relations have been strong and continue to grow, with a focus on economic cooperation, cultural exchange, and regional stability.",
