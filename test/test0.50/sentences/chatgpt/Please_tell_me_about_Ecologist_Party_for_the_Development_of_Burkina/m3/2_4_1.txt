  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the party's involvement in promoting environmental sustainability and social justice in Burkina Faso. The party's focus on environmental issues and sustainable development is closely linked to its advocacy for the rights of marginalized communities and indigenous people, as these groups are often disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and lack of access to basic resources such as clean water and sanitation. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the PED-BF's goals and activities."
