Both statements highlight the challenges that the party has faced in gaining support and achieving success in national elections. Statement 1 focuses on internal conflicts and resource limitations, while Statement 2 highlights the dominance of larger political parties in Burkina Faso. These challenges are not mutually exclusive and can both contribute to the party's struggles."
