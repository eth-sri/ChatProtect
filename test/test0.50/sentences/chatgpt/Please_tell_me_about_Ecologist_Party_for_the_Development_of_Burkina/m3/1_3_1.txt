Statement 1 claims that the party is led by its founder and president, Ram Ouedraogo, while statement 2 claims that the party is led by its founder, Arouna Ou\u00e9draogo. As the names are different, it is not clear whether they are referring to the same person or two different individuals. Therefore, the statements cannot be reconciled and are contradictory."
