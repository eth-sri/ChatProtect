  "explanation": "The statements about the Ecologist Party for the Development of Burkina are not contradictory. Both statements mention the party's primary focus on environmental issues and sustainable development. The only difference is that the first statement also includes social justice as a focus area, while the second statement does not. However, this does not contradict the second statement's mention of promoting sustainable development, which can also encompass social justice issues."
