Both statements highlight the party's focus on environmental issues and sustainable development, and how this has helped to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the environment in Burkina Faso. The first statement emphasizes the party's role in promoting sustainable development, while the second statement highlights how the party's focus on environmental concerns has influenced other political parties to prioritize environmental policies. Both statements are complementary and support the idea that the PED-BF has had a positive impact on environmental awareness and policy in Burkina Faso."
