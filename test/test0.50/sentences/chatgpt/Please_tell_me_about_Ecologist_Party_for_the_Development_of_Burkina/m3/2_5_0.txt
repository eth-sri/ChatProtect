Statement 1 acknowledges that the party is relatively small, but has gained significant support from voters who prioritize environmental issues and sustainable development. Statement 2 highlights the fact that the party is one of the few in Burkina Faso with a strong focus on these issues. Both statements are consistent with the idea that the PED-BF is a political party that prioritizes environmental concerns and sustainable development."
