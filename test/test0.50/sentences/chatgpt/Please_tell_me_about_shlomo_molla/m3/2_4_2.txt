  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Molla joined the Yesh Atid party and was successful in the 2013 elections, while Statement 2 suggests that he was not re-elected to the Knesset in the same year. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
