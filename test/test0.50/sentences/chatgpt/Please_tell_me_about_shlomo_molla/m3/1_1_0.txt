  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory. Statement 1 specifies that he was born on January 10, 1968, while Statement 2 does not provide his exact birthdate. Additionally, Statement 1 mentions that he immigrated to Israel as part of Operation Moses, while Statement 2 does not specify the reason for his immigration. Therefore, the two statements provide different information about Shlomo Molla's birthdate and immigration history, making them contradictory."
