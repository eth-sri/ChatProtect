During his time in the Knesset, Molla was known for his advocacy for the rights of Ethiopian Israelis and for promoting interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims. In 2013, Molla left Meretz and joined the newly-formed Yesh Atid party, which went on to win 19 seats in the Knesset in that year's elections.",
