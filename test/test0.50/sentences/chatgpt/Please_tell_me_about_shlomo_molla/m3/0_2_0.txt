  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory as they provide conflicting information about his educational background. Statement 1 states that he earned a degree in political science from Tel Aviv University, while Statement 2 states that he earned a degree in political science and international relations from Bar-Ilan University. It is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
