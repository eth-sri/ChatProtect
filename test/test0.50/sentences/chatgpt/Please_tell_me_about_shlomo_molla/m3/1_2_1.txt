  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are contradictory as they provide different information about where he studied political science. Statement 1 states that he earned a degree in political science from Tel Aviv University, while statement 2 states that he studied political science and international relations at Bar-Ilan University. It is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
