  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements highlight Molla's involvement in social and community organizations, particularly his role as chairman of the Ethiopian National Project, and his focus on promoting the integration of Ethiopian-Israelis into Israeli society. Statement 2 provides more detail about Molla's work with the Ethiopian National Project, while Statement 1 simply mentions his involvement in various organizations. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Molla as a politician and activist dedicated to improving the lives of Ethiopian-Israelis."
