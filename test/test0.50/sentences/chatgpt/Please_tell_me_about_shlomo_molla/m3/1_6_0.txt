  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Molla joined a new political party in 2013, while the second statement states that he left the Knesset in the same year. These statements do not contradict each other as leaving a political party and leaving the Knesset are two separate actions."
