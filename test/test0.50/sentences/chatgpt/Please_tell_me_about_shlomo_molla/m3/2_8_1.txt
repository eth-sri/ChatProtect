  "prefix": " Shlomo Molla is an Israeli politician and activist. He was born in Ethiopia in 1964 and immigrated to Israel in 1984. Molla began his political career in 2003 when he was elected to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, as a member of the left-wing Meretz party. During his time in the Knesset, Molla was known for his advocacy for the rights of Ethiopian Israelis and for promoting interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims. In 2013, Molla left Meretz and joined the newly-formed Yesh Atid party, which went on to win 19 seats in the Knesset in that year's elections. Molla was re-elected to the Knesset as a member of Yesh Atid, but he resigned from the party in 2014 due to disagreements with party leader Yair Lapid. Outside of politics, Molla has been involved in various social and cultural initiatives. He has worked to promote Ethiopian-Israeli culture and heritage, and has been involved in efforts to improve education and employment opportunities for Ethiopian Israelis.",
