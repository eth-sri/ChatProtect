Molla began his political career in 2003 when he was elected to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, as a member of the left-wing Meretz party. During his time in the Knesset, Molla was known for his advocacy for the rights of Ethiopian Israelis and for promoting interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims. In 2013, Molla left Meretz and joined the newly-formed Yesh Atid party, which went on to win 19 seats in the Knesset in that year's elections.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about his political career. The first statement explains that Molla joined the Yesh Atid party after leaving Meretz, but later resigned due to disagreements with the party leader. The second statement adds that Molla resigned from the Knesset in 2015, which may or may not be related to his departure from Yesh Atid. Overall, the statements provide a more complete picture of Molla's political trajectory."
