  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. Both statements highlight Shlomo Molla's work in promoting the rights and integration of Ethiopian Israelis, as well as his involvement in social and political initiatives. The first statement specifically mentions his work with refugees and asylum seekers, while the second statement focuses on his time in the Knesset. However, both statements are consistent in portraying Molla as an advocate for the Ethiopian Jewish community and a champion of their rights."
