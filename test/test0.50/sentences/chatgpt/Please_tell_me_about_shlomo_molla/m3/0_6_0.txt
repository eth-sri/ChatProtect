  "explanation": "The statements about Shlomo Molla are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his efforts to promote the integration of Ethiopian Israelis into Israeli society and combat discrimination against the community. The only difference is that statement 1 includes the additional detail that Molla worked to promote the rights of Ethiopian Israelis, while statement 2 does not mention this specifically. However, both statements convey the same overall message about Molla's advocacy for the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel."
