  "explanation": "The two statements about Mike Rawlings are not contradictory. They both state that he was succeeded by Eric Johnson as the mayor of Dallas in 2019, but the first statement adds that Rawlings was re-elected in 2015 and served until 2019. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about Rawlings' tenure as mayor."
