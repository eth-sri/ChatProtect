Both statements mention his advocacy for gun control and his speaking out against hate crimes and extremism in the United States. The only difference is that statement 1 is more general, while statement 2 specifically mentions Rawlings' stance on gun control laws. However, both statements are consistent with Rawlings' public positions on these issues."
