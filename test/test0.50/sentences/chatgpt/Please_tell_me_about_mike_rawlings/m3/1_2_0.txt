  "explanation": "The statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Rawlings worked in the advertising industry before entering politics, while statement 2 states that he worked as the CEO of Pizza Hut. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they describe different career paths for Rawlings. Therefore, they are contradictory."
