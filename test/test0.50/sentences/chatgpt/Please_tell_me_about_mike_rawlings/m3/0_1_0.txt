  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mike Rawlings are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was born in Borger, Texas and grew up in Hockley, Texas, while statement 2 only mentions that he was born in Borger, Texas. The two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as one provides additional information about Rawlings' upbringing that the other does not."
