  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about other notable stars in the constellation, including Algol and Delta Persei. Statement 2 specifically mentions Algol as a binary star system, which is consistent with the periodic changes in brightness mentioned in Statement 1. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the constellation and its stars."
