  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky. It is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa. The constellation is located near the constellations of Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Auriga. Perseus is one of the 48 constellations listed by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his Almagest. It is visible from the months of August to March in the northern hemisphere. The brightest star in the constellation is Mirfak, which is also known as Alpha Persei. It is a yellow-white supergiant star that is approximately 600 light-years away from Earth. Other notable stars in Perseus include Algol, which is a binary star system that exhibits periodic changes in brightness, and Delta Persei, which is a blue-white giant star. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster, which is a massive cluster of galaxies located approximately 250 million light-years away. The constellation also contains the Double Cluster, which is a pair of open star clusters that are located approximately 7,500 light-years away from Earth. In mythology, Perseus is known for his bravery and heroism. He is often depicted holding the head of Medusa, which he used to turn his enemies to stone.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the hero Perseus holding the head of Medusa in his hand, which is a common depiction of the constellation in mythology. The only difference between the two statements is the mention of a sword in one of them, which does not contradict the other statement. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
