  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Perseus is most notable for the bright star Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which appears to change in brightness over a period of 2.87 days. The constellation also contains several other notable stars, including Mirfak, Atik, and Gorgonea Tertia. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, the Double Cluster, and the California Nebula.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. They both provide information about the Perseid meteor shower and its association with the constellation Perseus. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that the meteor shower is named after the constellation, while statement 2 simply states that it occurs annually in August and appears to radiate from Perseus. However, both statements convey the same idea that the Perseid meteor shower is linked to the Perseus constellation."
