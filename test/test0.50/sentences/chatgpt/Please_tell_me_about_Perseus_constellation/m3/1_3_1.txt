  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides additional information about the famous variable star Algol, which is located in the Perseus constellation. It explains that Algol is a binary star system that appears to \"blink\" due to one star eclipsing the other, causing a temporary decrease in brightness. Statement 2 also provides information about a binary star system in the Perseus constellation, which is visible to the naked eye. Both statements are true and complement each other, providing different details about the same constellation."
