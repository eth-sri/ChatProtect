  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the constellation is named after the Greek hero Perseus, who is known for slaying the Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Perseus is a mythological hero, which is already implied in statement 1. Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other."
