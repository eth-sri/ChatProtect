  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory, but rather similar. Both statements mention that the constellation is located near Cassiopeia and Andromeda, and the only difference is that statement 1 includes Auriga while statement 2 includes Pegasus. However, this does not create a contradiction as both statements are true and provide additional information about the neighboring constellations."
