  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory, but they differ in the wording used to describe the star Algol. Statement 1 describes Algol as a bright star that appears to change in brightness, while Statement 2 describes it as a variable star. However, both statements refer to the same star and convey the same idea that Algol is a notable feature of the Perseus constellation."
