  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. They both state that Perseus is one of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy, with the only difference being the specific reference to Ptolemy's Almagest in statement 1. Therefore, both statements provide consistent information about the constellation's inclusion in Ptolemy's list of constellations."
