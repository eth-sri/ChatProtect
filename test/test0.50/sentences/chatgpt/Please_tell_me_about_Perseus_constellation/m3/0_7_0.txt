  "explanation": "The statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about other notable stars in the constellation, with Statement 1 mentioning Delta Persei and Statement 2 mentioning Atik. The only difference is that Statement 2 also includes a nickname for Algol, which is not mentioned in Statement 1. However, this does not contradict the information provided in Statement 1."
