  "alt": "The meteors known as the Perseids appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus.",
  "prefix": " Perseus is a constellation located in the northern sky, named after the Greek hero Perseus. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Perseus is most notable for the bright star Algol, also known as the \"Demon Star,\" which appears to change in brightness over a period of 2.87 days. The constellation also contains several other notable stars, including Mirfak, Atik, and Gorgonea Tertia. Perseus is also home to several deep-sky objects, including the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, the Double Cluster, and the California Nebula.",

  "explanation": "The two statements about Perseus (constellation) are not contradictory. They both refer to the Perseid meteor shower and its association with the constellation Perseus. Statement 1 provides additional information about the timing of the meteor shower, while Statement 2 simply reiterates that the meteors appear to originate from the constellation. Together, the statements provide a more complete picture of the connection between Perseus and the Perseid meteor shower."
