  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Peter Raffl of EC KAC Klagenfurt had 76 points (31 goals, 45 assists) in 36 games, while Statement 2 states that he scored 51 points in 36 games. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the same player's performance in the same season."
