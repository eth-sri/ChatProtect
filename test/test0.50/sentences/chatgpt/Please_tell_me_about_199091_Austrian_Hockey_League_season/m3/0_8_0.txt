  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about the number of championships won by EC KAC Klagenfurt in their team history, while Statement 2 highlights that they won the championship for the second consecutive year. Both statements can be true at the same time, as winning the championship in a particular season does not necessarily mean it is their first or only championship."
