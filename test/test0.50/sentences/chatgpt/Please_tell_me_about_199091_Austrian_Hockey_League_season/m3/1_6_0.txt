  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that VEU Feldkirch defeated Innsbrucker EV, EC VSV, and EC KAC to win the championship, while Statement 2 mentions that VEU Feldkirch defeated EC VSV in the finals to win the championship. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about which teams VEU Feldkirch defeated to win the championship."
