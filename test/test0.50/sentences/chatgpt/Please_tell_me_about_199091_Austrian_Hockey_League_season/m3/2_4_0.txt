  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 describes the semifinals, where the Vienna Capitals defeated the Graz 99ers and VEU Feldkirch swept EC KAC. However, Statement 2 describes the semifinals differently, stating that the Vienna Capitals defeated both the Graz 99ers and VEU Feldkirch to advance to the championship series. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they describe different outcomes for the semifinals."
