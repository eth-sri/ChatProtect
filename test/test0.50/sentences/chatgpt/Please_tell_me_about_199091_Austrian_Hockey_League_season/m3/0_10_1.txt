  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Reinhard Divis of VEU Feldkirch had a goals against average of 2.68 and a save percentage of .917 in 35 games, while Statement 2 states that he had a 2.98 goals against average in 36 games. The two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the same player's performance in the same season."
