  "explanation": "The two statements are not contradictory, but rather convey the same information in slightly different ways. Both statements highlight the fact that VEU Feldkirch won their sixth championship in the Austrian Hockey League during the 1990-91 season. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that this was their sixth championship win in eight years, while statement 2 simply states that it was their sixth championship win overall."
