  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the championship was won by VEU Feldkirch, which is consistent. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about the number of teams in the league and the fact that it was VEU Feldkirch's sixth championship. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
