  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the playoffs were played in a best-of-five format, but the second statement adds that the top eight teams from the regular season qualified for the playoffs. This additional information does not contradict the first statement, but rather provides more detail about how the teams qualified for the playoffs."
