  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 states that EC KAC Klagenfurt finished the regular season in first place with 74 points, while Statement 2 states that they finished in first place with only 56 points. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, so they are contradictory."
