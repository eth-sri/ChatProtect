  "explanation": "The statements about the 1990-91 Austrian Hockey League season are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Peter Raffl of EC KAC Klagenfurt was the league's leading scorer with 76 points, while Statement 2 says that he had the most points in the regular season with 51. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. It is possible that Statement 1 refers to Raffl's total points for the entire season, including playoffs, while Statement 2 refers only to his regular season points. However, without further clarification, the statements remain contradictory."
