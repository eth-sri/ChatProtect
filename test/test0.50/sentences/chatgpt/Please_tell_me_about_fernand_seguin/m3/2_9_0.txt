Statement 1 mentions his involvement in the establishment of the Biosphere, a museum and research center dedicated to the study of the environment, while statement 2 mentions his involvement in the establishment of the Biosphere Reserve Program in Canada. These are two separate initiatives related to environmental conservation and research, and both statements highlight Seguin's contributions in this field."
