  "prefix": " Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian scientist and broadcaster who made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear medicine and environmental science. He was born in Montreal and received his education at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry. Seguin's early research focused on the use of radioactive isotopes in medicine, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. He was a pioneer in the development of radiopharmaceuticals, which are drugs that contain radioactive isotopes and are used in medical imaging and therapy. Later in his career, Seguin turned his attention to environmental science and became an advocate for sustainable development. He was a strong proponent of the precautionary principle, which holds that in the face of uncertainty about the potential harm of a particular activity or substance, it is better to err on the side of caution. Seguin was also a popular broadcaster, hosting a number of television and radio programs on science and the environment. He was known for his ability to communicate complex scientific concepts in an accessible and engaging way.",

Statement 1 provides a general overview of the honors and accolades he received, while Statement 2 specifically mentions the Order of Canada and the year he received it. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Seguin was recognized for his contributions to science and broadcasting."
