  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight different aspects of his career and expertise, with the first statement emphasizing his roles as a scientist and educator, while the second statement focuses on his specific field of biochemistry and his work as a radio and television host. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of Fernand Seguin's contributions to Canadian science and media."
