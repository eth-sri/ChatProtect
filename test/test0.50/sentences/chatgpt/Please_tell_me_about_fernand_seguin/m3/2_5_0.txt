They both provide additional information about his career after he received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Montreal. The first statement mentions his work as a research scientist at the National Research Council of Canada and later at McGill University, while the second statement highlights his career as a professor of biochemistry at the University of Montreal and his role as the director of the Institute of Environmental Sciences at the same university. Both statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Seguin's professional achievements."
