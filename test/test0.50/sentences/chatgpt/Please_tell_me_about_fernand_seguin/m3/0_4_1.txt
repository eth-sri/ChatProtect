  "prefix": " Fernand Seguin (1922-1988) was a Canadian scientist and broadcaster who made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear medicine and environmental science. He was born in Montreal and received his education at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry. Seguin's early research focused on the use of radioactive isotopes in medicine, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. He was a pioneer in the development of radiopharmaceuticals, which are drugs that contain radioactive isotopes and are used in medical imaging and therapy.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. While he initially focused on nuclear medicine, he later shifted his focus to environmental science and became an advocate for sustainable development. However, his early work in nuclear medicine, particularly in the development of radiopharmaceuticals, laid the foundation for the field and had a significant impact on medical imaging and therapy. Therefore, both statements are true and complement each other."
