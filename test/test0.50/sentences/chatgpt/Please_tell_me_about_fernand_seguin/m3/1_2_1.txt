  "explanation": "The statements about Fernand Seguin are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his pioneering work in the field of environmental science and his contributions to radio and television broadcasting. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions his work in broadcasting, while statement 2 focuses solely on his contributions to environmental science. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Seguin as a pioneering figure in his field."
