Both statements mention that he represented the Welsh national team, earned 77 caps, and played a key role in their historic run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016. The only difference is that statement 2 is more concise and does not mention that he played in the UEFA Champions League or specify the number of titles and cups he won with Celtic."
