  "explanation": "The statements about Joe Ledley are not contradictory, but they present the same information in a slightly different way. Both statements mention that Ledley played 256 games for Cardiff City and scored 30 goals, but the second statement specifies that these appearances were made during his time at Cardiff City, which lasted for 228 games. Therefore, the second statement provides more context and clarifies that Ledley scored 30 goals in 228 appearances for Cardiff City."
