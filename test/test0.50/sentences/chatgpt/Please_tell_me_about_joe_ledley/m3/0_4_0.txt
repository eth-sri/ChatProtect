Statement 1 says that he joined Derby County in 2017 after playing for Crystal Palace for three seasons, while Statement 2 says that he played for Crystal Palace until 2018. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the duration of Ledley's time at Crystal Palace."
