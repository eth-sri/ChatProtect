The home was later purchased by William Bailey, a local attorney and politician, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Thompson Bailey. The Bailey-Thompson House is an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, featuring a steeply-pitched roof, asymmetrical fa\u00e7ade, and ornate detailing. The home has a wrap-around porch, a turret, and a large bay window, all of which add to its distinctive appearance. Over the years, the Bailey-Thompson House has been used for a variety of purposes, including as a private residence, a boarding house, and a law office.",
