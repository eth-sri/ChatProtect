  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the home was purchased by William Bailey, a local attorney and politician, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Thompson Bailey. The only difference is the year of the purchase mentioned in each statement. Statement 1 mentions that the home was later purchased by the Baileys, while Statement 2 specifies that the purchase happened in 1906. However, both statements agree that the Bailey family owned the home for several decades."
