Bailey served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1906 to 1908 and was also a member of the Florida House of Representatives. In 1929, the house was sold to the Thompson family, who owned it for several decades. During this time, the house was used as a boarding house and also served as a home for the elderly. In the 1980s, the house was purchased by the Tallahassee Garden Club, who restored it to its original condition. The Bailey\u2013Thompson House is now used as a venue for weddings, receptions, and other events.",
