The home was originally built for John Parkhill Bailey, a prominent lawyer and politician, and his family. In 1870, the home was sold to George Thompson, a wealthy businessman, who added several additions to the house. The Thompson family lived in the home for over 100 years, and it remained in their possession until the 1970s.",
