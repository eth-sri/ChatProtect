  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the house was built in 1905 for William Henry Bailey, while Statement 2 claims that it was originally built in 1840 for John Parkhill Bailey. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the origin and history of the house."
