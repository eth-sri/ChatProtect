The home was originally built for John Parkhill Bailey, a prominent lawyer and politician, and his family. In 1870, the home was sold to George Thompson, a wealthy businessman, who added several additions to the house. The Thompson family lived in the home for over 100 years, and it remained in their possession until the 1970s. Today, the Bailey-Thompson House is a popular event venue and is often used for weddings, receptions, and other special occasions.",
