  "prefix": " The Bailey-Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. It was built in 1895 by George W. Saxon, a prominent businessman and civic leader in the city. The home was later purchased by William Bailey, a local attorney and politician, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Thompson Bailey. The Bailey-Thompson House is an excellent example of Queen Anne-style architecture, featuring a steeply-pitched roof, asymmetrical fa\u00e7ade, and ornate detailing. The home has a wrap-around porch, a turret, and a large bay window, all of which add to its distinctive appearance. Over the years, the Bailey-Thompson House has been used for a variety of purposes, including as a private residence, a boarding house, and a law office. In 1973, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places, recognizing its significance as an important example of late 19th-century architecture in Florida.",

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 says that the house is owned by the Tallahassee Historical Society, while statement 2 says that it is owned by the State of Florida. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be accurate."
