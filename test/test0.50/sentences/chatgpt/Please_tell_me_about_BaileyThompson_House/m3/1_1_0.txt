  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory as they provide different years for when the house was built and by whom. Statement 1 claims that the house was built in 1895 by George W. Saxon, while statement 2 claims that it was built in 1885 for attorney Charles H. Bailey. These two statements cannot both be true, so they are contradictory."
