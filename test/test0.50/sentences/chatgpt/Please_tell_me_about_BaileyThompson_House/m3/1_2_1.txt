  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the home was purchased by William Bailey and his wife Mary Elizabeth Thompson Bailey, while Statement 2 mentions that the home was purchased by William N. Bailey. The use of different middle initials suggests that these are two different individuals, and therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
