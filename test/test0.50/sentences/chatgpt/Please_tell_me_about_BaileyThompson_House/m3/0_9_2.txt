  "prefix": " The Bailey\u2013Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. Built in 1905, it was originally the home of William Henry Bailey, who was a prominent businessman and politician in the area. Bailey served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1906 to 1908 and was also a member of the Florida House of Representatives. In 1929, the house was sold to the Thompson family, who owned it for several decades. During this time, the house was used as a boarding house and also served as a home for the elderly. In the 1980s, the house was purchased by the Tallahassee Garden Club, who restored it to its original condition. The Bailey\u2013Thompson House is now used as a venue for weddings, receptions, and other events. The house is a fine example of the Colonial Revival architectural style, featuring a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a central entrance with a pedimented portico, and a hipped roof with dormer windows. The interior of the house is decorated with period furnishings and features original woodwork, stained glass windows, and a grand staircase.",

Statement 2 adds to this by highlighting the beauty of the gardens surrounding the house, which is a separate but complementary aspect of the property. Both statements provide different but accurate information about the Bailey-Thompson House."
