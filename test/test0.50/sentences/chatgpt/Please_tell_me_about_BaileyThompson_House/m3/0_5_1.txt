In 1929, the house was sold to the Thompson family, who owned it for several decades. During this time, the house was used as a boarding house and also served as a home for the elderly.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that the house was restored by the Tallahassee Garden Club in the 1980s, while Statement 2 claims that it was restored by the same organization in the 1970s. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different timelines for the restoration of the house."
