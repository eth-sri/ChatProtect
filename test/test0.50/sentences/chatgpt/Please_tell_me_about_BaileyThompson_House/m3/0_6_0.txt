  "prefix": " The Bailey\u2013Thompson House is a historic home located in Tallahassee, Florida. Built in 1905, it was originally the home of William Henry Bailey, who was a prominent businessman and politician in the area. Bailey served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1906 to 1908 and was also a member of the Florida House of Representatives. In 1929, the house was sold to the Thompson family, who owned it for several decades. During this time, the house was used as a boarding house and also served as a home for the elderly. In the 1980s, the house was purchased by the Tallahassee Garden Club, who restored it to its original condition.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the house is used as a venue for weddings and other events. The only difference is that statement 1 includes receptions as a specific type of event, while statement 2 uses the more general term \"special events.\" However, both statements convey the same overall message about the current use of the house."
