  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are contradictory. The first statement describes it as an example of antebellum architecture, which refers to the period before the American Civil War. The second statement describes it as an example of the Queen Anne architectural style, which emerged in the late 19th century, after the Civil War. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
