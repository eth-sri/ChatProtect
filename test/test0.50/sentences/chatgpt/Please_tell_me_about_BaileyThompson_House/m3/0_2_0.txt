  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the term \"Please tell me about Bailey\u2013Thompson House\" are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Bailey served as the mayor of Tallahassee from 1906 to 1908, while Statement 2 says that he served as the mayor from 1905 to 1906. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time, as they provide different information about the same event. Therefore, they are contradictory."
