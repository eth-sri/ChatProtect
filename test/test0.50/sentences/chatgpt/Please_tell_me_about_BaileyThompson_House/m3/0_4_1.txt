  "explanation": "The statements about the Bailey-Thompson House are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about the different uses of the house over time. The first statement mentions that the house was used as a boarding house and home for the elderly during the Thompson family's ownership, while the second statement notes that the house was later used as a funeral home before being restored and converted into a law office. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide a more complete picture of the history of the Bailey-Thompson House."
