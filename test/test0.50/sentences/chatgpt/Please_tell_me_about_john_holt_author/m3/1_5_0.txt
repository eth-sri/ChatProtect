He was born in New York City and attended Yale University, where he studied physics and engineering. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Holt worked as a freelance writer and editor in New York City. Holt became interested in education in the 1950s and began to question the traditional methods of schooling. He believed that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and discover on their own, rather than being forced to memorize information and follow strict rules.",
