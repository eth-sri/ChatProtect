  "explanation": "The statements about John Holt are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his belief that traditional schooling can hinder a child's natural curiosity and love of learning. The first statement emphasizes that children learn best when they are free to pursue their own interests, while the second statement emphasizes that traditional schooling can stifle this natural curiosity. Both statements support Holt's advocacy for homeschooling and unschooling as alternatives to traditional schooling."
