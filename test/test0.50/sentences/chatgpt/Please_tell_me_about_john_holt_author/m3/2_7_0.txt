  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He believed that children learn best when they are free to pursue their own interests and passions, and that traditional schooling often stifles creativity and curiosity. Holt was born in New York City and served in the Navy during World War II. After the war, he attended Yale University and later became a teacher in the public school system. However, he became disillusioned with the system and began to write and speak out against it. In 1964, Holt published his first book, \"How Children Fail,\" which criticized the traditional education system and argued for a more child-centered approach. This was followed by several other books, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Teach Your Own,\" and \"Escape from Childhood.\"",
