  "explanation": "The statements about John Holt are not contradictory. Both statements mention his disillusionment with the traditional education system and his advocacy for alternative approaches to learning. The first statement focuses on his decision to speak out against the system, while the second statement emphasizes his shift towards writing books and articles on the topic. However, both statements ultimately support the idea that Holt was a vocal advocate for educational reform."
