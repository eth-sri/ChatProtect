  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American educator and author who is widely credited with being the founder of the modern homeschooling movement. He was born in New York City and attended Yale University, where he studied physics and engineering. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Holt worked as a freelance writer and editor in New York City. Holt became interested in education in the 1950s and began to question the traditional methods of schooling. He believed that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and discover on their own, rather than being forced to memorize information and follow strict rules. Holt's ideas about education were influenced by the work of psychologists like Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson, as well as by his own experiences as a teacher. In 1964, Holt published his first book, \"How Children Fail,\" which became a bestseller and established him as a leading voice in the education reform movement.",

Both statements mention that he went on to write several books on education, including \"How Children Learn\" and \"Teach Your Own.\" The only difference is that statement 1 includes the book \"Freedom and Beyond\" while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the information provided in the text."
