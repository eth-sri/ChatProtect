  "prefix": " John Holt (1923-1985) was an American author and educator who is best known for his advocacy of homeschooling and unschooling. He was born in New York City and studied at Yale University before serving in World War II. After the war, he became a teacher in the public school system, but soon became disillusioned with the traditional approach to education. Holt began writing and speaking about his ideas for education reform in the 1960s, and his first book, \"How Children Fail,\" was published in 1964. In it, he argued that the traditional model of education was failing children by focusing too much on rote memorization and not enough on critical thinking and creativity. Holt went on to write several more books on education, including \"How Children Learn,\" \"Freedom and Beyond,\" and \"Instead of Education.\"",

Together, they provide a more complete picture of Holt's contributions to education reform."
