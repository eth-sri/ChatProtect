  "explanation": "The statements about John Francis Daley are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information about his profession as an American actor, screenwriter, and director. The only difference is that the second statement omits the word \"film\" before \"director.\" However, this does not change the overall meaning of the statement. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
