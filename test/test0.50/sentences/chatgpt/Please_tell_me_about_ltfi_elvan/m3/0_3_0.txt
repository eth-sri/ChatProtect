  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Elvan began his political career as a member of the AKP and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 2007, while Statement 2 states that he began his political career as a member of the AKP in 2015. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about the beginning of Elvan's political career."
