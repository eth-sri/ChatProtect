  "explanation": "The statements about \"Please tell me about l\u00fctfi elvan\" are not contradictory. Both statements mention that L\u00fctfi Elvan is a Turkish politician, but statement 1 provides additional information that he is also an economist and currently holds the position of Minister of Treasury and Finance in Turkey. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
