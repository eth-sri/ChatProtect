  "explanation": "The statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his efforts to stabilize the Turkish economy and reduce inflation as the Minister of Finance and Treasury. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 1 specifically mentioning economic reforms and statement 2 using the broader term \"economic policies.\" However, both statements convey the same idea that Elvan has been working towards improving the economic situation in Turkey."
