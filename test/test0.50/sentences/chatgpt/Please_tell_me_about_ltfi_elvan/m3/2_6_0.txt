  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about L\u00fctfi Elvan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was appointed as the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs, and Communications in the 65th government of Turkey in November 2015, while statement 2 says that he was appointed to the same position in the 60th government of Turkey in 2013. These two statements cannot both be true, as they refer to different time periods and governments."
