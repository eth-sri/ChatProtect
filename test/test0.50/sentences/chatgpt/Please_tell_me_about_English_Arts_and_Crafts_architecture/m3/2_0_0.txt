  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the movement emerged in the late 19th century, but statement 1 provides additional context by explaining that it was a response to the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era. Therefore, statement 1 provides more information about the historical and cultural context of the movement, while statement 2 simply states the time period in which it emerged."
