  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made goods of the Industrial Revolution, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and a focus on the beauty of natural materials. The style is characterized by its use of traditional materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and its emphasis on handcrafted details such as intricate carvings, decorative tiles, and stained glass. It also often features asymmetrical designs, steeply pitched roofs, and large chimneys.",
