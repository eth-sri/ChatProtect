  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the importance of traditional craftsmanship and the rejection of mass production. The first statement also highlights the influence of industrialization on the emergence of this style, while the second statement focuses more on the rejection of mass-produced goods. However, both statements ultimately describe the same core values of the Arts and Crafts movement in architecture."
