Both statements emphasize the importance of traditional craftsmanship and a rejection of mass-produced goods in this architectural style. The first statement also highlights the influence of the Industrial Revolution on the emergence of this style, while the second statement focuses more on the rejection of mass-produced goods as a defining characteristic. Overall, both statements provide a well-rounded description of English Arts and Crafts architecture."
