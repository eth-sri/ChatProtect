  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in England in the late 19th century. It was a reaction against the mass-produced, machine-made goods of the Industrial Revolution, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and a focus on the beauty of natural materials. The style is characterized by its use of traditional materials such as stone, wood, and brick, and its emphasis on handcrafted details such as intricate carvings, decorative tiles, and stained glass. It also often features asymmetrical designs, steeply pitched roofs, and large chimneys. One of the key figures in the Arts and Crafts movement was William Morris, who believed that the beauty of an object lay in the way it was made, and that mass-produced goods lacked the soul and character of handcrafted items.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, as they both mention the same company founded by William Morris, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that the company produced a wide range of decorative arts, while statement 2 only mentions furniture, textiles, and other decorative arts. However, this difference does not contradict the information provided in the text about the company's production of various decorative arts."
