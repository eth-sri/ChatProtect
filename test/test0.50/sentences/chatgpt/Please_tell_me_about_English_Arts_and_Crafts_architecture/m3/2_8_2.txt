  "prefix": " English Arts and Crafts architecture was a movement that emerged in the late 19th century, as a response to the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era. It emphasized traditional craftsmanship, natural materials, and simple, functional design. The movement was led by a group of architects and designers, including William Morris, Philip Webb, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. They sought to revive traditional building techniques and materials, such as timber framing, thatch, and handcrafted tiles. English Arts and Crafts architecture is characterized by a number of features, including steeply pitched roofs, asymmetrical facades, and the use of local materials such as stone, brick, and timber. Many buildings also feature decorative elements such as carved woodwork, stained glass, and intricate tile work. One of the most famous examples of English Arts and Crafts architecture is the Red House in Bexleyheath, designed by William Morris and Philip Webb in 1859. The house features a steeply pitched roof, exposed timber framing, and intricate tile work.",
