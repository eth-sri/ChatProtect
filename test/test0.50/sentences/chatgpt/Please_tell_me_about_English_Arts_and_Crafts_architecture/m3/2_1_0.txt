  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the importance of traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials in this architectural movement. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions the emphasis on simple, functional design, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the idea that English Arts and Crafts architecture prioritized traditional craftsmanship and natural materials."
