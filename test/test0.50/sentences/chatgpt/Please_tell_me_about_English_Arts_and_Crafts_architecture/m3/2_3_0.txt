It emphasized traditional craftsmanship, natural materials, and simple, functional design. The movement was led by a group of architects and designers, including William Morris, Philip Webb, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh.",

  "explanation": "The statements about English Arts and Crafts architecture are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize the movement's focus on reviving traditional building techniques and materials, such as timber framing and thatch. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions handcrafted tiles, while statement 2 does not. However, this does not contradict the overall message that the movement sought to revive traditional techniques and styles of building."
