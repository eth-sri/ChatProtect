It was a reaction against the industrialization and mass production of the Victorian era, and was characterized by a return to traditional craftsmanship and the use of natural materials. The style is known for its use of local materials such as stone, brick, and timber, and its emphasis on the use of hand-crafted details such as decorative tiles, stained glass, and carved woodwork.",
