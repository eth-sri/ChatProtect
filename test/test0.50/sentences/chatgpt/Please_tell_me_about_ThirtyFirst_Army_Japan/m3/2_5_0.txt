It was formed on August 9, 1944, under the Southern Expeditionary Army Group, and was tasked with defending the southern regions of the Japanese-occupied territories in Southeast Asia. The Thirty-First Army was initially stationed in the Philippines, where it was involved in fierce fighting against American and Filipino forces during the Battle of Leyte. Despite initial successes, the army was eventually defeated and forced to retreat to the island of Mindanao. In 1945, the Thirty-First Army was transferred to the Japanese home islands to defend against the expected Allied invasion.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory as they provide different dates for the army's disbandment following Japan's surrender. Statement 1 states that the army was disbanded on August 15, 1945, while Statement 2 states that it was disbanded on September 2, 1945. These dates are not consistent with each other, and only one of them can be correct."
