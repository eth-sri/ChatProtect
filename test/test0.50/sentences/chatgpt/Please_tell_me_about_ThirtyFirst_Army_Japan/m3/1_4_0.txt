  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that the army was on its way to the Philippines but was unable to reach its destination due to Japan's surrender. On the other hand, statement 2 implies that the army could not reach the Philippines due to logistical problems and Japan's surrender. While both statements mention Japan's surrender, they provide different reasons for why the Thirty-First Army did not reach the Philippines."
