  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the atomic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan's surrender, but they provide different perspectives. Statement 1 focuses on the fact that the army was not able to fulfill its mission due to the sudden end of the war, while Statement 2 emphasizes the role of the atomic bombs in ending the war. Both statements are true and complement each other in providing a fuller picture of the events surrounding the Thirty-First Army."
