  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that despite General Yamashita's successful campaigns in Malaya and Singapore, the Thirty-First Army was not able to prevent the American invasion of the Philippines due to being understaffed and poorly equipped. Statement 2 explains that the Thirty-First Army was disbanded following Japan's surrender to the Allied Powers, which is a logical consequence of the end of World War II. Both statements provide additional information about the Thirty-First Army without contradicting each other."
