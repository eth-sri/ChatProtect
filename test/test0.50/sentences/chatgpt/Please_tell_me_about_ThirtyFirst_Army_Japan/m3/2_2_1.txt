  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. The first statement mentions the army's involvement in the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines, while the second statement mentions its involvement in the Battle of Okinawa. Both battles took place during World War II and involved the Thirty-First Army fighting against Allied forces. The second statement notes that the army suffered heavy losses and was ultimately defeated, which is not contradictory to the first statement's mention of the army's involvement in fierce fighting."
