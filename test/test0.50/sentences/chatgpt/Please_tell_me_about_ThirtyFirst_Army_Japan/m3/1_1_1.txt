  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. The army was initially assigned to defend the southern coast of China against a possible Allied invasion, but later it was reassigned to defend the northern front of Japan against a possible Soviet invasion. Therefore, both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
