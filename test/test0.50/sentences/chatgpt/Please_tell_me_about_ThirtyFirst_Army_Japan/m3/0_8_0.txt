  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on April 6, 1944, and was primarily responsible for the defense of the northern Philippines, including the islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan. The Thirty-First Army was commanded by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who was known for his successful campaigns in Malaya and Singapore. However, the Thirty-First Army was understaffed and poorly equipped, and Yamashita was unable to prevent the American invasion of the Philippines. The Battle of Luzon, which began in January 1945, was the largest and most intense battle fought by the Thirty-First Army. Despite putting up a fierce resistance, the Japanese were eventually overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the American forces. Yamashita was forced to retreat to the mountains, where he continued to resist until his surrender in September 1945. The Thirty-First Army was officially disbanded on September 2, 1945, following the Japanese surrender.",
