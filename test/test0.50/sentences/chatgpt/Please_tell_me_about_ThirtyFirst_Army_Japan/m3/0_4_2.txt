  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. They both provide information about the Battle of Luzon, which was the largest and most intense battle fought by the Thirty-First Army. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 begins with the battle and then provides context about the Thirty-First Army, while Statement 2 begins with the Thirty-First Army and then provides information about the battle."
