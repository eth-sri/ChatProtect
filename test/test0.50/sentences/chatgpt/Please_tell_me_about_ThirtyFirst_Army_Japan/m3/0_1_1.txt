  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. Statement 1 states that the army was primarily responsible for the defense of the northern Philippines, while Statement 2 states that it was responsible for the defense of the northern part of the Japanese home islands. These are two different geographical locations, and therefore cannot both be true."
