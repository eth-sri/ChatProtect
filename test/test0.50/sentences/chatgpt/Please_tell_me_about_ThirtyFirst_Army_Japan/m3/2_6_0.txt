  "prefix": " The Thirty-First Army was a field army of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was formed on August 9, 1944, under the Southern Expeditionary Army Group, and was tasked with defending the southern regions of the Japanese-occupied territories in Southeast Asia. The Thirty-First Army was initially stationed in the Philippines, where it was involved in fierce fighting against American and Filipino forces during the Battle of Leyte. Despite initial successes, the army was eventually defeated and forced to retreat to the island of Mindanao. In 1945, the Thirty-First Army was transferred to the Japanese home islands to defend against the expected Allied invasion. However, the army was unable to effectively resist the overwhelming Allied forces and was ultimately disbanded on August 15, 1945, following Japan's surrender.",
