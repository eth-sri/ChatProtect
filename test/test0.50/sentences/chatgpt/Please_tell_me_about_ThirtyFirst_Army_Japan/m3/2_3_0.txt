  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. The first statement explains that the army was initially successful but eventually defeated and forced to retreat to the island of Mindanao. The second statement adds that the army was later forced to retreat to the Japanese home islands and disbanded. Both statements are consistent with the army's history during World War II."
