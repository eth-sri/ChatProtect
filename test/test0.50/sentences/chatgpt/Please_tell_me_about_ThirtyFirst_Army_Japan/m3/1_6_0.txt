It was established on February 5, 1944, and was initially assigned to defend the southern coast of China against a possible Allied invasion. The army was composed of two divisions, the 41st and the 64th, and was headquartered in Canton, China. In August 1945, the Thirty-First Army was ordered to move to the Philippines to reinforce Japanese forces there. However, before the army could arrive, the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945. The Thirty-First Army was disbanded soon after.",

  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Both statements mention the army's involvement in battles in China, including the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou and the Battle of West Hunan. Statement 1 expands on this by adding that the army was involved in several other battles and skirmishes, while Statement 2 focuses specifically on the army's involvement in major battles in China. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide additional information about the Thirty-First Army's activities during World War II."
