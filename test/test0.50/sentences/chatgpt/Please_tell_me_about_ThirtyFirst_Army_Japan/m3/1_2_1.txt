  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are contradictory. The first statement mentions that the army was headquartered in Canton, China, while the second statement mentions that it was headquartered in Guangzhou, China. However, Canton and Guangzhou are two different names for the same city. Therefore, the two statements are referring to the same location and are not contradictory in terms of the location of the army's headquarters."
