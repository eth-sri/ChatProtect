  "explanation": "The statements about the Thirty-First Army (Japan) are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that the army was ordered to move to the Philippines but was unable to do so due to Japan's surrender after the atomic bombs were dropped. Statement 2 confirms that the army surrendered to the Allied forces, which is consistent with the end of World War II. Both statements provide additional information about the army's actions and fate during the war."
