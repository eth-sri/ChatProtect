Economic relations between Brazil and Angola have been growing steadily over the years. Brazil is one of Angola's main trading partners, and the two countries have signed several agreements to boost trade and investment. Brazil exports a range of products to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products. In return, Angola exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil.

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Brazil has provided assistance to Angola in various areas such as health, education, and agriculture. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that Brazil has provided technical assistance in these sectors. However, this does not contradict statement 1, which does not specify the type of assistance provided. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide additional information about the cooperation between Brazil and Angola."
