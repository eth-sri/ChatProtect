  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Brazil is one of Angola's main trading partners, which is a key aspect of their diplomatic and economic relations. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that the two countries have signed agreements to boost trade and investment, while statement 2 simply states the fact. However, both statements are consistent with the idea that Brazil and Angola have a strong economic relationship."
