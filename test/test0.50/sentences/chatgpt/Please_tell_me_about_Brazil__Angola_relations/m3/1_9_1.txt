  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have maintained diplomatic relations since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The two countries have a history of cooperation in various fields, including trade, investment, education, and cultural exchange. Brazil is Angola's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $3.5 billion in 2019. Brazilian companies have invested heavily in Angola's oil and gas sector, as well as in agriculture, infrastructure, and telecommunications. Angola, in turn, exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil. The two countries also cooperate in the fields of education and culture. Brazil has provided scholarships to Angolan students to study at Brazilian universities, and has also sent teachers to Angola to teach Portuguese. Additionally, there are cultural exchange programs that promote the exchange of music, dance, and other art forms between the two countries. However, the relationship between Brazil and Angola has not been without its challenges.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight the issue of corruption scandals involving Brazilian companies operating in Angola, which have strained the relationship between the two countries. However, the first statement is more general, while the second statement specifically mentions corruption scandals involving Brazilian construction companies. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of the challenges facing Brazil-Angola relations."
