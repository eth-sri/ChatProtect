Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize its independence. Since then, the two countries have maintained friendly relations and have cooperated in various fields such as trade, education, and culture. Economic relations between Brazil and Angola have been growing steadily over the years. Brazil is one of Angola's main trading partners, and the two countries have signed several agreements to boost trade and investment. Brazil exports a range of products to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products. In return, Angola exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil. Cultural exchanges between Brazil and Angola have also been significant. Brazil has a large Afro-Brazilian population, and there are many cultural similarities between the two countries.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the cultural exchanges between the two countries and how they have influenced each other's cultures. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes the organized events and festivals that promote Brazilian culture in Angola, while statement 1 simply states that Angolan culture has also influenced Brazilian culture. However, both statements support the idea that there is a significant cultural exchange between Brazil and Angola."
