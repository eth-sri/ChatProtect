  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. They both convey the same information that Brazil and Angola have had diplomatic relations since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The only difference is in the phrasing of the second statement, which uses \"Angola's independence\" instead of \"Angola gained independence.\" However, this difference in phrasing does not change the meaning of the statement."
