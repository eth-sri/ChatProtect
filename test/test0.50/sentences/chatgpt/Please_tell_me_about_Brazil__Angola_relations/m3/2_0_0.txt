  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Brazil and Angola have had a relationship since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. The first statement emphasizes the long-standing nature of this relationship, while the second statement specifically mentions the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1975. Together, these statements provide complementary information about the history of Brazil \u2013 Angola relations."
