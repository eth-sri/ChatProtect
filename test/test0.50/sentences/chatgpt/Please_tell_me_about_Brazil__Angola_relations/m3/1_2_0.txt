  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but rather provide slightly different information. Both statements highlight the importance of Brazil as a trading partner for Angola, with bilateral trade reaching billions of dollars in 2019. The only difference is in the exact amount of trade mentioned, with statement 1 citing $3.5 billion and statement 2 citing over $3 billion. However, this difference is not significant enough to contradict each other."
