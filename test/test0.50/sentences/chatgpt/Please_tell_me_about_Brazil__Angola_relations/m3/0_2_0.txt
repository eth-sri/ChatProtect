Both statements highlight the friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries, with a focus on areas such as trade, investment, education, and culture. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions \"various fields\" while statement 2 specifically mentions \"trade, investment, and cultural exchange.\" However, this does not contradict the overall message of the two statements."
