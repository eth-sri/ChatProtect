Economic relations between Brazil and Angola have been growing steadily over the years. Brazil is one of Angola's main trading partners, and the two countries have signed several agreements to boost trade and investment. Brazil exports a range of products to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products. In return, Angola exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil.
