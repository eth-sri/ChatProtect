  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's independence or sovereignty after it gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The only difference is in the use of the word \"independence\" versus \"sovereignty\", which are often used interchangeably in international relations. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about the historical relationship between Brazil and Angola."
