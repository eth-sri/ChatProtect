  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola share a long history of diplomatic and economic relations. Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize its independence. Since then, the two countries have maintained friendly relations and have cooperated in various fields such as trade, education, and culture. Economic relations between Brazil and Angola have been growing steadily over the years. Brazil is one of Angola's main trading partners, and the two countries have signed several agreements to boost trade and investment. Brazil exports a range of products to Angola, including machinery, vehicles, and food products.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention Angola's exports to Brazil, with statement 1 providing a broader range of products and statement 2 specifically mentioning oil. It is possible that Angola exports other minerals in addition to oil, which would make both statements accurate. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
