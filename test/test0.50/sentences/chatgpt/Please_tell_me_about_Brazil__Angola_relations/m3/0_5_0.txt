Brazil is one of Angola's main trading partners, and the two countries have signed several agreements to boost trade and investment.",

  "explanation": "The statements are not contradictory, but rather offer slightly different information. Both statements mention that Brazil exports machinery, vehicles, and food products to Angola, but statement 2 adds that Brazil also exports chemicals. Therefore, statement 2 provides a more comprehensive list of the goods that Brazil exports to Angola."
