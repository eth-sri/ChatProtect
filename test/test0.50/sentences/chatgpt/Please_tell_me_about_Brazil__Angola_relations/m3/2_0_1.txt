  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. While Statement 1 refers to the diplomatic relationship between the two countries after Angola gained independence from Portugal, Statement 2 highlights the historical ties between Brazil and Angola that date back to the 16th century when Angola was a Portuguese colony and slaves were brought to Brazil. Both statements provide different perspectives on the relationship between the two countries, but they do not contradict each other."
