  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that diplomatic relations between Brazil and Angola were established in 1975 when Angola gained independence from Portugal. The only difference is in the phrasing of the sentence. Statement 1 uses the phrase \"maintained diplomatic relations\" while Statement 2 uses the phrase \"established diplomatic relations\". However, both phrases convey the same meaning that diplomatic relations were established and have been maintained since then."
