Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's independence and has since maintained diplomatic relations with the African nation. Trade and investment have been the main drivers of the bilateral relationship. Brazil is Angola's second-largest trading partner after China, and Angola is Brazil's main trading partner in Africa. The two countries have signed several agreements to promote trade and investment, including a Bilateral Investment Treaty and a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Brazil has provided technical assistance to Angola in various fields, including agriculture, health, and education. The only difference is in the use of the word \"training\" in statement 1, which is not present in statement 2. However, this does not change the overall meaning of the statements or contradict each other."
