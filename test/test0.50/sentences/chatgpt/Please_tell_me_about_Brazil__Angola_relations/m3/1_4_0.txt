  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Statement 1 highlights the variety of products that Angola exports to Brazil, including crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals. Statement 2 emphasizes the importance of crude oil as the main export from Angola to Brazil, which accounts for the majority of the bilateral trade between the two countries. Together, these statements provide a more complete picture of the economic relationship between Brazil and Angola, showing both the diversity of products traded and the significant role of crude oil in their trade partnership."
