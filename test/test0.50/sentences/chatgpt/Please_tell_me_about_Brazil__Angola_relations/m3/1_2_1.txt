  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that bilateral trade between the two countries reached $3.5 billion in 2019, while Statement 2 states that it was $2.3 billion in the same year. These two figures cannot both be true, indicating a contradiction."
