  "explanation": "The two statements about Brazil \u2013 Angola relations are not contradictory. They both highlight the fact that Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. The only difference is that Statement 1 provides additional context by mentioning that Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, while Statement 2 simply states that Brazil recognized Angola's independence. Overall, both statements support the idea that Brazil and Angola have a strong history of diplomatic relations."
