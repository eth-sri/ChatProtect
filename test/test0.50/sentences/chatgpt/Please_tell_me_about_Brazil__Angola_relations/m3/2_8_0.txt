  "prefix": " Brazil and Angola have a long-standing relationship that dates back to Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's independence and has since maintained diplomatic relations with the African nation. Trade and investment have been the main drivers of the bilateral relationship. Brazil is Angola's second-largest trading partner after China, and Angola is Brazil's main trading partner in Africa. The two countries have signed several agreements to promote trade and investment, including a Bilateral Investment Treaty and a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. Brazil has also provided technical assistance and training to Angola in various fields, including agriculture, health, and education. Brazilian companies have invested in Angola's oil and gas sector, infrastructure, and telecommunications, among other areas. Cultural exchanges have also been an important aspect of the relationship.",
