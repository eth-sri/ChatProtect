Brazil is Angola's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $3.5 billion in 2019. Brazilian companies have invested heavily in Angola's oil and gas sector, as well as in agriculture, infrastructure, and telecommunications. Angola, in turn, exports crude oil, diamonds, and other minerals to Brazil. The two countries also cooperate in the fields of education and culture. Brazil has provided scholarships to Angolan students to study at Brazilian universities, and has also sent teachers to Angola to teach Portuguese.",
