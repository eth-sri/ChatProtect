  "explanation": "The statements about Brazil-Angola relations are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Brazil was one of the first countries to recognize Angola's independence, which highlights the importance of the relationship between the two nations. The first statement goes on to mention that Brazil has maintained diplomatic relations with Angola since then, providing further context about the nature of the relationship. However, the second statement does not provide any additional information beyond the fact that Brazil recognized Angola's independence early on."
