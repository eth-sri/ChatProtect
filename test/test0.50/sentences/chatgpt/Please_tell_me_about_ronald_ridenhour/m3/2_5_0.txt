  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier and whistleblower who exposed the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. He was born on April 6, 1946, in Oakland, California, and served in the United States Army from 1967 to 1968. In March 1968, Ridenhour heard rumors of a massacre of civilians by American soldiers in the village of My Lai. He was shocked by the reports and decided to investigate further. He interviewed several soldiers who had been present during the incident and obtained evidence that confirmed the massacre had indeed taken place.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour wrote a letter detailing the My Lai Massacre to various government officials, including the President, Congress, and the Pentagon. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which adds that Ridenhour called for an investigation. However, this does not contradict the first statement, which implies that Ridenhour's letter also detailed the atrocities committed by American soldiers in My Lai. Overall, both statements provide complementary information about Ridenhour's actions as a whistleblower."
