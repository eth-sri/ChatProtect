  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize that Ridenhour spent a significant amount of time investigating and gathering evidence about the My Lai massacre before going public with the story. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions \"several years\" while statement 2 simply states \"years.\" However, this difference in wording does not contradict the overall message conveyed in both statements."
