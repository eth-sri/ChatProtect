  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that he was a soldier who served in the Vietnam War. The only difference is that the first statement specifies that he was a former soldier, while the second statement simply refers to him as a veteran. However, this difference in wording does not contradict the information conveyed in either statement."
