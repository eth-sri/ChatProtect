In March 1968, Ridenhour heard rumors of a massacre of civilians by American soldiers in the village of My Lai. He was shocked by the reports and decided to investigate further. He interviewed several soldiers who had been present during the incident and obtained evidence that confirmed the massacre had indeed taken place. Ridenhour wrote a letter to President Nixon, the Pentagon, and several members of Congress detailing the atrocities committed by American soldiers in My Lai.",
