  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour and the My Lai massacre are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about the same event - the mass killing of unarmed Vietnamese civilians by U.S. Army soldiers in 1968. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that the civilians were from South Vietnam and the date of the massacre. However, this does not contradict the information provided in statement 1."
