  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour wrote a letter to President Nixon detailing the My Lai Massacre and calling for an investigation into the incident. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that Ridenhour also sent the letter to the Pentagon and several members of Congress, while statement 2 only mentions the letter being sent to President Nixon. However, this difference does not contradict the information provided in either statement."
