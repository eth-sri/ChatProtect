  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ronald Ridenhour are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that Ridenhour was not involved in the My Lai massacre and only learned about it after the fact, while statement 2 suggests that he had prior knowledge of the massacre through his fellow soldiers who participated in it. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
