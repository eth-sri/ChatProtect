  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Ridenhour began investigating the My Lai Massacre and gathering evidence to bring attention to the incident. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes Ridenhour's emotional reaction to hearing about the massacre, while statement 2 emphasizes his intention to bring the evidence to his superiors. However, both statements ultimately convey the same information about Ridenhour's actions in response to the My Lai Massacre."
