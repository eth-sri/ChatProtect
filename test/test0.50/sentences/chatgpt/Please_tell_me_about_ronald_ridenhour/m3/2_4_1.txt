Both statements confirm that Ridenhour's investigation confirmed the occurrence of the My Lai Massacre, which he had heard rumors about. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about how Ridenhour obtained evidence to confirm the massacre, while statement 2 simply states that his investigation confirmed it."
