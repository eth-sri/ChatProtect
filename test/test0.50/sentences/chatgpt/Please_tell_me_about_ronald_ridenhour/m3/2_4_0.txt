  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he interviewed soldiers who were present during the My Lai Massacre and gathered evidence to confirm that the massacre had taken place. The only difference is in the wording used to describe the evidence he obtained. Statement 1 says he obtained evidence that confirmed the massacre had taken place, while Statement 2 says he gathered evidence to support the claims. However, both statements convey the same idea that Ridenhour played a crucial role in exposing the truth about the My Lai Massacre."
