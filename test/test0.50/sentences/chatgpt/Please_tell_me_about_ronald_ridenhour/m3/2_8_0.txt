  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was an American soldier and whistleblower who exposed the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. He was born on April 6, 1946, in Oakland, California, and served in the United States Army from 1967 to 1968. In March 1968, Ridenhour heard rumors of a massacre of civilians by American soldiers in the village of My Lai. He was shocked by the reports and decided to investigate further. He interviewed several soldiers who had been present during the incident and obtained evidence that confirmed the massacre had indeed taken place. Ridenhour wrote a letter to President Nixon, the Pentagon, and several members of Congress detailing the atrocities committed by American soldiers in My Lai. His letter eventually led to an investigation and the prosecution of several soldiers involved in the massacre. Ridenhour's actions exposed the brutal reality of the Vietnam War and the injustices committed by American soldiers.",
