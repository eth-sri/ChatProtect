  "prefix": " Ronald Ridenhour was a former soldier in the United States Army during the Vietnam War. He is best known for his role in exposing the My Lai Massacre, a war crime committed by American soldiers in 1968. Ridenhour first heard about the massacre from fellow soldiers who had been involved in the operation. Shocked and appalled by what he had heard, Ridenhour began investigating the incident and gathering evidence. He eventually wrote a letter to several high-ranking government officials, including President Nixon, detailing the massacre and calling for an investigation. Ridenhour's letter sparked an official inquiry into the My Lai Massacre, which resulted in the prosecution of several soldiers involved in the incident. His bravery and dedication to exposing the truth helped to bring about justice for the victims of the massacre and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.",
