  "explanation": "The statements about Ronald Ridenhour are not contradictory, but they provide different information about how he learned about the My Lai massacre. Statement 1 suggests that Ridenhour heard about the massacre from soldiers who were not directly involved in the operation, while Statement 2 suggests that he heard about it from soldiers who were part of the unit responsible for the killings. Both statements, however, agree that Ridenhour played a crucial role in exposing the massacre and bringing it to the attention of the public."
