However, when the Mongols invaded Song territory in 1275, he resigned from his post and joined the military to fight against the invaders.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. They both provide the same information about his capture by the Mongols in 1278 and his subsequent transportation to the Mongol capital, but use slightly different wording to describe the location of the capital. \"Modern-day\" and \"present-day\" are interchangeable phrases that mean the same thing, so the statements do not contradict each other."
