  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and poet who lived during the Southern Song Dynasty. He was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, and was known for his loyalty and patriotism towards the Song Dynasty. Wen Tianxiang served in various government positions, including as the Minister of Personnel and the Minister of War. He was a skilled military strategist and was responsible for several victories against the invading Mongol armies. In 1278, Wen Tianxiang was captured by the Mongols during a battle and was taken to the capital of the Yuan Dynasty, where he was offered a high-ranking position in the Mongol government. However, he refused to betray his loyalty to the Song Dynasty and was subsequently executed. Wen Tianxiang is also known for his poetry, which expressed his love for his country and his determination to resist the Mongol invasion.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. They both refer to his most famous work, \"Song of Righteousness,\" and highlight its significance as a symbol of Chinese patriotism and resistance against foreign aggression/invasion. The only difference is the use of the word \"aggression\" in statement 1 and \"invasion\" in statement 2, but both words convey the same idea of foreign attack and aggression towards China. Therefore, the statements are consistent with each other."
