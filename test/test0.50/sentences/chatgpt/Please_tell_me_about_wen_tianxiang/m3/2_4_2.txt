  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory, but rather present two different options that he faced when captured by the Mongols. Statement 1 states that he was offered a high-ranking position in the Mongol government, while Statement 2 explains that he refused to serve the foreign rulers and remained loyal to the Song Dynasty until his death. These statements show the difficult decision that Wen Tianxiang had to make and highlight his unwavering loyalty to his country."
