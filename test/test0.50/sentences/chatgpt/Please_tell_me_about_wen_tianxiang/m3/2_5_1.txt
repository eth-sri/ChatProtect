  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his unwavering loyalty to the Song Dynasty and his refusal to betray his country, even when faced with the offer of a high-ranking position in the Mongol government. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions his subsequent execution, while statement 2 focuses on his decision to remain loyal. However, both statements ultimately convey the same message about Wen Tianxiang's loyalty and patriotism."
