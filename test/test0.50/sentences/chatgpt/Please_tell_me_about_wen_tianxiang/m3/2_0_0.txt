  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory, as they both mention that he was a scholar, military general, and lived during the Song Dynasty in China. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that he lived during the Southern Song Dynasty, while statement 2 mentions the late Song Dynasty in general. However, this does not contradict the information in statement 1."
