  "explanation": "The two statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements emphasize his loyalty to the Song Dynasty and his refusal to betray it, even when offered a high-ranking position in the Mongol government. The only difference between the two statements is that the second one provides more detail about the offer and his subsequent execution."
