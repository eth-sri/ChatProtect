He is best known for his role in resisting the Mongol invasion of China and his literary works, particularly his famous poem \"Song of Righteousness\" (also known as \"Song of Righteousness and Loyalty\"). Wen was born into a family of scholars and officials in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province. He passed the imperial examination and was appointed as a government official, serving in various positions throughout his career. In 1276, Wen was appointed as the chief military advisor to the emperor and was tasked with leading the defense against the Mongol army. Despite being outnumbered and outmatched, Wen led his troops in a valiant defense of the city of Xiangyang for over a year. When the city finally fell to the Mongols in 1277, Wen was captured and taken as a prisoner to the Mongol capital of Dadu (present-day Beijing). During his captivity, Wen refused to submit to the Mongols and continued to advocate for resistance against them.",
