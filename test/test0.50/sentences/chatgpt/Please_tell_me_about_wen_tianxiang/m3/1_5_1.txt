  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. The first statement highlights his loyalty to the Song Dynasty and his refusal to collaborate with the enemy, even when offered high positions and wealth. The second statement mentions his capture by the Mongols and his imprisonment in Dadu until his death in 1283. Both statements are consistent with his unwavering loyalty to his country and his willingness to sacrifice his own well-being for the greater good."
