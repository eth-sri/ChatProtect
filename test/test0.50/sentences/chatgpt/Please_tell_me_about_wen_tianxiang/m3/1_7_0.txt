  "prefix": " Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283) was a Chinese scholar, military general, and statesman during the Song Dynasty. He was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, and was known for his loyalty to the Song Dynasty and his resistance against the Mongol invasion. Wen Tianxiang was a prominent scholar and poet, and he was appointed as the Minister of Personnel in the Song court. However, when the Mongols invaded Song territory in 1275, he resigned from his post and joined the military to fight against the invaders. Wen Tianxiang was captured by the Mongols in 1278 and was taken to the Mongol capital of Dadu (modern-day Beijing). Despite being offered high positions and wealth, he refused to collaborate with the enemy and remained loyal to the Song Dynasty. He was eventually executed in 1283 for his refusal to submit to the Mongols.",
