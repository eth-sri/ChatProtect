  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information about his occupation and the time period in which he lived. The only difference is the use of the word \"late\" in the second statement, which implies that Wen Tianxiang lived towards the end of the Song Dynasty. However, this does not contradict the first statement, which also indicates that he lived during the Song Dynasty."
