  "explanation": "The statements about Wen Tianxiang are not contradictory, but they emphasize different aspects of his life and legacy. Both statements acknowledge his patriotism and resistance against the Mongol invasion, but statement 1 also highlights his literary achievements and his role as a statesman and military general, while statement 2 focuses more narrowly on his refusal to surrender. Overall, both statements contribute to a more complete understanding of Wen Tianxiang's significance in Chinese history."
