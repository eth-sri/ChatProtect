  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements highlight different aspects of his involvement in social and political causes. The first statement emphasizes his advocacy for social reform, including the abolition of slavery and improving working conditions. The second statement highlights his collaboration with Queen Victoria on charitable causes, specifically the Great Exhibition of 1851. Both statements complement each other and provide a more comprehensive understanding of Prince Albert's contributions to society."
