  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. They simply provide additional information about his life and interests beyond his military career and family. The fact that he served as a member of the German Reichstag and was interested in agriculture does not contradict his military background or his role as a prince. In fact, it shows that he had a diverse range of interests and was involved in various aspects of society."
