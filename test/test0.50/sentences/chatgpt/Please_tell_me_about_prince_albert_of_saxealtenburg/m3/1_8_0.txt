  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his advocacy for social and educational reform and his efforts to improve the living and working conditions of the people of Great Britain. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which specifies that he worked to improve the conditions of the working class in Britain. However, both statements convey the same idea that Prince Albert was committed to social and educational reform and worked to improve the lives of the people of Great Britain."
