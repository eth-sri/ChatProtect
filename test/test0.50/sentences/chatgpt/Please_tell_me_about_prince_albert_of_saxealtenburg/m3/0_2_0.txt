  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. The first statement mentions that he served in the army during the Schleswig-Holstein War in 1848, while the second statement mentions that he served in the army of Saxony. These two armies are different, and therefore the statements cannot both be true."
