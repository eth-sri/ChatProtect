  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that he served in the army during the Schleswig-Holstein War in 1848, while statement 2 mentions that he served as a general in the Prussian army. However, the Schleswig-Holstein War was fought between Denmark and the German Confederation, which included Prussia. Therefore, it is unlikely that Prince Albert could have served in the army during that war and also served as a general in the Prussian army."
