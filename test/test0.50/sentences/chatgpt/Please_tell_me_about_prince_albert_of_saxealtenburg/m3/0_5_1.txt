  "explanation": "The two statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. They both provide information about his family and specifically mention his son, Prince Ernst II, who succeeded him as the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. The only difference is the order in which the information is presented. Statement 1 mentions the couple's children first, while Statement 2 mentions Prince Albert's children after introducing him."
