  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his contributions to British society, his partnership with Queen Victoria, his support for education and the arts, and his advocacy for social reform. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions his role in shaping the Victorian era, while statement 2 emphasizes his cultural and social contributions. However, both statements are consistent in their overall portrayal of Prince Albert as a significant figure in British history."
