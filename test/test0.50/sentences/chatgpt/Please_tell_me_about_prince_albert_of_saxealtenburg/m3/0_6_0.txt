  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are not contradictory. The first statement highlights his interest in art and literature and his support for cultural institutions, while the second statement focuses on his support for the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership. These two aspects of his life are not mutually exclusive and can coexist. In fact, many individuals who support cultural development also support political unification and vice versa. Therefore, the statements do not contradict each other."
