  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory as they provide different dates of his death and ages at the time of his death. Statement 1 states that he died on December 14, 1861, at the age of 42, while statement 2 states that he died on December 14, 1902, at the age of 83. These two statements cannot both be true, and therefore, they are contradictory."
