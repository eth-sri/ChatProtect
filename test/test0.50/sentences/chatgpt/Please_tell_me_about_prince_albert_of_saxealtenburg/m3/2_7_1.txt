  "explanation": "The statements about Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he died at the age of 42 due to poor health, while statement 2 says that he died at the age of 83. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different ages of death for Prince Albert."
