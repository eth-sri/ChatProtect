  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Charles Townsend Blackfan receiving his medical degree from Harvard Medical School are contradictory. Statement 1 says he received his degree in 1907, while statement 2 says he received it in 1908. Only one of these statements can be true, so they cannot both be accurate."
