  "explanation": "The statements about Charles Townsend Blackfan are not contradictory, but they do present slightly different information. Statement 1 specifically mentions that Blackfan developed a treatment using liver extract for anemia in infants caused by a deficiency in iron, while Statement 2 simply states that Blackfan discovered that anemia in infants was caused by a lack of iron in their diet. Both statements acknowledge Blackfan's contribution to understanding and treating anemia in infants, but Statement 1 provides more detail about his specific treatment approach."
