  "explanation": "The statements about Charles Townsend Blackfan are contradictory. The first statement states that he was born in Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School, while the second statement specifies that he was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. Since Worcester is a city in Massachusetts, the second statement contradicts the first statement's implication that Blackfan was born somewhere else in the state."
