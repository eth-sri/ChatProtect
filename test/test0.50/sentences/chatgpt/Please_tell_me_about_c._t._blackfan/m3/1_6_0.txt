He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan is best known for his work on anemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells. He was one of the first researchers to identify the cause of anemia as a deficiency in iron, and he developed a treatment using liver extract that was effective in many cases. Blackfan also made important contributions to the study of sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells. He was one of the first researchers to describe the symptoms and complications of the disease, and he developed a method for diagnosing it.",
