He was born in Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan is best known for his research on anemia, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency in iron, and he developed a treatment using liver extract that proved to be very effective. Blackfan also studied the genetic basis of blood disorders, particularly sickle cell anemia.",
