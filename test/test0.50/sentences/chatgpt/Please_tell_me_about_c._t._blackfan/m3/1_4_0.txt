He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan is best known for his work on anemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells. He was one of the first researchers to identify the cause of anemia as a deficiency in iron, and he developed a treatment using liver extract that was effective in many cases.",
