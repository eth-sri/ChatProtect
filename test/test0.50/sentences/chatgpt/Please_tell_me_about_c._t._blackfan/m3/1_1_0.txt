  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Charles Townsend Blackfan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907, while statement 2 says that he received it in 1908. Since the two statements provide different years for the same event, they cannot both be true."
