  "prefix": " C.T. Blackfan, also known as Charles Townsend Blackfan, was an American pediatrician and hematologist who made significant contributions to the understanding and treatment of blood disorders in children. He was born on December 1, 1883, in Boston, Massachusetts, and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1908. Blackfan's research focused on the causes and treatment of anemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a lack of iron in their diets and developed a treatment that involved giving them iron supplements. He also studied sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells.",
