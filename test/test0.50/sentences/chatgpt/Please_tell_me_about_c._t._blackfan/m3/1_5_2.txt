  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1965) was an American pediatrician and hematologist who made significant contributions to the field of hematology. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan is best known for his work on anemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough red blood cells. He was one of the first researchers to identify the cause of anemia as a deficiency in iron, and he developed a treatment using liver extract that was effective in many cases. Blackfan also made important contributions to the study of sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells.",
