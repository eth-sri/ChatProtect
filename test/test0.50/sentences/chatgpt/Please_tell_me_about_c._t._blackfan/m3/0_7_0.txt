  "prefix": " Charles Townsend Blackfan (1883-1965) was an American pediatrician and hematologist who made significant contributions to the field of blood disorders. He was born in Massachusetts and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1907. Blackfan is best known for his research on anemia, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin. He discovered that anemia in infants was often caused by a deficiency in iron, and he developed a treatment using liver extract that proved to be very effective. Blackfan also studied the genetic basis of blood disorders, particularly sickle cell anemia. He was one of the first researchers to identify the abnormal hemoglobin molecule that causes the disease. In addition to his research, Blackfan was a dedicated physician who worked tirelessly to improve the health of children.",
