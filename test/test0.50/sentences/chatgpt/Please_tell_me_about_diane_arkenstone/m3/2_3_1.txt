  "explanation": "The statements about Diane Arkenstone are not contradictory. Both statements mention that she has released over 20 albums, which is consistent. The first statement adds that she has collaborated with other musicians, while the second statement does not mention collaborations. However, this does not contradict the first statement, as it is possible for both statements to be true at the same time."
