  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements mention that it is a popular Bengali television series/soap opera, with the only difference being the specific term used to describe it. \"Drama series\" and \"soap opera\" are often used interchangeably to refer to serialized television shows with ongoing storylines and character development. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
