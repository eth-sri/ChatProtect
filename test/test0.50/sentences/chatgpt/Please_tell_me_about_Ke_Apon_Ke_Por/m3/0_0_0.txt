  "explanation": "The statements about Ke Apon Ke Por are not contradictory. Both statements describe the same television series, but use different terms to refer to it. \"Drama series\" and \"soap opera\" are both commonly used to describe serialized television shows with ongoing storylines and character development. Therefore, the two statements are simply using different terminology to describe the same thing."
