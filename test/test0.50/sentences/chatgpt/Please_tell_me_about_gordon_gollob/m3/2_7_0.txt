The first statement says that he worked as a businessman and aviation consultant after his release from prison, while the second statement says that he worked as a businessman in Germany. The second statement does not mention his work as an aviation consultant, which is mentioned in the first statement. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
