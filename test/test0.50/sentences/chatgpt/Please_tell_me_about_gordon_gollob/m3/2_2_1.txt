Statement 1 suggests that Gollob joined the Luftwaffe in 1935 and served as a reconnaissance pilot, while Statement 2 simply states that he served in the Luftwaffe in 1935 without any mention of his role. Additionally, Statement 1 provides more detailed information about Gollob's early career, while Statement 2 is a more general statement that could apply to any period of time in which Gollob served in the Luftwaffe."
