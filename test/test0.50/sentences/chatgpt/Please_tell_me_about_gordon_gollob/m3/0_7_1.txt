  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about his post-war life, specifically that he was captured by the Allies and spent time in prison as a prisoner of war. The first statement does not specify which Allied forces captured him, while the second statement specifies that he was captured by the British. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Gollob as a prisoner of war after the war ended."
