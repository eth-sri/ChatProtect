  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. The first statement states that he was born in Vienna, Austria, while the second statement states that he was born in Wroc\u0142aw, which was then part of Germany. These two locations are not the same, and therefore the statements cannot both be true."
