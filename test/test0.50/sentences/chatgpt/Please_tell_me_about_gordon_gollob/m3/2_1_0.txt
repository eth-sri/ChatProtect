  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. They both provide the same information about Gordon Gollob's service in the Luftwaffe and his credited 150 aerial victories during World War II. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which uses \"aerial victories\" instead of \"shooting down\" enemy aircraft."
