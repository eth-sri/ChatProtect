  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was credited with shooting down 150 enemy aircraft, but statement 1 specifies that it was during the war, while statement 2 simply states it was during his career. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other and provide additional information about Gollob's achievements as a fighter pilot."
