  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Gordon Gollob are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he joined the Luftwaffe in 1935 and served as a reconnaissance pilot, while statement 2 says that he joined in 1936 and quickly rose through the ranks. The difference in the year of joining and the description of his initial role in the Luftwaffe creates a contradiction."
