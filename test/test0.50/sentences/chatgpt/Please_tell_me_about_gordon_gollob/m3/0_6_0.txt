  "explanation": "The statements about Gordon Gollob are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his exceptional service and achievements in the Luftwaffe. The only difference is in the wording of the reason for the award. Statement 1 simply states that he was awarded the honor, while statement 2 provides more detail by specifying that it was for his outstanding service and achievements. However, both statements are consistent in their recognition of Gollob's accomplishments."
