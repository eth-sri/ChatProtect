He is known for his love of beer, donuts, and his job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Homer is often portrayed as a lazy, clumsy, and dim-witted character, but he has a good heart and loves his family. He is also known for his catchphrase \"D'oh! \", which he says when he makes a mistake or when something goes wrong. Throughout the show's 30+ seasons, Homer has been involved in many hilarious and absurd situations, including accidentally causing a nuclear meltdown, becoming a professional wrestler, and even traveling to space.",

The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions that he is widely recognized as one of the greatest television characters of all time. However, this does not contradict statement 1 as it is still acknowledging his popularity and cultural significance."
