He is the father of the Simpson family and is known for his lazy and often clueless personality. Homer works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where he often causes accidents and mishaps due to his incompetence. Homer is known for his love of beer, donuts, and television, and often neglects his responsibilities as a husband and father. However, despite his flaws, he is a loving husband to his wife Marge and a devoted father to his three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Homer's catchphrases include \"D'oh!\" and \"Mmm... donuts,\" and he is known for his iconic bald head and yellow skin.",
