Homer is known for his love of beer, donuts, and his catchphrase \"D'oh!\" when something goes wrong. He is often portrayed as a clumsy, lazy, and somewhat dim-witted character, but he is also shown to be a devoted husband and father to his wife Marge and their three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Throughout the series, Homer has had various jobs and adventures, including becoming a professional boxer, starting his own internet company, and even traveling to space. He is also known for his friendships with his neighbor Ned Flanders and his co-worker Lenny Leonard.",
