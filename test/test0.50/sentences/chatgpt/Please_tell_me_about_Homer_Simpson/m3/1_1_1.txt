  "explanation": "The statements about Homer Simpson are not contradictory, but rather provide additional information about his first appearance on television. While statement 1 mentions his first appearance on The Simpsons in 1989 and his voice actor, statement 2 adds that he first appeared as a cartoon short on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
