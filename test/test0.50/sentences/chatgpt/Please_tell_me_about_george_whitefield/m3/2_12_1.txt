  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. While he was widely popular and influential in the Great Awakening, he also faced criticism from some members of the Anglican Church who disapproved of his preaching style and his association with the Methodist movement. This shows that Whitefield's impact was not universally accepted and that he faced opposition from some quarters."
