He was known for his powerful and emotional sermons, which attracted large crowds and inspired many people to convert to Christianity. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a minister in the Anglican Church and began preaching in London and other parts of England. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first time and began preaching in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. His sermons were widely popular and he quickly became one of the most famous preachers in America.",
