  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both emphasize his ability to deliver powerful and emotional sermons that drew large crowds of listeners and inspired many people to convert to Christianity. The only difference is in the wording of the second statement, which uses \"drew\" instead of \"attracted.\" However, both statements convey the same idea."
