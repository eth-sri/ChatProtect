  "prefix": " George Whitefield was an English Anglican cleric and evangelist who was one of the founders of the Methodist movement. He was born in 1714 in Gloucester, England and was educated at Oxford University. He became a preacher and began his ministry in England, but later traveled to America where he became a prominent figure in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept across the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was known for his powerful preaching style and his ability to attract large crowds. He preached to thousands of people at a time, often outdoors, and his sermons were filled with emotion and passion. He also used new methods of communication, such as newspapers and pamphlets, to spread his message. Whitefield was a controversial figure in his time, as he challenged many of the established religious practices and beliefs of the Anglican Church. He also advocated for the abolition of slavery and was a supporter of the American Revolution. Whitefield died in 1770 while on a preaching tour in New England.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge the impact and influence that Whitefield had on the Methodist and evangelical movements, as well as his widespread popularity and the mourning that followed his death. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions his followers and admirers, while statement 1 focuses more broadly on the continued influence of Whitefield's legacy."
