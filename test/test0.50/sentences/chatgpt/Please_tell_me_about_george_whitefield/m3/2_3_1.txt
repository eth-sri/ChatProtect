  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both state that he became a minister in the Anglican Church and began preaching in England after completing his studies and being ordained. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that he also preached in London, while statement 2 simply states that he preached in churches throughout England."
