He was born in 1714 in Gloucester, England and was educated at Oxford University. He became a preacher and began his ministry in England, but later traveled to America where he became a prominent figure in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept across the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was known for his powerful preaching style and his ability to attract large crowds. He preached to thousands of people at a time, often outdoors, and his sermons were filled with emotion and passion.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. While he was known for his powerful preaching style and ability to attract large crowds, he also used new methods of communication, such as newspapers and pamphlets, to spread his message. Additionally, he used his popularity and influence to raise funds for the Bethesda Orphanage in Georgia, which he founded in 1740. These statements provide additional information about Whitefield's methods and actions, but do not contradict the initial description of him as an Anglican cleric and evangelist who was one of the founders of the Methodist movement."
