  "prefix": " George Whitefield (1714-1770) was a prominent English Anglican cleric and evangelist who played a key role in the Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept through the British colonies in North America in the 1730s and 1740s. Whitefield was known for his powerful preaching style and his ability to draw large crowds to his sermons, which he delivered in open fields and public squares rather than in traditional church buildings. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a minister in the Church of England and began preaching in London in the early 1730s.",

Statement 1 explains that Whitefield traveled to the British colonies in North America and delivered powerful sermons that contributed to the Great Awakening, while Statement 2 highlights how his powerful sermons helped him gain a reputation as an influential preacher. Both statements are consistent with the idea that Whitefield was a prominent figure in the religious revival of the 1730s and 1740s."
