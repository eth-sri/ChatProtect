  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both emphasize his powerful preaching style and his ability to draw large crowds with his emotional sermons. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions the emotional aspect of his sermons, while statement 1 does not. However, both statements convey the same overall message about Whitefield's preaching abilities and popularity."
