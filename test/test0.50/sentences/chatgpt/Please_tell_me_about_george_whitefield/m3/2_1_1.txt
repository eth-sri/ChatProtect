Both statements emphasize his ability to draw large crowds with his powerful and emotional sermons, which were known for their intensity and delivery. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions that his sermons were held in open-air settings. Overall, both statements provide complementary information about Whitefield's preaching style and its impact on his audiences."
