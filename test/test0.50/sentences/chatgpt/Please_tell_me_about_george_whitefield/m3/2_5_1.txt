He was known for his powerful and emotional sermons, which attracted large crowds and inspired many people to convert to Christianity. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a minister in the Anglican Church and began preaching in London and other parts of England. In 1739, he traveled to America for the first time and began preaching in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. They both convey the same idea that Whitefield was a popular preacher in America during the Great Awakening. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 2 specifically mentioning the American colonies. However, both statements are consistent with the information provided in the text."
