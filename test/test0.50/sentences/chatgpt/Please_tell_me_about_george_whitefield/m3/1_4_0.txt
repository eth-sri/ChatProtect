Whitefield was known for his powerful preaching style and his ability to draw large crowds to his sermons, which he delivered in open fields and public squares rather than in traditional church buildings. Whitefield was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at Oxford University. He became a minister in the Church of England and began preaching in London in the early 1730s.",

  "explanation": "The statements about George Whitefield are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Whitefield traveled to the British colonies in North America and delivered powerful sermons that helped to spark the Great Awakening. Statement 2 provides additional information about his travels, stating that he preached to large crowds in cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, and Savannah. Both statements are consistent with Whitefield's role as a prominent evangelist during the Great Awakening and his extensive travels throughout the colonies."
