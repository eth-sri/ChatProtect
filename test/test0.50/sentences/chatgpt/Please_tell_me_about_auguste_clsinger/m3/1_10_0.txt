  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer was a French sculptor who lived from 1814 to 1883. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied under the famous sculptor Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann. Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" which he created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman who has been bitten by a snake and is dying. It is considered one of the masterpieces of French Romanticism. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits and busts, which were highly realistic and detailed. He was inspired by the works of the Italian Renaissance sculptors and often used classical motifs in his sculptures. Cl\u00e9singer was a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts and was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1861. In addition to his artistic work, Cl\u00e9singer was also involved in politics. He was a member of the Paris Commune during the Franco-Prussian War, and after the fall of the Commune, he was exiled to England for several years.",

  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Cl\u00e9singer returned to France in 1871 and continued to work as a sculptor until his death in 1883, while statement 2 says that he returned to France in 1880 and continued to create sculptures until his death in 1883. The discrepancy in the year of his return to France makes the statements contradictory."
