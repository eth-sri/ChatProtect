  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he studied under Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann, while statement 2 says that he studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. These are two different schools of study, and it is unlikely that he studied at both simultaneously. Therefore, the statements cannot both be true."
