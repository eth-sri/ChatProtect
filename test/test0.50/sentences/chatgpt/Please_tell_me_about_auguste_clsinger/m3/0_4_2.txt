  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both refer to his famous sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" but provide slightly different descriptions of the sculpture. The first statement mentions the snake biting the woman, while the second statement describes the woman writhing in pain as the snake bites her on the foot. Both statements are accurate and provide different details about the same artwork."
