  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention his depictions of mythological figures, with statement 1 also including historical and contemporary subjects. Statement 2 specifically mentions allegorical figures, which could be seen as a subset of mythological figures. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a fuller picture of Cl\u00e9singer's work."
