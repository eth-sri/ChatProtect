  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor known for his realistic and sensual depictions of the human form. He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's work was influenced by the Romantic movement and he often depicted mythological and historical figures, as well as contemporary subjects. He was particularly interested in the female form and created several sculptures of women in various poses and states of undress. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts a nude woman being bitten by a serpent. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it was seen as scandalous and erotic. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, including busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention that his work is held in prominent museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The only difference is that statement 1 also mentions that he was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, while statement 2 specifies that his work is held in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. These are simply additional pieces of information that do not contradict each other."
