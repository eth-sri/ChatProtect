He studied under the famous sculptor Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann and later became a student of Antoine-Louis Barye. Cl\u00e9singer is best known for his sculpture \"Woman bitten by a snake,\" which was created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain after being bitten by a snake, and it caused controversy when it was first exhibited due to its erotic nature. Cl\u00e9singer was also a member of the French Romantic movement and was influenced by the works of Victor Hugo and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.",
