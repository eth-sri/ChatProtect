  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer's most famous sculpture, \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" are not contradictory, but rather describe different aspects of the sculpture. Both statements convey the idea that the sculpture depicts a woman who has been bitten by a snake and is in pain. The first statement emphasizes the woman's impending death, while the second statement focuses on the physical act of the serpent biting her on the breast. Overall, the statements complement each other in providing a fuller description of the sculpture."
