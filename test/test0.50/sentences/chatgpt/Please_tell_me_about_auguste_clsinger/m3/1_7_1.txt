  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both provide information about his achievements and recognition, with the only difference being the order in which they are presented. Statement 1 mentions his membership in the French Academy of Fine Arts and his award of the Legion of Honor, while Statement 2 reverses the order of these events. However, both statements are consistent in their portrayal of Cl\u00e9singer as a highly accomplished and respected artist."
