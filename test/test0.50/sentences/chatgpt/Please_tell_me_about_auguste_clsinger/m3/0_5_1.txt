He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's work was influenced by the Romantic movement and he often depicted mythological and historical figures, as well as contemporary subjects. He was particularly interested in the female form and created several sculptures of women in various poses and states of undress. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts a nude woman being bitten by a serpent.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. They both refer to the same sculpture, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" and describe how it caused controversy and scandal when it was first exhibited in 1847 due to its erotic nature. The only difference is that statement 2 provides more specific information about where and when the sculpture was first exhibited."
