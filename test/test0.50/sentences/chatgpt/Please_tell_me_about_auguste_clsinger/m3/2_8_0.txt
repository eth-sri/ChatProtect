  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was born in Besan\u00e7on, France. He studied under the famous sculptor Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann and later became a student of Antoine-Louis Barye. Cl\u00e9singer is best known for his sculpture \"Woman bitten by a snake,\" which was created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain after being bitten by a snake, and it caused controversy when it was first exhibited due to its erotic nature. Cl\u00e9singer was also a member of the French Romantic movement and was influenced by the works of Victor Hugo and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. He created several sculptures of mythological and historical figures, including a bust of Napoleon III. In addition to his sculpture work, Cl\u00e9singer was also a painter and a writer. He wrote a book on the art of sculpture and was a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres.",

Both statements mention that Cl\u00e9singer died in Paris in 1883, but statement 1 also adds that his work can be seen in museums and galleries around the world. These statements provide complementary information about Cl\u00e9singer's life and legacy."
