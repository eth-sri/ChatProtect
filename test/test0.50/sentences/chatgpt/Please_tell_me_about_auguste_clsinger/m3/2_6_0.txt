  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was born in Besan\u00e7on, France. He studied under the famous sculptor Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann and later became a student of Antoine-Louis Barye. Cl\u00e9singer is best known for his sculpture \"Woman bitten by a snake,\" which was created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain after being bitten by a snake, and it caused controversy when it was first exhibited due to its erotic nature. Cl\u00e9singer was also a member of the French Romantic movement and was influenced by the works of Victor Hugo and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. He created several sculptures of mythological and historical figures, including a bust of Napoleon III.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Cl\u00e9singer was a painter, but they provide different information about his painting career. Statement 1 mentions that he was a writer as well, while Statement 2 mentions that his paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon. Therefore, the statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
