He was inspired by the works of the Italian Renaissance sculptors and often used classical motifs in his sculptures.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Cl\u00e9singer was a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts, but only the first statement adds that he was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1861. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about Cl\u00e9singer's achievements and affiliations."
