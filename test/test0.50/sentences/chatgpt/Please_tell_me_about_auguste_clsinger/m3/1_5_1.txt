  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. While his most famous work is a sculpture depicting a dying woman, he was also known for his realistic portraits and busts. Additionally, his works often drew inspiration from mythology and the female form, which could be seen in both his famous sculpture and his other works. Therefore, the two statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style and interests."
