  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather provide slightly different descriptions of his famous sculpture \"Woman Bitten by a Snake.\" Both statements agree that the sculpture depicts a nude woman being bitten by a snake, but the second statement adds more detail about the woman's pose and the location of the snake's bite."
