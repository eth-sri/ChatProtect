He was born in Besan\u00e7on, France, and studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Cl\u00e9singer's work was influenced by the Romantic movement and he often depicted mythological and historical figures, as well as contemporary subjects. He was particularly interested in the female form and created several sculptures of women in various poses and states of undress. One of Cl\u00e9singer's most famous works is \"Woman Bitten by a Snake,\" which depicts a nude woman being bitten by a serpent. The sculpture caused controversy when it was first exhibited in 1847, as it was seen as scandalous and erotic. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits, including busts of famous figures such as Victor Hugo and George Sand.",

Being a member of the French Legion of Honor recognizes his contributions to French culture and society. Both statements complement each other in providing a fuller picture of Cl\u00e9singer's life and career."
