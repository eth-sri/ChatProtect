Cl\u00e9singer's most famous work is the sculpture \"Woman bitten by a serpent,\" which he created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman who has been bitten by a snake and is dying. It is considered one of the masterpieces of French Romanticism. Cl\u00e9singer was also known for his portraits and busts, which were highly realistic and detailed. He was inspired by the works of the Italian Renaissance sculptors and often used classical motifs in his sculptures. Cl\u00e9singer was a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts and was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1861. In addition to his artistic work, Cl\u00e9singer was also involved in politics.",

Statement 1 says that he was exiled to England during the Franco-Prussian War, while Statement 2 says that he was exiled to Brussels during the Paris Commune. These are two different historical events that occurred at different times, so the statements cannot both be true."
