  "prefix": " Auguste Cl\u00e9singer (1814-1883) was a French sculptor who was born in Besan\u00e7on, France. He studied under the famous sculptor Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann and later became a student of Antoine-Louis Barye. Cl\u00e9singer is best known for his sculpture \"Woman bitten by a snake,\" which was created in 1847. The sculpture depicts a woman writhing in pain after being bitten by a snake, and it caused controversy when it was first exhibited due to its erotic nature. Cl\u00e9singer was also a member of the French Romantic movement and was influenced by the works of Victor Hugo and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. He created several sculptures of mythological and historical figures, including a bust of Napoleon III. In addition to his sculpture work, Cl\u00e9singer was also a painter and a writer.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that he wrote a book on the art of sculpture and was a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres, indicating that he was involved in writing and literature. The second statement mentions that a book on the art of sculpture was published posthumously in 1885, which included a chapter on Cl\u00e9singer's work, indicating that his work was recognized and included in a book about sculpture. Both statements provide additional information about Cl\u00e9singer's life and work, but they do not contradict each other."
