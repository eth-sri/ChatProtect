  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Cl\u00e9singer was influenced by the Romantic movement, but they differ in the subjects he depicted. Statement 1 mentions that he depicted a range of subjects, including mythological and historical figures, as well as contemporary subjects, while statement 2 specifically mentions the influence of Michelangelo on his work. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide different aspects of Cl\u00e9singer's artistic style and influences."
