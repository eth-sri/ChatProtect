  "explanation": "The statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are not contradictory, but rather provide different perspectives on his most famous work, \"Woman Bitten by a Snake.\" Statement 1 simply highlights the sculpture as one of Cl\u00e9singer's notable works, while statement 2 adds the additional context of the controversy surrounding the piece's erotic subject matter. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
