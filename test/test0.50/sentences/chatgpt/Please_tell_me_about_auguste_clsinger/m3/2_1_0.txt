  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer are contradictory. Statement 1 indicates that Cl\u00e9singer studied under both Klagmann and Barye, while statement 2 suggests that he only studied under Klagmann. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
