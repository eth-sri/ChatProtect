  "explanation": "No, the statements are not contradictory. Both statements provide the same information about Auguste Cl\u00e9singer being a French sculptor born in Besan\u00e7on, France. The only difference is the structure of the sentence. Statement 1 provides the birth and death years of Cl\u00e9singer, while Statement 2 omits this information. However, both statements convey the same basic information about Cl\u00e9singer's profession and place of birth."
