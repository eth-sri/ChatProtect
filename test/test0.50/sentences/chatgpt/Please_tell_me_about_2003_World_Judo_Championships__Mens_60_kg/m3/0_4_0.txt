  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory because they provide different information about who won the bronze medals. Statement 1 states that Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Limardo of Venezuela and Khashbaataryn Tsagaanbaatar of Mongolia won the bronze medals, while statement 2 states that Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba and Hiroshi Izumi of Japan won the bronze medals. Therefore, only one of the statements can be correct."
