  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. While statement 1 mentions that Japan won a total of 10 medals, including 5 golds, it does not specify which weight categories these medals were won in. Statement 2 clarifies that Japan won four gold medals out of the seven weight categories, indicating that they were dominant across the tournament as a whole. Therefore, both statements provide complementary information about Japan's performance at the championships."
