  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 says that Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Limardo of Venezuela defeated Hiroaki Hiraoka of Japan in the bronze medal match, while Khashbaataryn Tsagaanbaatar of Mongolia defeated Yordanis Arencibia of Cuba. However, statement 2 says that Limardo defeated Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Demontfaucon of France to win the bronze medal. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about who Limardo defeated to win the bronze medal."
