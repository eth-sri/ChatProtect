While the first statement talks about Hiroshi Izumi's success in later competitions such as the 2012 Olympics and the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games, the second statement mentions his achievement immediately after the 2003 World Judo Championships, which was winning a bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Both statements provide additional information about Izumi's career after his win at the 2003 World Judo Championships."
