They both state that Tadahiro Nomura won his third consecutive gold medal in the men's 60 kg weight category at the 2003 World Judo Championships. The only difference is in the order and wording of the information. Statement 1 emphasizes that Nomura had previously won gold in 2001 and 2002, while Statement 2 emphasizes that the 2003 victory marked his third consecutive gold medal."
