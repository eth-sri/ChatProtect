  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the bronze medals were won by Ludwig Paischer of Austria and Yury Rybak of Belarus, while Statement 2 mentions that the bronze medals were won by Georgii Zantaraia of Ukraine and Ludwig Paischer of Austria. These two statements have different athletes winning the bronze medal, which contradicts each other."
