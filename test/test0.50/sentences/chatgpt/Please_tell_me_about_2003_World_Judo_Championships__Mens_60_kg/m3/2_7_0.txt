  "explanation": "The statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships Men's 60 kg are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that both judokas earned a yuko each, indicating a tie or draw. However, statement 2 states that the match was decided by a single yuko score in favor of Paischer, implying that he won the match. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
