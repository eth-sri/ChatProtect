  "explanation": "The two statements about the 2003 World Judo Championships - Men's 60 kg are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same information that Hiroshi Izumi became the youngest male judoka to win a gold medal in the Men's 60 kg category at the World Judo Championships. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes that he was the youngest ever to win a world championship title, while statement 2 specifies that he was the youngest ever to win a gold medal in the Men's 60 kg category."
