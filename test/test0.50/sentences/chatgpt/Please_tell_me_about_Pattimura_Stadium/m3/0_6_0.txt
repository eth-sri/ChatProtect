Both statements mention that the stadium hosts events other than football matches, such as concerts and cultural festivals. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions sporting events, while statement 2 mentions music concerts. However, both statements support the idea that Pattimura Stadium is a multi-purpose venue that can accommodate various types of events."
