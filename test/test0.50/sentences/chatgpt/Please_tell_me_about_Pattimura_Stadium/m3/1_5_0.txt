  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the stadium has hosted various events such as music concerts and cultural festivals, in addition to football matches. The only difference is that statement 1 lists religious gatherings as one of the events hosted at the stadium, while statement 2 does not mention them. However, this does not create a contradiction between the two statements."
