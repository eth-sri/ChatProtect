Statement 1 specifies that Persipura Jayapura, a professional football club from outside Maluku Province, uses the stadium as their home ground. Statement 2 simply states that professional football clubs from Maluku Province also play their home matches at the stadium. Both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other."
