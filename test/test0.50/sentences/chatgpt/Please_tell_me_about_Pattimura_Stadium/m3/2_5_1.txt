  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the stadium has hosted events other than football matches, such as music concerts and cultural festivals. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions cultural events and concerts, while statement 1 provides a broader range of examples. However, both statements support the idea that the stadium is used for more than just football matches."
