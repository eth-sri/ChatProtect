  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Pattimura Stadium are contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that the stadium is the home stadium of Persiram Raja Ampat, a professional football club that competes in the Liga 3, while statement 2 mentions that the same club plays in the Liga 2, which is a higher tier of Indonesian football. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
