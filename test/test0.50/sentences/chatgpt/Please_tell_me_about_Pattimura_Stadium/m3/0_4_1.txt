  "explanation": "The statements about Pattimura Stadium are not contradictory. Both statements mention the renovation of the stadium in 2012, but they provide different details about the renovation. Statement 1 mentions that the renovation was done to meet FIFA standards, while Statement 2 provides more specific details about the upgrades, such as the installation of a new artificial turf playing surface and upgraded seating areas. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of the stadium's history and features."
