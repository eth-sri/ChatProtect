  "explanation": "The statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his achievements during his tenure as president of the National University of Singapore, with a focus on his role in expanding and modernizing the university's research capabilities and establishing new research institutes and collaborations with international institutions. The only difference between the two statements is the specific emphasis on the nature of the research institutes established - one statement mentions interdisciplinary research institutes, while the other does not. However, this difference does not contradict the overall message that Tan played a significant role in advancing the university's research agenda."
