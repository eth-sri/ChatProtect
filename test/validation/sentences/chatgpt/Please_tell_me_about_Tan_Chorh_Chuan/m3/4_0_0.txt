  "explanation": "The statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are not contradictory. Statement 1 mentions that he joined the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in 1997 and served as a professor of medicine and later as the dean of the school from 2000 to 2008. Statement 2 mentions that he joined the National University of Singapore (NUS) as a faculty member in 1985, which could refer to his initial appointment at the university before he joined the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in 1997. Therefore, both statements provide different information about his career at NUS and do not contradict each other."
