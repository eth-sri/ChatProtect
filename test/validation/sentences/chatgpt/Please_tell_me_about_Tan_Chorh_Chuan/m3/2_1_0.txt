  "explanation": "The statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he completed his residency in internal medicine and nephrology at the Singapore General Hospital. The only difference is that statement 1 mentions that he was awarded a PhD in renal physiology from the University of London in 1992, while statement 2 mentions that he was awarded a scholarship to pursue further studies in the United States. These are not contradictory as it is possible for someone to receive a scholarship to pursue further studies after completing their residency and also to obtain a PhD in a related field."
