  "explanation": "The statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are not contradictory. While statement 1 mentions that he holds a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of London, statement 2 specifies that he holds a PhD in Physiology from the same university, which he obtained in 1993. It is possible for an individual to hold multiple degrees from the same or different universities, and in this case, Tan Chorh Chuan holds both a Doctor of Medicine degree and a PhD in Physiology from the University of London."
