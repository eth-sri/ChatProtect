  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he graduated with an MBBS degree in 1985, while statement 2 says that he graduated with the same degree in 1981. Since the two statements provide different years of graduation, they cannot both be true."
