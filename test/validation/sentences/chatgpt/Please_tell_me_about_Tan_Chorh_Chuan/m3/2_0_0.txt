  "explanation": "The statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are contradictory. The first statement states that he was born in 1960 and graduated from NUS with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree in 1985, while the second statement states that he graduated from the University of Singapore with the same degree in 1960. Since he cannot have graduated from two different universities with the same degree in the same year, the statements cannot both be true."
