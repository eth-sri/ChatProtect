  "explanation": "The statements about Tan Chorh Chuan are not contradictory. Both statements credit him with transforming the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine into a leading medical institution in Asia. The only difference is in the choice of words - \"one of the leading medical schools\" versus \"a leading medical institution\". Both convey the same idea that Tan Chorh Chuan played a significant role in elevating the status of the school."
