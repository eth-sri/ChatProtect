  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not necessarily contradictory, but they do present different aspects of his writing. Statement 1 highlights Bulgakov's use of fantasy and satire to explore the struggles of individuals in a repressive society, while statement 2 emphasizes his focus on the supernatural and absurd, which may have been influenced by his experiences as a doctor during the Russian Revolution. Both statements offer valid insights into Bulgakov's work, but they do not necessarily contradict each other."
