  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 states that \"The Master and Margarita\" was written between 1928 and 1940 but was not published until 1966, after his death. \n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, states that Bulgakov published his most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita,\" in 1967. \n\nSince Statement 1 indicates that the book was not published until after Bulgakov's death, while Statement 2 suggests that he published it himself, the two statements cannot both be true."
