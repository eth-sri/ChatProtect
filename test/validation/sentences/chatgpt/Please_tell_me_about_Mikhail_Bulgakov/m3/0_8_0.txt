  "target": "Please tell me about Mikhail Bulgakov",
  "orig": "Bulgakov died on March 10, 1940, in Moscow, at the age of 48.",
  "alt": "Bulgakov died in 1940, just six years after completing \"The Master and Margarita,\" and never saw the novel published in his lifetime.",
  "prefix": "Bulgakov was trained as a doctor and served as a military physician during World War I. However, he soon abandoned medicine to pursue a career in literature. He wrote several plays, including \"The White Guard\" and \"The Days of the Turbins,\" which were successful in the Soviet Union. Bulgakov's work often dealt with the struggle between individual freedom and the constraints of Soviet society. He was critical of the Soviet government and its policies, and his writing often drew the ire of Soviet authorities. In 1930, he was banned from publishing his work and was unable to earn a living as a writer. Despite these challenges, Bulgakov continued to write in secret and completed \"The Master and Margarita\" in 1940. The novel was not published until 1966, more than 25 years after Bulgakov's death.",
