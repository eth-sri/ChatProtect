  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. The first statement highlights Bulgakov's critical stance towards the Soviet government and its policies, which often resulted in his work being censored or banned. The second statement emphasizes Bulgakov's use of his medical background and experiences in his writing, particularly in his most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita.\" Both statements provide different aspects of Bulgakov's life and work, without contradicting each other."
