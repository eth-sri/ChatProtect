  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Bulgakov was trained as a doctor and served as a physician during World War I. The only difference is that statement 2 is more specific in mentioning that Bulgakov served as a doctor during the war. However, this does not contradict statement 1 as it still acknowledges Bulgakov's medical training and service during the same time period."
