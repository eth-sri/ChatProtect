  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory, but rather present two different phases of his life. Statement 1 refers to his early career as a military physician during World War I, while statement 2 refers to his later transition to writing after working as a physician for several years. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
