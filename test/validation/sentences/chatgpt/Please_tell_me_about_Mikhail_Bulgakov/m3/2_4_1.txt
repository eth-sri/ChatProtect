  "alt": "His works were often censored by the Soviet government due to their critical portrayal of Soviet society, and Bulgakov himself faced persecution and censorship throughout his career.",
  "prefix": "Bulgakov's most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita,\" was written between 1928 and 1940, but was not published until 1966, after his death. The novel is a complex satire that combines elements of fantasy, romance, and political commentary. It tells the story of the devil's visit to Moscow in the 1930s, and his interactions with a writer known as the Master and his lover, Margarita. Bulgakov's other notable works include the plays \"The White Guard\" and \"Heart of a Dog,\" as well as the novel \"The Fatal Eggs.\"",

  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements mention his works being banned or censored by the Soviet government and his persecution throughout his career. The only difference is that statement 1 focuses on his success as a writer despite the persecution, while statement 2 emphasizes the critical portrayal of Soviet society in his works as the reason for censorship."
