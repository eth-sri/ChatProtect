  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements convey the same idea that Bulgakov left his medical career to pursue writing. The only difference is in the placement of the word \"soon\" in statement 1, which implies a quicker transition from medicine to literature. However, this does not contradict the overall message of both statements."
