  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Bulgakov faced censorship and persecution from the Soviet government, which resulted in his work being revised or banned. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions his plays being banned from production, while statement 2 mentions his plays and novels being banned from publication. However, both statements convey the same overall message about the challenges Bulgakov faced as a writer in a repressive society."
