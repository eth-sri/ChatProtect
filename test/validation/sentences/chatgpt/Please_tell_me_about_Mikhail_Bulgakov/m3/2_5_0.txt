  "prefix": "Bulgakov's most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita,\" was written between 1928 and 1940, but was not published until 1966, after his death. The novel is a complex satire that combines elements of fantasy, romance, and political commentary. It tells the story of the devil's visit to Moscow in the 1930s, and his interactions with a writer known as the Master and his lover, Margarita. Bulgakov's other notable works include the plays \"The White Guard\" and \"Heart of a Dog,\" as well as the novel \"The Fatal Eggs.\" Despite his success as a writer, Bulgakov was often persecuted by the Soviet government, and his works were frequently banned or censored.",
