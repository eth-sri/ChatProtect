  "prefix": "Bulgakov was trained as a doctor and served as a military physician during World War I. However, he soon abandoned medicine to pursue a career in literature. He wrote several plays, including \"The White Guard\" and \"The Days of the Turbins,\" which were successful in the Soviet Union. Bulgakov's work often dealt with the struggle between individual freedom and the constraints of Soviet society. He was critical of the Soviet government and its policies, and his writing often drew the ire of Soviet authorities. In 1930, he was banned from publishing his work and was unable to earn a living as a writer.",

Statement 1 explains that Bulgakov continued to write in secret despite being banned from publishing his work, and completed his most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita,\" in 1940. Statement 2 adds that although he completed the work in 1940, it was not published until 1966, more than 25 years after his death. Both statements provide additional information about Bulgakov's life and work, but do not contradict each other."
