  "orig": "In 1930, he was banned from publishing his work and was unable to earn a living as a writer.",
  "alt": "He was banned from publishing his most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita,\" during his lifetime due to its criticism of the Soviet government and censorship.",
  "prefix": "Bulgakov was trained as a doctor and served as a military physician during World War I. However, he soon abandoned medicine to pursue a career in literature. He wrote several plays, including \"The White Guard\" and \"The Days of the Turbins,\" which were successful in the Soviet Union. Bulgakov's work often dealt with the struggle between individual freedom and the constraints of Soviet society. He was critical of the Soviet government and its policies, and his writing often drew the ire of Soviet authorities.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the censorship and suppression of Bulgakov's work by the Soviet government due to his critical views and commentary on Soviet society. The first statement mentions his ban from publishing, while the second statement specifically refers to the ban on his most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita.\" Both statements support the idea that Bulgakov faced significant obstacles in expressing his ideas and opinions through his writing."
