  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. The first statement highlights Bulgakov's criticism of the Soviet government and its policies, which often resulted in his work being censored or banned. The second statement mentions his most famous work, \"The Master and Margarita,\" which was not published until after his death and is known for its satirical portrayal of Soviet society. Both statements emphasize Bulgakov's opposition to the constraints of Soviet society and his willingness to challenge the government through his writing."
