  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements describe \"The Master and Margarita\" as a satirical work that combines elements of fantasy and political commentary. The only difference is that statement 2 adds the element of religious allegory to the mix. However, this does not contradict statement 1, as religious allegory can be seen as a subset of fantasy. Therefore, both statements can be true at the same time."
