  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements describe \"The Master and Margarita\" as a complex satire that combines various elements such as fantasy, romance, political commentary, religious commentary, social commentary, and magical realism. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically mentions the inclusion of religious commentary and magical realism, while statement 1 mentions romance instead. However, this difference does not make the statements contradictory."
