  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory, but rather complementary. Both statements highlight the theme of struggle in Bulgakov's work, with the first statement emphasizing the conflict between individual freedom and societal constraints, and the second statement emphasizing the struggle of the individual against the oppressive Soviet system. These themes are often intertwined in Bulgakov's writing, as he explores the complexities of life under Soviet rule."
