  "prefix": "Bulgakov was trained as a doctor and served as a military physician during World War I. However, he soon abandoned medicine to pursue a career in literature. He wrote several plays, including \"The White Guard\" and \"The Days of the Turbins,\" which were successful in the Soviet Union. Bulgakov's work often dealt with the struggle between individual freedom and the constraints of Soviet society. He was critical of the Soviet government and its policies, and his writing often drew the ire of Soviet authorities. In 1930, he was banned from publishing his work and was unable to earn a living as a writer.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Bulgakov continued to write in secret despite the ban on his work, and that \"The Master and Margarita\" was completed and not published until after his death. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that the novel was completed in 1940, while statement 2 simply states that it was his most famous novel and not published until after his death."
