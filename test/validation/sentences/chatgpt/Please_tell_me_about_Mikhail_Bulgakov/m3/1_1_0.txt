Both statements focus on Bulgakov's most famous novel, \"The Master and Margarita,\" and highlight its complex and satirical nature. The first statement emphasizes the blending of various elements in the novel, while the second statement focuses on its exploration of good and evil in Soviet society. However, both statements ultimately convey the same message about Bulgakov's use of satire and fantasy to critique repressive societies."
