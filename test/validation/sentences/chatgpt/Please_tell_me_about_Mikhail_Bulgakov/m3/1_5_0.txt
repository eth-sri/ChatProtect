  "alt": "He is considered one of the greatest Russian writers of the 20th century, and his works continue to be celebrated and studied around the world.",
  "prefix": "Bulgakov's writing often dealt with the struggles of individuals in a repressive society, and he frequently used elements of fantasy and satire in his work. \"The Master and Margarita,\" his most famous novel, is a complex and surreal tale that blends elements of Christianity, mythology, and political satire. Despite his success, Bulgakov faced constant censorship and persecution from the Soviet government. He was often forced to revise his work to appease government officials, and many of his plays were banned from production. Bulgakov died in 1940 at the age of 48, and much of his work was not published in its original form until after his death.",

Both statements acknowledge his status as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and the continued admiration and study of his works around the world. The only difference is that statement 2 specifically highlights his Russian heritage, while statement 1 does not."
