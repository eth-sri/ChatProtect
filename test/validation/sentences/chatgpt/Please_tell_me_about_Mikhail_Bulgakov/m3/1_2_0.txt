  "explanation": "The statements about Mikhail Bulgakov are not contradictory. Both statements highlight the fact that Bulgakov faced censorship and persecution from the Soviet government due to his critical portrayal of Soviet society in his writing. The first statement emphasizes that despite his success, he faced constant censorship and persecution, while the second statement emphasizes that he faced significant censorship and persecution during his lifetime. Both statements support the idea that Bulgakov's work was not well-received by the Soviet government and that he faced significant challenges as a result."
