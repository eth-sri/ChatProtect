  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his role as an early Portuguese explorer who contributed to the expansion of the Portuguese empire during the Age of Discovery. The second statement specifically mentions his involvement in establishing Portugal's presence in the Indian Ocean, which is a significant part of the Portuguese empire's expansion. Therefore, both statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Sequeira's contributions."
