  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Both statements mention his voyages to India and the East Indies, where he established relations with local rulers and traded for valuable commodities. The only difference is that statement 1 emphasizes his exploration of new territories, while statement 2 emphasizes his diplomatic relations. However, both statements are consistent with Sequeira's role as a captain of a ship and his mission to establish trade and diplomatic relations with foreign powers."
