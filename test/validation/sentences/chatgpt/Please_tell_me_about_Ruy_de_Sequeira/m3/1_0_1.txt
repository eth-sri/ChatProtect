The first statement describes his early career as a soldier and his appointment as a ship captain by King Manuel I of Portugal. The second statement highlights a significant moment in his diplomatic career when he was appointed as the first Portuguese ambassador to Ethiopia in 1520. These statements provide different pieces of information about Sequeira's career, but they do not contradict each other."
