The first statement specifically mentions the Battle of Diu as a key event that secured Portuguese control, while the second statement emphasizes Sequeira's efforts in establishing trade relations and strengthening the Portuguese presence in the region as a whole. Both statements complement each other in providing a comprehensive understanding of Sequeira's contributions to Portuguese expansion in the Indian Ocean."
