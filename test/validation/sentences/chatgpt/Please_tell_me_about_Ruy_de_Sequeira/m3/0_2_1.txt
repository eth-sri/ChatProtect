Both statements describe Sequeira's exploration and contact with local rulers and traders in the region surrounding Malacca. The first statement specifically mentions his exploration of Sumatra and Java, while the second statement mentions his contact with the Sultan of Johor and the King of Siam. However, both statements are consistent in describing Sequeira's activities in the region."
