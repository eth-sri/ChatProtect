Both statements highlight his voyages to India and the East Indies, where he established trade relations and explored new territories. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes his skills as a navigator and explorer, while statement 1 focuses on his accomplishments in establishing trade relations. However, both statements are consistent with Sequeira's career as a captain and explorer."
