  "explanation": "Yes, the statements about Ruy de Sequeira are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was replaced by Afonso de Albuquerque as the governor of Portuguese India in 1510 but continued to serve as a navigator and explorer. However, statement 2 says that he served as the governor of Portuguese India until 1512 when he was succeeded by Afonso de Albuquerque. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
