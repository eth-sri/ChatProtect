  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are contradictory. Statement 1 states that Sequeira was appointed as the governor of Portuguese India in 1508 and held the position until 1509, while statement 2 states that he was appointed as the governor in 1522, succeeding Diogo Lopes de Sequeira. These two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different dates for Sequeira's appointment as governor."
