Sequeira also explored the nearby islands of Sumatra and Java, and made contact with local rulers and traders. In 1510, Sequeira was replaced by Afonso de Albuquerque as the governor of Portuguese India, but he continued to serve as a navigator and explorer. He participated in the conquest of Goa in 1510 and the capture of the island of Socotra in 1507.",
