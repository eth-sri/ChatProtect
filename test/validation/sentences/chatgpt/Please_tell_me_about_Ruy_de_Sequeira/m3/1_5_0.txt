  "prefix": "Sequeira began his career as a soldier and was later appointed as the captain of a ship by King Manuel I of Portugal. He made several voyages to India and the East Indies, where he established trade relations with local rulers and explored new territories. In 1508, Sequeira was appointed as the governor of Portuguese India, a position he held until 1509. During his tenure, he established the first Portuguese factory in Calicut and strengthened the Portuguese presence in the region. Sequeira also played a key role in the Battle of Diu in 1509, where the Portuguese defeated a joint fleet of Ottoman and Egyptian forces.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge the significance of Sequeira's role in the Battle of Diu and how it contributed to Portuguese dominance in the Indian Ocean region. The only difference is in the wording, with the first statement emphasizing the control over trade routes and the second statement emphasizing the expansion of their empire. However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea that the Battle of Diu was a crucial moment in Portuguese history and Sequeira played a key role in it."
