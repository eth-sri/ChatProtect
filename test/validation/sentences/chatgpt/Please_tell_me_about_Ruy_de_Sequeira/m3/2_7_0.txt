  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Both statements highlight his role in expanding the Portuguese empire and establishing their dominance in the Indian Ocean through his expeditions and military campaigns. The only difference is in the specific wording used to describe the outcome of his actions, with one statement mentioning \"key trade routes\" and the other mentioning \"dominance.\" However, both statements ultimately convey the same idea."
