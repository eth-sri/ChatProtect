Both statements mention that he established trade relations with local rulers and explored new territories during his voyages. The only difference is that statement 1 specifies that he made several voyages to India and the East Indies, while statement 2 does not mention the specific locations of his voyages. However, this does not contradict the information provided in statement 1."
