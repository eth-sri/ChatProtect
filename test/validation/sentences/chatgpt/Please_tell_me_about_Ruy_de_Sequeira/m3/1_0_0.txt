  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Both statements mention the beginning of his career, with one specifying that he started as a soldier and later became a ship captain appointed by King Manuel I, while the other states that he began as a Portuguese explorer in the early 16th century. These statements can be seen as complementary, with the second statement providing more detail about the specific type of work Sequeira was involved in as an explorer."
