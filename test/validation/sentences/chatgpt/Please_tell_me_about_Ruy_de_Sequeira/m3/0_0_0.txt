  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Statement 1 specifies a particular mission that Sequeira was sent on in 1509, while statement 2 provides a broader description of his exploratory activities in the Indian Ocean during the early 16th century. It is possible that Sequeira's mission to establish trade relations with the Sultan of Malacca was part of his larger exploratory efforts in the region. Therefore, the two statements do not contradict each other."
