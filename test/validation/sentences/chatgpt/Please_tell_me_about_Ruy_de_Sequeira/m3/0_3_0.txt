  "explanation": "The statements about Ruy de Sequeira are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Sequeira was replaced as the governor of Portuguese India in 1510, but he continued to serve as a navigator and explorer. Statement 2 explains that Sequeira was replaced in his specific mission to establish trade relations with the Sultan of Malacca by Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1511, who was sent to reinforce the Portuguese presence in Malacca. These statements do not contradict each other as they refer to different aspects of Sequeira's career and missions."
