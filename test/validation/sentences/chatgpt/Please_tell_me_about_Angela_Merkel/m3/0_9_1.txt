She has been awarded numerous honors for her leadership, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2011.

  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge her legacy as a strong and influential leader in Germany and Europe, and suggest that her impact will continue even after she leaves office. The only difference is in the wording, with statement 2 emphasizing that Merkel has left an indelible mark on German politics and the European Union. Overall, both statements are complimentary and highlight Merkel's significant contributions to politics and leadership."
