  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. Both statements mention her involvement in the pro-democracy movement in East Germany and her subsequent joining of the CDU after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The only difference is that statement 1 provides more specific timing information about her involvement in the movement, while statement 2 focuses on her joining of the CDU. However, both statements are consistent with each other and with the overall narrative of Merkel's life and career."
