  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. They both mention that she has been awarded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2011. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that she has received awards throughout her career, while statement 1 does not. However, this does not create a contradiction between the two statements."
