  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. They both highlight different aspects of her political career and beliefs. While statement 1 focuses on her stance on human rights and criticism of the Russian government, statement 2 highlights her advocacy for climate change action and Germany's transition to renewable energy sources. These two statements do not conflict with each other and can coexist as part of Merkel's overall political profile."
