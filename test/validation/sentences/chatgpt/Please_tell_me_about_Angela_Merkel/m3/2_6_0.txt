After Kohl's defeat in the 1998 elections, Merkel became the CDU's Secretary-General and later became the leader of the party in 2000. She was elected as the Chancellor of Germany in 2005, becoming the first woman to hold the position. During her time as Chancellor, Merkel played a key role in shaping the European Union's response to the 2008 financial crisis, the refugee crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. She has been known for her pragmatic and cautious approach to politics, often referred to as \"Merkelism.\"",

Both statements mention that Merkel announced in 2018 that she would not seek re-election as Chancellor in the 2021 elections. The only difference is that statement 2 adds more context by highlighting Merkel's status as one of the most powerful leaders in the world and the significance of her decision in marking the end of an era in German politics."
