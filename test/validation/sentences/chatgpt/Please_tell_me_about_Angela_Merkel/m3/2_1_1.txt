  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. They both mention that she joined the CDU party in 1990 and was appointed as a minister in the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1991. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that she was appointed as the Federal Minister for Women and Youth, while statement 1 does not mention the word \"federal\". However, this difference in wording does not change the overall meaning of the statements."
