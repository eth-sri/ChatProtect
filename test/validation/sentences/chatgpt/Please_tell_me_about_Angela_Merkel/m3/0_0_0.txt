  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Merkel joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in 1990, which is a fact. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about the context of her joining the party, which is after the reunification of Germany. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory but rather complementary."
