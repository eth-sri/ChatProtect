  "explanation": "The two statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. They both provide information about her political career, specifically her early involvement in the Christian Democratic Union party and her appointment as Minister for Women and Youth in Helmut Kohl's government. The only difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the word \"Chancellor\" before Helmut Kohl in the first statement, which is not present in the second statement. However, this does not change the overall meaning or accuracy of the statements."
