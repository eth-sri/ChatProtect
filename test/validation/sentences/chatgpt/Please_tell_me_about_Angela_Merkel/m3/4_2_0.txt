  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. Both statements describe her leadership style as pragmatic and cautious, with a focus on navigating complex political situations and maintaining stability. The only difference is that statement 2 emphasizes her focus on consensus-building, while statement 1 does not mention it explicitly. However, this does not contradict the overall characterization of Merkel's leadership style in either statement."
