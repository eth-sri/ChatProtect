In 2000, she was elected as the CDU's Secretary-General, and in 2005, she was elected as the Chancellor of Germany, succeeding Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. During her time as Chancellor, Merkel has been known for her pragmatic and cautious approach to politics. She has played a key role in managing the European debt crisis and has been a strong advocate for European integration. Merkel has also been a vocal supporter of human rights, and she has been critical of the Russian government's actions in Ukraine. In 2015, Merkel faced criticism for her decision to allow over a million refugees to enter Germany. The move was seen as controversial, with some arguing that it would lead to social and economic problems in the country. However, Merkel defended her decision, saying that it was a moral imperative to help those in need. In 2018, Merkel announced that she would not seek re-election as Chancellor in 2021. She was succeeded by Armin Laschet as the leader of the CDU.",
