Statement 1 provides information about Merkel's early political career, including her appointments as Minister for Women and Youth and Minister for the Environment. Statement 2 highlights her historic achievement as the first female chancellor of Germany, which occurred many years later in 2005. These statements provide complementary information about Merkel's career trajectory and do not contradict each other."
