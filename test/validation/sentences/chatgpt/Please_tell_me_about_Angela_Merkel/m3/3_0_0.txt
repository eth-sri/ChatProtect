Statement 1 provides information about Merkel's earlier political career, including her appointments as Minister for Women and Youth and Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety. Statement 2 highlights her historic appointment as the first female chancellor of Germany in 2005. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide different pieces of information about Merkel's political career."
