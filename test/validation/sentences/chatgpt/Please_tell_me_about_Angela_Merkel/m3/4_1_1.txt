  "explanation": "The statements about Angela Merkel are not contradictory. Both statements highlight her advocacy for environmental policies and the transition to renewable energy sources. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions her support for climate change action, while statement 2 mentions her support for environmental policies in general. However, both statements ultimately convey the same message about Merkel's commitment to promoting sustainable energy practices."
