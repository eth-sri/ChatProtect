  "target": "Please tell me about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo",
  "orig": "He continued to be active in Bolivian politics and served as a senator until his death in 1996.",
  "alt": "He continued to be active in Bolivian politics even after resigning from office, and remained a prominent figure in the country until his death in 1992.",
  "prefix": "Siles was first elected as President in 1956, but his term was cut short by a military coup in 1964. He went into exile in Chile and later in Peru, where he continued to advocate for democracy and social justice in Bolivia. In 1982, Siles was elected President again, this time in a democratic election. He implemented economic and social reforms aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, but his government faced challenges from inflation, political instability, and opposition from conservative forces. Siles resigned from office in 1985, citing health reasons, and was succeeded by his Vice President, V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he served as a senator until his death in 1996, while statement 2 says that he remained a prominent figure in the country until his death in 1992. Since the year of his death is different in each statement, they cannot both be true."
