He was elected President of Bolivia in 1956, but his government was overthrown in a military coup in 1964. Siles Zuazo went into exile in Peru and later in France, where he continued to work for the restoration of democracy in Bolivia. He returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again, serving from 1982 to 1985. During his second presidency, he implemented economic reforms and social programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality. Siles Zuazo was elected President for a third time in 1985, but his government was again overthrown in a military coup in 1989.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory. Statement 1 suggests that he retired from politics and lived in France until his death in 1996, while statement 2 suggests that he retired from politics after the 1989 coup and spent the rest of his life advocating for democracy and social justice in Bolivia. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
