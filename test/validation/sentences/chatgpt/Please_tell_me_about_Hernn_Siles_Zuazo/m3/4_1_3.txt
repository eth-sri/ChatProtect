  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Siles Zuazo's presidency was marked by economic crisis and political turmoil, which led to his resignation in 1985. Statement 2 adds that during his presidency, economic reforms were implemented. These two statements do not contradict each other, as it is possible for a president to face economic crisis and political turmoil while also implementing economic reforms. In fact, it is often during times of crisis that reforms are implemented in an attempt to stabilize the situation. Therefore, the two statements provide complementary information about Siles Zuazo's presidency."
