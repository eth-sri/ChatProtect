  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention that his term as President was cut short, with statement 1 providing the specific year of the military coup and statement 2 simply stating that it was due to a military coup. Therefore, both statements are consistent with each other."
