  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he became president of Bolivia in 1956, but they differ in the reason for his rise to power. The first statement states that he became president following a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship, while the second statement states that he became president after leading a successful revolution against the military government. Both statements are consistent with the fact that Siles Zuazo was a member of the left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party, which played a key role in Bolivian politics in the mid-20th century."
