  "prefix": "Siles Zuazo was a member of the left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party, which played a key role in Bolivian politics in the mid-20th century. He first became president in 1956, following a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship. During his presidency, he pursued a series of ambitious social and economic reforms, including agrarian reform, nationalization of mines, and the establishment of a national health care system. However, Siles Zuazo's first presidency was also marked by political instability and violence, as he faced opposition from conservative and military factions. He was forced to flee the country in 1964, following a military coup. Siles Zuazo returned to Bolivia in 1982, following the downfall of another military dictatorship.",

Both statements mention that he served as president of Bolivia from 1982 to 1985, after his return to the country. The only difference is that statement 2 provides additional information about his advocacy for progressive policies and social justice during his second presidency."
