  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was elected as the President of Bolivia in 1956, but the first statement adds that his government was overthrown in a military coup in 1964. The second statement does not mention the coup, but it does mention that he was the first MNR candidate to win the presidency. Therefore, both statements provide different pieces of information about Siles Zuazo's presidency, but they do not contradict each other."
