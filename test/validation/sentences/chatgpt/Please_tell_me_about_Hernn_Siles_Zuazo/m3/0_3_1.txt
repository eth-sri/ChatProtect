  "orig": "He returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again in 1982, serving until 1985.",
  "alt": "He was elected as President of Bolivia for a second time in 1982, following a period of military rule, and served until 1985.",
  "prefix": "Siles Zuazo was a member of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party and played a significant role in the Bolivian political scene during the mid-20th century. He first served as the President of Bolivia from 1956 to 1960, during which he implemented several progressive reforms, including land reform and the nationalization of Bolivia's tin mines. After a military coup ousted him from power in 1960, Siles Zuazo went into exile in Chile and later in Peru.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was elected as President of Bolivia for a second time in 1982 and served until 1985. The only difference is that statement 1 provides additional information about his return to Bolivia in 1979 before being elected as President again, while statement 2 mentions that he was elected following a period of military rule. However, both statements are consistent in their main point about Siles Zuazo's second presidency."
