He first served as the President of Bolivia from 1956 to 1960, during which he implemented several progressive reforms, including land reform and the nationalization of Bolivia's tin mines. After a military coup ousted him from power in 1960, Siles Zuazo went into exile in Chile and later in Peru. He returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again in 1982, serving until 1985. During his second term, Siles Zuazo faced several challenges, including a severe economic crisis and social unrest.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements refer to his second term as President, during which he faced economic challenges and attempted to implement austerity measures to address them. The first statement notes that these efforts were met with protests and strikes, while the second statement simply states that Siles Zuazo sought to implement austerity measures. Therefore, the statements are complementary and provide additional information about Siles Zuazo's presidency."
