  "alt": "He was forced to resign in 1964, after a military coup led by General Ren\u00e9 Barrientos overthrew his government.",
  "prefix": "Siles Zuazo was a member of the left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party, which played a key role in Bolivian politics in the mid-20th century. He first became president in 1956, following a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship. During his presidency, he pursued a series of ambitious social and economic reforms, including agrarian reform, nationalization of mines, and the establishment of a national health care system. However, Siles Zuazo's first presidency was also marked by political instability and violence, as he faced opposition from conservative and military factions.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention a military coup in 1964 that led to his departure from the presidency. The only difference is in the wording - statement 1 says he was forced to flee the country, while statement 2 says he was forced to resign. However, both statements convey the same idea that Siles Zuazo's presidency was cut short by a military coup in 1964."
