  "prefix": "In 1956, Siles Zuazo became the leader of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), which was a left-leaning political party that sought to modernize Bolivia and promote social justice. He was elected President of Bolivia in 1956, but his government was overthrown in a military coup in 1964. Siles Zuazo went into exile in Peru and later in France, where he continued to work for the restoration of democracy in Bolivia. He returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again, serving from 1982 to 1985. During his second presidency, he implemented economic reforms and social programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality. Siles Zuazo was elected President for a third time in 1985, but his government was again overthrown in a military coup in 1989.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. The first statement is true, as Siles Zuazo did live in France until his death in 1996. However, the second statement is also true, as Siles Zuazo dedicated his life to promoting democracy and social justice in Bolivia, even while living in exile. The fact that he returned to Bolivia and was elected President twice further supports this statement. Therefore, both statements can coexist without contradiction."
