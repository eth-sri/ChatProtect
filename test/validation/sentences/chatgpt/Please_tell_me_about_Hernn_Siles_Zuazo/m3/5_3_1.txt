  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. The second statement mentions that he was elected President of Bolivia in 1956, which is true. The first statement mentions that he was elected President once again in 1979 and served from 1982 to 1985, which is also true. These two statements do not contradict each other as they refer to two different periods of Siles Zuazo's presidency."
