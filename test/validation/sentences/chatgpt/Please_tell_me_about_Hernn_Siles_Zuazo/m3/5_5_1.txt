  "prefix": "In 1956, Siles Zuazo became the leader of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), which was a left-leaning political party that sought to modernize Bolivia and promote social justice. He was elected President of Bolivia in 1956, but his government was overthrown in a military coup in 1964. Siles Zuazo went into exile in Peru and later in France, where he continued to work for the restoration of democracy in Bolivia. He returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again, serving from 1982 to 1985. During his second presidency, he implemented economic reforms and social programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality.",

Statement 1 claims that he was elected President for a third time in 1985, while Statement 2 claims that his second presidency was cut short in 1985 due to a military coup. These two statements cannot both be true, as they present conflicting information about the same event."
