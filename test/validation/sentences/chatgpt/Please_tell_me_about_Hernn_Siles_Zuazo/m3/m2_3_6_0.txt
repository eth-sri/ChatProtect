He first became president in 1956, following a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship. During his presidency, he pursued a series of ambitious social and economic reforms, including agrarian reform, nationalization of mines, and the establishment of a national health care system. However, Siles Zuazo's first presidency was also marked by political instability and violence, as he faced opposition from conservative and military factions. He was forced to flee the country in 1964, following a military coup. Siles Zuazo returned to Bolivia in 1982.",
