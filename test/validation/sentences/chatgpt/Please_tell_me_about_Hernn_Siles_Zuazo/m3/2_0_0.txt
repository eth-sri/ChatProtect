  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Siles was first elected as President of Bolivia in 1956. The only difference is that statement 1 adds that his term was cut short by a military coup in 1964. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and provide additional information about Siles' presidency."
