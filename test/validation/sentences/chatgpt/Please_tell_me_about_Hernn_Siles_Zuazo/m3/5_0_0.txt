  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory. \n\nStatement 1 says that he became the leader of the MNR in 1956, while Statement 2 says that he became the President of Bolivia in the same year. However, Siles Zuazo did not become the President of Bolivia in 1956. He was actually elected as President in 1982, after serving as President previously from 1956 to 1960. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true."
