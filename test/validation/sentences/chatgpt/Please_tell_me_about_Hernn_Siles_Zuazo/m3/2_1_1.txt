  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. The first statement describes his first term as President being cut short by a military coup in 1964, leading him to go into exile in Chile and later in Peru. The second statement describes his eventual return to Bolivia and re-election as President in 1982, after continuing to advocate for democracy and social justice during his time in exile. Therefore, the two statements are complementary and do not contradict each other."
