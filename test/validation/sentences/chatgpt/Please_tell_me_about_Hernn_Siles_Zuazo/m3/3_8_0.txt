  "prefix": "Siles Zuazo was a member of the left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party, which played a key role in Bolivian politics in the mid-20th century. He first became president in 1956, following a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship. During his presidency, he pursued a series of ambitious social and economic reforms, including agrarian reform, nationalization of mines, and the establishment of a national health care system. However, Siles Zuazo's first presidency was also marked by political instability and violence, as he faced opposition from conservative and military factions. He was forced to flee the country in 1964, following a military coup. Siles Zuazo returned to Bolivia in 1982, following the downfall of another military dictatorship. He was elected president once again and served from 1982 to 1985. During this period, he continued his progressive agenda, enacting policies to promote land reform, improve access to education and healthcare, and expand workers' rights.",
