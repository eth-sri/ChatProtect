  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory as they provide different timelines for the beginning of his political career. Statement 1 suggests that he started his political career in the 1940s as a member of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), while Statement 2 suggests that he began his political career in the 1930s as a member of the Bolivian Socialist Falange party. As the two statements cannot both be true, they are contradictory."
