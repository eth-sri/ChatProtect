  "orig": "He was elected president once again and served from 1982 to 1985.",
  "alt": "He was elected to a second term as president in 1985, and during this time he continued to push for social and economic reforms, including the nationalization of the oil industry.",
  "prefix": "Siles Zuazo was a member of the left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party, which played a key role in Bolivian politics in the mid-20th century. He first became president in 1956, following a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship. During his presidency, he pursued a series of ambitious social and economic reforms, including agrarian reform, nationalization of mines, and the establishment of a national health care system. However, Siles Zuazo's first presidency was also marked by political instability and violence, as he faced opposition from conservative and military factions. He was forced to flee the country in 1964, following a military coup. Siles Zuazo returned to Bolivia in 1982, following the downfall of another military dictatorship.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he was elected president once again and served from 1982 to 1985, while Statement 2 says that he was elected to a second term as president in 1985. These two statements cannot both be true, as they present conflicting information about the number of times Siles Zuazo was elected president."
