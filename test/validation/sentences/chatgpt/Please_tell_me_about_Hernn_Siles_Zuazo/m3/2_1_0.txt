  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. The first statement explains that Siles' first term as President was cut short by a military coup in 1964, and he went into exile in Chile and later in Peru. The second statement explains that he returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again in 1982. Therefore, the two statements are not contradictory but rather provide different stages of Siles' political career."
