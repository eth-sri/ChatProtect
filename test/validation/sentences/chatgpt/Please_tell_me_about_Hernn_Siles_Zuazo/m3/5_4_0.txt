  "prefix": "In 1956, Siles Zuazo became the leader of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), which was a left-leaning political party that sought to modernize Bolivia and promote social justice. He was elected President of Bolivia in 1956, but his government was overthrown in a military coup in 1964. Siles Zuazo went into exile in Peru and later in France, where he continued to work for the restoration of democracy in Bolivia. He returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President once again, serving from 1982 to 1985.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. They both refer to his second presidency and mention his implementation of economic and social reforms aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in Bolivia. The only difference is that statement 2 specifies that there were several reforms, while statement 1 does not. However, this does not create a contradiction between the two statements."
