  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. While the first statement highlights the economic crisis and political turmoil during his third presidency, the second statement acknowledges his efforts to address the crisis through economic reforms. The fact that Siles Zuazo was ultimately forced to resign suggests that his reforms may not have been enough to fully stabilize the economy, leading to the implementation of further reforms by his successor. Therefore, both statements can be true and do not contradict each other."
