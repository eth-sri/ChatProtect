  "explanation": "The two statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. They both state that he returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President again in 1982, serving until 1985. The only difference is the placement of the year in the second statement, but it does not change the meaning or contradict the first statement."
