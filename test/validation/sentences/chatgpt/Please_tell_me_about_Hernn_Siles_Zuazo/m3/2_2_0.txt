  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention his election as President of Bolivia in 1982, but one specifies that it was a democratic election, while the other specifies that it was after the country's return to democracy. These statements complement each other and provide additional information about the circumstances of Siles' second presidency."
