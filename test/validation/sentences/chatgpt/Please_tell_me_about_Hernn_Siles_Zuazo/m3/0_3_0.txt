  "prefix": "Siles Zuazo was a member of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party and played a significant role in the Bolivian political scene during the mid-20th century. He first served as the President of Bolivia from 1956 to 1960, during which he implemented several progressive reforms, including land reform and the nationalization of Bolivia's tin mines. After a military coup ousted him from power in 1960, Siles Zuazo went into exile in Chile and later in Peru.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he returned to Bolivia in 1979 and was elected President again in 1982, serving until 1985. The only difference is in the phrasing of the second statement, which omits the phrase \"once again\" and places the time frame at the end of the sentence. However, both statements convey the same information and are consistent with each other."
