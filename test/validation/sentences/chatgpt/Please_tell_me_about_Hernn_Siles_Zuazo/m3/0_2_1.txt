  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he went into exile in 1960 after a military coup ousted him from power, while statement 2 says that he went into exile following a military coup in 1964 but returned to Bolivia in 1971 and served as President once again from 1982 to 1985. The two statements cannot both be true, as they provide different information about when Siles Zuazo went into exile and why."
