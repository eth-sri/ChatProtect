  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. The first statement mentions that his presidency was marked by economic crisis and political turmoil, which implies that he faced challenges during his time in office. The second statement provides further information about how he dealt with the economic crisis, stating that he implemented austerity measures. This is consistent with the idea that his presidency was marked by economic difficulties. The fact that he was later forced to resign and succeeded by someone who implemented economic reforms does not contradict the information provided in the second statement."
