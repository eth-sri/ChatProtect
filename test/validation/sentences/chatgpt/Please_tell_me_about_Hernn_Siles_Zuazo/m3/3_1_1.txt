  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are contradictory. Statement 1 says that he became president in 1956 after a popular uprising that overthrew the previous military dictatorship, while statement 2 says that he overthrew the military government in 1952 and became the President of Bolivia. These two statements cannot both be true, as they present different timelines and circumstances for Siles Zuazo's rise to power."
