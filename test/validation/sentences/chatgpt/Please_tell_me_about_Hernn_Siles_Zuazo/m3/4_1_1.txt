  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention his resignation from office in 1985, but they provide different reasons for it. Statement 1 suggests that his resignation was not voluntary and that he was forced out of office due to the economic crisis and political turmoil during his presidency. Statement 2 provides a more specific reason for his resignation, citing pressure from labor unions and opposition parties. Both statements also mention the economic reforms implemented by his successor, Victor Paz Estenssoro, which suggests that Siles Zuazo's presidency was indeed marked by economic crisis and that his resignation was followed by significant changes in economic policy."
