  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory, but they refer to different periods of his political career. Statement 1 is accurate, as Siles Zuazo was indeed elected President of Bolivia in 1979 and served until 1980. Statement 2, on the other hand, is partially incorrect, as Siles Zuazo was not elected President in 1956, but rather served as Vice President under President Estenssoro during that time. However, Siles Zuazo was elected President of Bolivia again in 1982, after a period of military rule. Therefore, while the statements are not contradictory, they do require clarification and accuracy."
