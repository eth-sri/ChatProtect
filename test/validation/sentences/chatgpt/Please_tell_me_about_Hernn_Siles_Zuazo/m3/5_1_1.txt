  "explanation": "The statements about Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo are not contradictory. Both statements mention the fact that his government was overthrown in a military coup in 1964, but they provide different contexts for this event. Statement 1 emphasizes that Siles Zuazo was elected President in 1956, while Statement 2 highlights the consequences of the coup for Bolivia's political stability. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Siles Zuazo's political career."
