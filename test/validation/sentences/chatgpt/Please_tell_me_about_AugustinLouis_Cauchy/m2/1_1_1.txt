  "orig": "He began his mathematical career by studying the works of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, and soon developed his own ideas and techniques.",
  "alt": "How did Cauchy develop his own ideas and techniques in mathematics? Cauchy developed his own ideas and techniques in mathematics through extensive research and experimentation. He was known for his rigorous approach to mathematical analysis and his development of the concept of limits. He also made significant contributions to complex analysis, number theory, and the theory of equations. Cauchy's work laid the foundation for many important mathematical concepts and techniques that are still used today.",
