  "target": "Please tell me about Augustin-Louis Cauchy",
  "orig": "His early work focused on calculus and analysis, where he developed the concept of limits and continuity, and introduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis.",
  "alt": "What concepts did Cauchy develop in calculus and analysis? Cauchy developed many concepts in calculus and analysis, including the Cauchy integral theorem, Cauchy's convergence test, Cauchy's theorem for partial differential equations, and the Cauchy-Riemann equations. He also made significant contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, including the development of the Cauchy integral formula and the Cauchy-Riemann equations.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He began his mathematical career by studying the works of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, and soon developed his own ideas and techniques.",
