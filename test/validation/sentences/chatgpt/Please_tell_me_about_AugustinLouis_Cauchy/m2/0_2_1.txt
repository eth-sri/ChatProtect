  "target": "Please tell me about Augustin-Louis Cauchy",
  "orig": "Some of his most important contributions include the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which describe the conditions for a function to be analytic, and the Cauchy integral theorem, which relates the values of a complex function on a closed curve to its values inside the curve.",
  "alt": "What is the Cauchy integral theorem and how does it relate to complex functions? The Cauchy integral theorem states that if a function is analytic (i.e., differentiable) within a closed contour, then the integral of that function around the contour is equal to zero. This theorem is important in complex analysis because it allows for the evaluation of complex integrals using only the properties of analytic functions. It also provides a way to determine whether a function is analytic or not within a given region.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime.",
