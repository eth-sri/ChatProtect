  "target": "Please tell me about Augustin-Louis Cauchy",
  "orig": "Some of his most important contributions include the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which describe the conditions for a function to be analytic, and the Cauchy integral theorem, which relates the values of a complex function on a closed curve to its values inside the curve.",
  "alt": "What are the Cauchy-Riemann equations and what do they describe? The Cauchy-Riemann equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the conditions for a complex function to be differentiable. They relate the partial derivatives of the function with respect to its real and imaginary components. These equations are fundamental in the study of complex analysis and are used to determine the analyticity of functions.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime.",
