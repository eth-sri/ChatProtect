  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Both statements mention his early work in mathematical analysis and calculus, with statement 1 providing more specific details about his contributions to the field, including the development of the concept of limits and continuity and the introduction of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis. Statement 2 also acknowledges his significant contributions to calculus, but does not provide as much specific information as statement 1. Overall, both statements are consistent with Cauchy's early focus on mathematical analysis and calculus."
