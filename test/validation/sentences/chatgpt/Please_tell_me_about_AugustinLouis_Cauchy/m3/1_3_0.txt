  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He began his mathematical career by studying the works of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, and soon developed his own ideas and techniques. His early work focused on calculus and analysis, where he developed the concept of limits and continuity, and introduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his significant contributions to mathematics, including calculus, analysis, complex analysis, number theory, algebra, and mathematical physics. The first statement specifically highlights his work in number theory and probability theory, while the second statement provides a more general overview of his contributions across multiple fields."
