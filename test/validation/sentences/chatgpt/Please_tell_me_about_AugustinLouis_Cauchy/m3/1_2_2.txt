  "orig": "His early work focused on calculus and analysis, where he developed the concept of limits and continuity, and introduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis.",
  "alt": "Cauchy is best known for his contributions to the concept of limits and continuity, which he introduced to mathematical analysis.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Both statements mention his contributions to the concept of limits and continuity in mathematical analysis. Statement 1 provides more specific information about his early work in calculus and analysis, including the introduction of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis. Statement 2 highlights Cauchy's overall impact on mathematical analysis and his lasting legacy in the field."
