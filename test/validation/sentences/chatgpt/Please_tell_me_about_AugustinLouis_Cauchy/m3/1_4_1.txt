  "target": "Please tell me about Augustin-Louis Cauchy",
  "orig": "He was also interested in the foundations of geometry and developed the concept of projective geometry.",
  "alt": "He was also a prolific writer, publishing over 700 papers and books throughout his career.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He began his mathematical career by studying the works of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, and soon developed his own ideas and techniques. His early work focused on calculus and analysis, where he developed the concept of limits and continuity, and introduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis. Cauchy also made important contributions to number theory, including the development of the Cauchy integral theorem and the Cauchy distribution in probability theory.",

  "tag": "ok",
  "wrong": "none",
  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. They both provide additional information about his interests and accomplishments beyond his contributions to calculus, analysis, and number theory. The fact that he developed the concept of projective geometry shows his broad range of mathematical interests, while the statement about his prolific writing highlights his productivity as a mathematician."
