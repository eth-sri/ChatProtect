  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Statement 1 focuses on his contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, while Statement 2 highlights his significant contributions to several branches of mathematics, including analysis, number theory, and algebra. Both statements are true and complement each other, providing a more comprehensive understanding of Cauchy's mathematical achievements."
