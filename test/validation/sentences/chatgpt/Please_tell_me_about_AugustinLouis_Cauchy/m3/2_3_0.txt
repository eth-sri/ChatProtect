  "orig": "Cauchy also made important contributions to the theory of differential equations, including the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, which is a fundamental result in the theory of ordinary differential equations.",
  "alt": "Cauchy is also known for his important contributions to the theory of differential equations, including the Cauchy integral theorem and the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris, France, and was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He began his mathematical career by working on mathematical physics, but later turned his attention to pure mathematics. He made important contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, including the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are fundamental to the modern theory of functions of a complex variable.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his important contributions to the theory of differential equations, but they highlight different specific theorems that he developed. Statement 1 mentions the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, while Statement 2 mentions the Cauchy integral theorem and the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem. Therefore, the statements complement each other and provide a more complete picture of Cauchy's contributions to mathematics."
