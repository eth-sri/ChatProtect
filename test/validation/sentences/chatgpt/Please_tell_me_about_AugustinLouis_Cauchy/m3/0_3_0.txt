  "orig": "Cauchy also made important contributions to number theory, including his work on the distribution of prime numbers and his proof of Fermat's little theorem.",
  "alt": "Cauchy also made significant contributions to the field of calculus, including the development of rigorous definitions for limits and continuity.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime. Some of his most important contributions include the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which describe the conditions for a function to be analytic, and the Cauchy integral theorem, which relates the values of a complex function on a closed curve to its values inside the curve.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. They both acknowledge his significant contributions to different areas of mathematics. Statement 1 highlights his work in number theory, while statement 2 focuses on his contributions to calculus. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other."
