  "orig": "In addition to his mathematical achievements, Cauchy was a prolific writer and published over 800 papers and books.",
  "alt": "Cauchy was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 700 papers during his lifetime.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He began his mathematical career by studying the works of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, and soon developed his own ideas and techniques. His early work focused on calculus and analysis, where he developed the concept of limits and continuity, and introduced the Cauchy-Riemann equations in complex analysis. Cauchy also made important contributions to number theory, including the development of the Cauchy integral theorem and the Cauchy distribution in probability theory. He was also interested in the foundations of geometry and developed the concept of projective geometry.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory, but they differ in the number of papers he published. Statement 1 claims that he published over 800 papers and books, while statement 2 states that he published over 700 papers. Both statements agree that Cauchy was a prolific mathematician and published a significant amount of work during his lifetime."
