  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Statement 1 explains that Cauchy initially worked on mathematical physics but later shifted his focus to pure mathematics. Statement 2 provides additional information about the beginning of his mathematical career, stating that he submitted a paper on calculus to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences at the age of 19. These statements do not contradict each other, but rather provide complementary information about Cauchy's career trajectory."
