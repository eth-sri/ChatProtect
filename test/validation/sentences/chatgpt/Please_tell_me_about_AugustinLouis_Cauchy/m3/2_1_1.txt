  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are contradictory. Statement 1 claims that Cauchy turned his attention to pure mathematics after beginning his career in mathematical physics, while statement 2 claims that he later turned his attention back to mathematical physics and made significant contributions to the field. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time."
