  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Statement 1 provides information about how Cauchy developed his own ideas and techniques in mathematics, while Statement 2 highlights the early start of his career as a mathematician. Both statements provide different but complementary information about Cauchy's life and work."
