  "alt": "His work on the distribution of prime numbers laid the foundation for modern analytic number theory.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime. Some of his most important contributions include the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which describe the conditions for a function to be analytic, and the Cauchy integral theorem, which relates the values of a complex function on a closed curve to its values inside the curve. Cauchy also made important contributions to number theory, including his work on the distribution of prime numbers and his proof of Fermat's little theorem.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Statement 1 highlights his contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, while Statement 2 focuses on his work in number theory. Both statements acknowledge his significant contributions to different areas of mathematics, without contradicting each other."
