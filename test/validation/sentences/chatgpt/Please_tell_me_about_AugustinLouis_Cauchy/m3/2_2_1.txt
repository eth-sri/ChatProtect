  "orig": "He made important contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, including the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are fundamental to the modern theory of functions of a complex variable.",
  "alt": "His important contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable are still studied and used today in modern mathematics.",
  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris, France, and was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He began his mathematical career by working on mathematical physics, but later turned his attention to pure mathematics.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Statement 1 highlights Cauchy's important contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable, specifically the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Statement 2 emphasizes that these contributions are still relevant and studied in modern mathematics. Both statements complement each other and support the idea that Cauchy's work in this area was significant and enduring."
