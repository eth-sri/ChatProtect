  "prefix": "Cauchy was born in Paris and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime. Some of his most important contributions include the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which describe the conditions for a function to be analytic, and the Cauchy integral theorem, which relates the values of a complex function on a closed curve to its values inside the curve. Cauchy also made important contributions to number theory, including his work on the distribution of prime numbers and his proof of Fermat's little theorem. He was also one of the pioneers of the theory of functions of a complex variable, and his work on this subject laid the foundation for the development of modern complex analysis.",

  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Both statements acknowledge his prominent role in the French Academy of Sciences and his contributions to the field of mathematics. The first statement adds that he played an important role in the development of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, while the second statement emphasizes his key role in advancing mathematics. These statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
