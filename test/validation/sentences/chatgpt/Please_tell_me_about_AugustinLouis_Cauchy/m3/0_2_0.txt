  "explanation": "The statements about Augustin-Louis Cauchy are not contradictory. Both statements mention the Cauchy integral theorem as one of his important contributions, but they differ in the other contribution mentioned. Statement 1 mentions the Cauchy-Riemann equations, while Statement 2 mentions the development of complex function theory. These are not contradictory, but rather complementary, as both contributions are related to Cauchy's work on complex analysis."
