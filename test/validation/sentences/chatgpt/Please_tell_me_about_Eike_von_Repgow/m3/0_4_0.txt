Statement 1 suggests that Eike von Repgow had a good education and training in law, which could have prepared him to write the \"Sachsenspiegel\". Statement 2 suggests that he was a knight and a judge, which could have given him the practical experience and knowledge of the legal system necessary to write the \"Sachsenspiegel\". Both statements provide different aspects of Eike von Repgow's background and experience that could have contributed to his authorship of the \"Sachsenspiegel\"."
