The \"Sachsenspiegel\" was a comprehensive legal code that covered both civil and criminal law. It was written in Middle Low German, which was the language spoken by the common people at the time. The \"Sachsenspiegel\" was widely used throughout Germany and other parts of Europe for centuries. It was even used as a source of law in some areas until the 19th century.",
