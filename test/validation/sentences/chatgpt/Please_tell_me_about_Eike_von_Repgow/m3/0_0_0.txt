  "explanation": "The statements about Eike von Repgow are not contradictory. Both statements provide information about the \"Sachsenspiegel\" and its author. Statement 1 describes the content of the \"Sachsenspiegel\" as a collection of laws and customs used in Saxony during the 12th and 13th centuries. Statement 2 identifies Eike von Repgow as the author of the \"Sachsenspiegel\" and specifies that it is a medieval German legal code written in the 13th century. Therefore, both statements complement each other and do not contradict each other."
