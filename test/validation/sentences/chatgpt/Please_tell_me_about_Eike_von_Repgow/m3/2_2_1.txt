  "explanation": "The statements about Eike von Repgow are not contradictory. Both statements mention that he was commissioned by the Archbishop of Magdeburg to create a legal code applicable to the people of Saxony, and that the result of his work was the \"Sachsenspiegel.\" The only difference is that statement 2 adds that the \"Sachsenspiegel\" became one of the most important legal codes in medieval Germany. Therefore, the statements are complementary and provide additional information about Eike von Repgow and his work."
