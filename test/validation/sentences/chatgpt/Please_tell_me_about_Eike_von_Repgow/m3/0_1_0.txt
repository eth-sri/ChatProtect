  "explanation": "The statements about Eike von Repgow are not contradictory. Both statements mention that the \"Sachsenspiegel\" covers a wide range of topics, including property law and criminal law. The only difference is that statement 1 includes marriage and inheritance as additional topics, while statement 2 includes family law instead. However, family law can be considered a broader category that encompasses marriage and inheritance, so the two statements are still consistent with each other."
