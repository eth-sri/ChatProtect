It covers a wide range of topics, including property rights, inheritance, marriage, and criminal law. The work was written in Middle Low German, which was the language of the common people at the time. Eike von Repgow is believed to have been born in the town of Repgow, near Magdeburg, in the early 13th century. He was a member of the local nobility and had a good education, which included training in law. He is thought to have written the \"Sachsenspiegel\" between 1220 and 1235, with the help of other legal scholars. The \"Sachsenspiegel\" was widely used in Germany for centuries and had a significant influence on the development of German law. It was also translated into other languages, including Dutch and Danish.",
