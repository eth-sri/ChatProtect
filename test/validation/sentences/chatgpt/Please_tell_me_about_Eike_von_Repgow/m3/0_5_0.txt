  "explanation": "The statements about Eike von Repgow are not contradictory. Both statements agree that he is believed to have written the \"Sachsenspiegel\" between 1220 and 1235. The only difference is that statement 1 suggests that he had help from other legal scholars, while statement 2 suggests that he drew on earlier legal codes and customs of the region. These two ideas are not mutually exclusive and could both be true. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
