  "explanation": "The statements about Spain are not contradictory. Both statements mention that Spain is divided into 17 autonomous regions, each with its own distinct culture. The only difference is that statement 1 specifically mentions language, while statement 2 mentions traditions. However, language is a significant aspect of culture, so it is reasonable to include it as a distinguishing factor between the regions. Overall, both statements provide accurate information about the diversity within Spain."
