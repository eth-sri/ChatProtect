Both statements emphasize the popularity of Marble Arch as a tourist attraction and a meeting point for visitors to Hyde Park. The only difference is that statement 2 presents visiting Marble Arch as a must-do activity for anyone exploring London, while statement 1 simply notes that it is often used as a meeting point. However, both statements convey a positive view of Marble Arch and its significance as a landmark in London."
