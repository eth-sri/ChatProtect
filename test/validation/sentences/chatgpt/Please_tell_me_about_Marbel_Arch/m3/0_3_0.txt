Both statements emphasize the arch's significance as a symbol of London's history and its popularity as a tourist attraction. The only difference is that the second statement adds a stronger emphasis on the arch being a \"must-see\" attraction for visitors to the city. However, both statements convey a positive view of Marble Arch and its importance to London's cultural heritage."
