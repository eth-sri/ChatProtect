  "explanation": "The statements about Marble Arch are not contradictory. Both statements mention that it is a popular spot for tourists to take photos and is often used as a backdrop for films and TV shows. The only difference is that statement 2 adds that it is often crowded with visitors trying to capture the beauty of the arch. However, this does not contradict the first statement as popularity and crowds often go hand in hand."
