Statement 1 implies that Marble Arch has been a popular tourist attraction and meeting point for over a century, which includes the time since its construction in 1827. Statement 2 simply specifies the year of its construction and confirms that it has been a popular tourist attraction since then. Both statements are consistent with each other."
