The first statement describes the physical characteristics of the arch, while the second statement provides information about its location. Both statements can be true at the same time without contradicting each other. The fact that Marble Arch is a popular spot for tourists and a common backdrop for films and TV shows does not affect its location at the junction of Oxford Street, Park Lane, and Edgware Road."
