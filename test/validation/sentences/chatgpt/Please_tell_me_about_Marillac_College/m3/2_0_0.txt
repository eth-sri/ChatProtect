  "explanation": "The statements about Marillac College are not contradictory, but rather the second statement is a simplified version of the first statement. Both statements convey the same information that Marillac College was a women's college located in St. Louis, Missouri. The only difference is that the first statement specifies that it was a private Catholic college, while the second statement omits that detail. Therefore, the statements are not contradictory."
