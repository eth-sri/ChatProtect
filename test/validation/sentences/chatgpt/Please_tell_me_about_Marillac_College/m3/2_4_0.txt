  "explanation": "The statements about Marillac College are not contradictory. While Statement 1 highlights the vibrant campus life and variety of student organizations and activities, Statement 2 provides information about the small student body size. These two statements can coexist as a small student body does not necessarily mean a lack of campus life or student involvement in activities. In fact, a smaller student body may even lead to a more tight-knit community and more opportunities for involvement. Therefore, the statements complement each other rather than contradicting each other."
