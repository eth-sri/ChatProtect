The first statement highlights her achievements in tennis, while the second statement emphasizes her historic accomplishment of being the first Israeli woman to break into the top 20 of the WTA rankings. The first statement focuses on her on-court abilities, while the second statement highlights her off-court impact on Israeli tennis. Both statements provide different aspects of Pe\u2019er\u2019s career and do not contradict each other."
