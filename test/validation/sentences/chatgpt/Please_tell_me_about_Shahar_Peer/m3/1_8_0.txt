  "explanation": "The statements about Shahar Pe\u2019er are not contradictory. While both statements refer to the incident where she was denied a visa to play in the Dubai Tennis Championships, they focus on different outcomes. Statement 1 suggests that the incident led to changes in the tournament\u2019s policy, while Statement 2 suggests that it led to widespread condemnation and calls for the tournament to be moved to a different location. Both outcomes could have occurred simultaneously or independently, without contradicting each other."
