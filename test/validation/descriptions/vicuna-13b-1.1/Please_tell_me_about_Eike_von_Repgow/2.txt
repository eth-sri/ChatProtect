  "text": "Eike von Repgow (sometimes spelled \"Repkowe\") was a 13th-century German lawyer and writer who is best known for his work \"\u00dcber die Ritter\", a treatise on the Knightly virtues and ideals of chivalry. The work was written in the Middle High German vernacular, rather than Latin, which was the traditional language of legal writing at the time.\n\nVon Repgow was born in the town of L\u00fcchow, in the region of Wendland in modern-day Lower Saxony, Germany. He studied law at the University of Bologna in Italy and later became a professor of law at the University of Rostock.\n\nHis \"\u00dcber die Ritter\" is considered one of the most important works of medieval German literature and is a key source for our understanding of the Knightly ideals and values of the time. The work discusses the duties and responsibilities of knights, including their obligations to God, their lords, and their fellow knights, as well as their role in defending the weak and promoting justice.\n\nVon Repgow's work was widely read and imitated in the Middle Ages and had a significant influence on the development of the chivalric code. He is also known for his other works on legal and philosophical topics, such as \"Grundriss der Wissenshaft\" and \"Erkenntnisse der Dingen\".\n\nIn addition, von Repgow is also credited with having played an important role in the development of the Hanseatic League, a powerful trading network that emerged in the North European plains and coastal regions during the Late Middle Ages.",
