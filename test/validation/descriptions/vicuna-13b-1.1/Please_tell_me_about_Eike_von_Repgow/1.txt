  "text": "Eike von Repgow (c. 1240-c. 1310) was a German jurist and legal scholar who is considered one of the founders of the science of constitutional law. He was born in the town of Reppagow, in what is now Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, and was educated at the universities of Bologna and Padua in Italy.\n\nAfter completing his education, von Repgow returned to Germany and became a professor of law at the University of Rostock. He was also appointed as a judge in the High Court of the Duchy of Mecklenburg, where he played a significant role in the development of the region's legal system.\n\nVon Repgow's most important work is his \"Constitutiones Razzolorum\" (Rolles of Rights), also known as the \"Lex Razzolorum,\" which is considered one of the first written constitutions in Europe. This legal code was based on the customary law of Mecklenburg, but was also influenced by von Repgow's studies of Roman law and the legal systems of other countries.\n\nThe \"Lex Razzolorum\" was a comprehensive legal code that dealt with a wide range of issues, including criminal law, civil law, and procedures for the enforcement of laws. It also established the principle of separation of powers, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government being separate but coequal.\n\nVon Repgow's work was influential in the development of constitutional law in Germany and Europe, and his approach to legal analysis and interpretation was widely adopted by later legal scholars. He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of legal thought and the development of constitutional law.",
