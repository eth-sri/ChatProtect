  "text": "Mikhail Bulgakov was a Russian writer and playwright, born on May 15, 1891, in Kiev, Ukraine, and died on March 10, 1940, in Moscow, Russia. He is best known for his novel \"The Master and Margarita,\" which was written in the 1930s and 1940s but was not published in its entirety until 1966, long after Bulgakov's death.\n\n\"The Master and Margarita\" is a satirical allegory that combines elements of fantasy, horror, and political satire. The novel tells the story of a writer named Woland, who is modeled after the Devil, and his entourage, as they wreak havoc on the Soviet Union. The novel was initially rejected by Soviet censors for its critical portrayal of the Soviet government and was not published in full until after Bulgakov's death.\n\nBulgakov was also a playwright and wrote several plays, including \"The Days of the Turbins,\" which was produced in 1926 and was a commercial success. He also worked as a journalist and wrote articles and essays on a variety of topics, including literature, art, and politics.\n\nDespite his mixed relationship with the Soviet government, Bulgakov is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential Russian writers of the 20th century. His work is known for its wit, intelligence, and satirical edge, and he is frequently compared to other literary giants such as Gogol and Dostoevsky.",
