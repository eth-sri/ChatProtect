  "text": "Mikhail Bulgakov was a Russian author and playwright, best known for his novel \"The Master and Margarita.\" He was born on May 15, 1891, in Kiev, Ukraine, and died on March 10, 1940, in Moscow, Russia.\n\nBulgakov studied medicine in Kiev and later became a playwright, writing numerous plays throughout the 1920s and 30s. However, his work was often criticized by the Soviet authorities for being too avant-garde or unrealistic, and many of his plays were banned or censored.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bulgakov continued to write, and in 1940, he completed \"The Master and Margarita,\" a novel that satirized Soviet life and criticized the oppressive nature of the Soviet regime. The novel was not published in its entirety until 1966, nearly 25 years after Bulgakov's death.\n\n\"The Master and Margarita\" has since become a classic of 20th-century literature and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Russian novels of the 20th century. It has been translated into numerous languages and has inspired numerous adaptations, including films, plays, and musicals.\n\nBulgakov's other works include the plays \"The Days of the Turbins,\" \"The White Guard,\" and \"The Bathhouse,\" as well as the novel \"Heart of a Dog.\" Despite his controversial career, Bulgakov is now widely respected for his contributions to Soviet literature and his courage in speaking out against the Soviet regime.",
