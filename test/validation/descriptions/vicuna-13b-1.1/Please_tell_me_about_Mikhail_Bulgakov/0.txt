  "text": "Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940) was a Russian writer and playwright, best known for his novel \"The Master and Margarita\". The novel was written in the 1930s and 1940s but was not published in its entirety until 1966, long after Bulgakov's death.\n\nBorn in Kiev, Bulgakov studied medicine in Moscow, but he had a passion for writing and theater. He wrote several plays, including \"The White Guard,\" which was based on his experiences during the Russian Revolution. However, his work was often criticized by the Soviet authorities and he struggled to have his plays produced.\n\n\"The Master and Margarita\" is a satirical novel that criticizes the Soviet regime and the oppressive environment in which Bulgakov lived. Despite the novel's criticism of the Soviet Union, it has been widely popular and has been translated into many languages.\n\nBulgakov was also known for his other works such as \"Heart of a Dog,\" a satirical novella about a man who turns into a dog, and \"The Devil's Wheel,\" a satirical play about the devil and the Soviet regime.\n\nBulgakov died in 1940, at the age of 48, from a heart attack, but his work continued to be published posthumously.",
