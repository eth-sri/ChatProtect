  "text": "Marble Arch is a large, white marble gateway located in London, England. It was originally built as the entrance to Buckingham Palace in the mid-19th century, but was later moved to its current location in 1851, where it serves as a grand ceremonial entrance to the city.\n\nThe arch was designed by Edward Hodges Bailey, an architect who was responsible for many of the buildings in the area. It is made of white Carrara marble, which is a type of marble that is renowned for its whiteness and purity. The arch has a neoclassical design, with a broad, curved top and a series of decorative urns and vases.\n\nThe Marble Arch is a popular tourist attraction in London, and is often used as a backdrop for photographs. It is also a symbol of the city's grand architecture and history, and is considered an important part of the city's cultural heritage.",
