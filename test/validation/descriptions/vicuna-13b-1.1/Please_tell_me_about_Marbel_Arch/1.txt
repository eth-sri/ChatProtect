  "text": "Marbel Arch is a geological formation in the Middle East, specifically in Jordan. It is a natural arch made of marble, a type of rock formed from limestone that has been metamorphosed due to high temperature and pressure.\n\nThe Marbel Arch is located in the Wadi Rum Protected Area, which is a desert valley that forms part of the Arabian Desert. The protected area is known for its stunning landscapes, including sand dunes, rock formations, and ancient inscriptions and drawings.\n\nThe Marbel Arch is a popular tourist destination due to its unique natural beauty. Visitors can hike to the arch and explore the surrounding area, which is home to a variety of plant and animal life. The arch is particularly notable for its size and the fact that it is made of marble, which is a relatively soft rock that is prone to erosion. Despite this, the Marbel Arch has managed to withstand the forces of nature for thousands of years and remains a stunning natural wonder in the Middle East.",
