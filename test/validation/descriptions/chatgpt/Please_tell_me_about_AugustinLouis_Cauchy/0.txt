  "prompt": "Please tell me about Augustin-Louis Cauchy",
  "text": "Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to several areas of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, and number theory. He is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century.\n\nCauchy was born in Paris and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a prolific mathematician, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime. Some of his most important contributions include the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which describe the conditions for a function to be analytic, and the Cauchy integral theorem, which relates the values of a complex function on a closed curve to its values inside the curve.\n\nCauchy also made important contributions to number theory, including his work on the distribution of prime numbers and his proof of Fermat's little theorem. He was also one of the pioneers of the theory of functions of a complex variable, and his work on this subject laid the foundation for the development of modern complex analysis.\n\nIn addition to his mathematical contributions, Cauchy was also a prominent member of the French Academy of Sciences and played an important role in the development of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He was a devout Catholic and wrote extensively on the relationship between science and religion.",
