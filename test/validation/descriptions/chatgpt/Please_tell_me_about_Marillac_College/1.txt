  "prompt": "Please tell me about Marillac College",
  "text": "Marillac College was a Catholic women's college located in St. Louis, Missouri. It was founded in 1916 by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul and named after St. Louise de Marillac, a co-founder of the Daughters of Charity. The college offered undergraduate degrees in liberal arts, education, nursing, and social work.\n\nMarillac College was known for its commitment to social justice and community service. The college had a strong emphasis on experiential learning and required all students to complete a service-learning project as part of their curriculum. The college also had a close relationship with the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, where many nursing students completed their clinical rotations.\n\nIn 1998, due to declining enrollment and financial difficulties, Marillac College was merged with St. Louis University, another Catholic institution in St. Louis. Today, the former Marillac College campus is home to the St. Louis University School of Law.",
