  "text": "Marble Arch is a white marble monument located in the center of London, England. It was designed by John Nash in 1827 as a grand entrance to Buckingham Palace. However, it was relocated to its current location at the junction of Oxford Street, Park Lane, and Edgware Road in 1851.\n\nThe arch is 45 feet high and features intricate carvings and sculptures, including four lions at the base. It has been a popular tourist attraction and meeting point in London for over a century.\n\nIn recent years, the area around Marble Arch has undergone significant redevelopment, with new shops, restaurants, and hotels opening up in the surrounding streets. It is also a popular spot for protests and demonstrations due to its central location and visibility.",
