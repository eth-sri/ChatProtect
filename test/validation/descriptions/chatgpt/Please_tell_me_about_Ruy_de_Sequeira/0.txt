  "text": "Ruy de Sequeira (c. 1465 \u2013 c. 1530) was a Portuguese explorer and navigator who played an important role in the early Portuguese discoveries and colonization of the East Indies. He was born in Portugal and joined the Portuguese navy at a young age. He was appointed as the captain of the ship S\u00e3o Jorge in 1508 and led several expeditions to the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn 1509, Sequeira was sent by King Manuel I of Portugal to establish trade relations with the Sultan of Malacca, a strategic port city on the Malay Peninsula. He arrived in Malacca with a fleet of four ships and was welcomed by the Sultan, who allowed him to establish a Portuguese factory (trading post) in the city. Sequeira also explored the nearby islands of Sumatra and Java, and made contact with local rulers and traders.\n\nIn 1510, Sequeira was replaced by Afonso de Albuquerque as the governor of Portuguese India, but he continued to serve as a navigator and explorer. He participated in the conquest of Goa in 1510 and the capture of the island of Socotra in 1507. He also explored the Red Sea and the coast of East Africa, and made contact with the ruler of Ethiopia.\n\nSequeira is considered one of the most important Portuguese explorers of the early 16th century, and his expeditions paved the way for the Portuguese colonization of the East Indies. He died around 1530, and his legacy is celebrated in Portugal and in the countries he explored.",
