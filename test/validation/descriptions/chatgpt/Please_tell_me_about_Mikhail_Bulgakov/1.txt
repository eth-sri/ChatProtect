  "text": "Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940) was a Russian writer and playwright best known for his novel \"The Master and Margarita.\" He was born in Kiev, Ukraine and studied medicine before turning to writing. Bulgakov's early works were censored by the Soviet government, but he gained recognition with his play \"The Days of the Turbins,\" which was later adapted into a novel.\n\nBulgakov's writing often dealt with the struggles of individuals in a repressive society, and he frequently used elements of fantasy and satire in his work. \"The Master and Margarita,\" his most famous novel, is a complex and surreal tale that blends elements of Christianity, mythology, and political satire.\n\nDespite his success, Bulgakov faced constant censorship and persecution from the Soviet government. He was often forced to revise his work to appease government officials, and many of his plays were banned from production. Bulgakov died in 1940 at the age of 48, and much of his work was not published in its original form until after his death. Today, he is considered one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and his works continue to be studied and admired around the world.",
