He was born in La Paz, Bolivia and studied law and economics at the University of La Paz.\n\nSiles was first elected as President in 1956, but his term was cut short by a military coup in 1964. He went into exile in Chile and later in Peru, where he continued to advocate for democracy and social justice in Bolivia.\n\nIn 1982, Siles was elected President again, this time in a democratic election. He implemented economic and social reforms aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, but his government faced challenges from inflation, political instability, and opposition from conservative forces.\n\nSiles resigned from office in 1985, citing health reasons, and was succeeded by his Vice President, V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro. He continued to be active in Bolivian politics and served as a senator until his death in 1996.\n\nSiles is remembered as a champion of democracy and social justice in Bolivia, and his legacy continues to influence Bolivian politics today.",
