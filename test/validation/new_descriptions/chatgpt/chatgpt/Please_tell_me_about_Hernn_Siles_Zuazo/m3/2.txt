  "text": "Siles was first elected as President in 1956. He went into exile in Chile and later in Peru, where he continued to advocate for democracy and social justice in Bolivia. In 1982, Siles was elected President again, this time in a democratic election. He implemented economic and social reforms aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, but his government faced challenges from inflation, political instability, and opposition from conservative forces. Siles resigned from office in 1985, citing health reasons, and was succeeded by his Vice President, V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro. He continued to be active in Bolivian politics and served as a senator until his death in 1996. Siles is remembered as a champion of democracy and social justice in Bolivia, and his legacy continues to influence Bolivian politics today.",
