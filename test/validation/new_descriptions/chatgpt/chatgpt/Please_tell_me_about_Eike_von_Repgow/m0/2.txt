  "text": "Eike von Repgow was a member of the lower nobility and served as a judge in the court of the Archbishop of Magdeburg. He was commissioned by the Archbishop to create a legal code that would be applicable to the people of Saxony. \n\nThe result of his work was the \"Sachsenspiegel,\" which was completed around 1235. The \"Sachsenspiegel\" was a comprehensive legal code that covered both civil and criminal law. It was written in Middle Low German, which was the language spoken by the common people at the time.\n\nThe \"Sachsenspiegel\" was widely used throughout Germany and other parts of Europe for centuries. It was even used as a source of law in some areas until the 19th century. Eike von Repgow's work was instrumental in the development of German legal tradition and had a lasting impact on the legal systems of many other countries.",
