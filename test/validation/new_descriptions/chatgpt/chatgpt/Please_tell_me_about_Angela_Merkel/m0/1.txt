  "text": "Born in Hamburg in 1954, Merkel grew up in East Germany and studied physics before entering politics. She became involved in the pro-democracy movement in East Germany in the late 1980s and joined the CDU after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nMerkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991 and rose through the ranks of the CDU to become the party's leader in 2000. She was elected as Chancellor in 2005 and has since overseen Germany's response to the global financial crisis, the European debt crisis, and the refugee crisis.\n\nMerkel is known for her conservative views on social issues and her commitment to free trade and European integration. She has been a key player in European politics and has been credited with helping to maintain stability in the European Union during a time of economic and political uncertainty.\n\nMerkel has been widely praised for her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Germany being seen as one of the most successful countries in Europe in terms of managing the outbreak. However, she has also faced criticism for her handling of the refugee crisis and for her government's policies on climate change.\n\nMerkel has announced that she will not seek re-election in 2021, marking the end of an era in German politics.",
